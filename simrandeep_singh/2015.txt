BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stanley Fischer: Nonbank financial intermediation, financial stability, and the road forward Speech by Mr Stanley Fischer, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the “Central Banking in the Shadows: Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Postcrisis” 20th Annual Financial Markets Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Stone Mountain, Georgia, 30 March 2015. *      *      * It is an honor to speak at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 20th Financial Markets Conference, and I am grateful to President Lockhart and the organizers for inviting me to do so.1 This evening I would like to take stock of progress on financial reforms in the nonbank financial sector and highlight some principles for approaching prudential regulation of this sector to further strengthen financial stability. The nonbank sector includes firms with diverse business models and practices, many of which differ greatly from those of banks. Even so, nonbank firms and activities can pose the same key vulnerabilities as banks, including high leverage, excessive maturity transformation, and complexity, all of which can lead to financial instability. The reforms undertaken to date reflect both the differences and similarities between the nonbank and bank sectors. While there has been progress on the financial reform front, we should not be complacent about the stability of the financial system. Regulation often creates incentives for activity to move outside the regulatory perimeter, and market participants respond to incentives. Thus we should expect that further reforms will certainly be needed down the road. The nonbank sector was an important source of vulnerability in the crisis As you know, the nonbank financial sector in the United States is larger, and plays a more important role, than it does in most other countries. In recent years, about two-thirds of nonfinancial credit market debt has been held by nonbanks, which includes market-based funding by securitization vehicles and mutual funds as well as by institutions such as insurance companies and finance companies. Nonbanks are involved in many activities within the financial system as well, such as securities lending. The nonbank sector has produced material benefits: increased market liquidity, greater diversity of funding sources, and – it is often claimed – a more efficient allocation of risk to investors. However, threats to the stability of the overall financial system have also increased, as was evident in the recent financial crisis. It is now eight years since major cracks in the financial system that led to the Global Financial Crisis first appeared in nonbank entities and activities. While the causes of the crisis were complex, I will start by telling part of the tale of how nonbank distress was transmitted to the broader financial system. The story begins with nonbank mortgage companies, which were important originators of subprime and prime mortgage loans, typically securitizing them or selling them to investment banks to be securitized. Rumors of troubles among these firms were circulating in 2006 as house prices started to decline, and a large firm filed for bankruptcy in December 2006.2 Then New Century, at one point the second largest subprime lender, filed for bankruptcy in April 2007 because its funding had disappeared as a result of fears about losses. Many more followed in 2007 and 2008. Replacement of nonbank lenders’ capacity to process mortgage applications and to fund mortgage loans occurred only partially and slowly.                                                 1  The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Board, on the Federal Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System. 2  Ownit Mortgage Solutions, one of the top 20 subprime mortgage originators nationally, filed for bankruptcy on December 28, 2006. Virtually all such firms have since either failed or been acquired. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Next step: The distress in mortgage markets was amplified in the broader financial system in several ways, including something similar to a bank run but which instead occurred on asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) vehicles. These vehicles invested in private-label mortgage securitizations and other long-term debt securities but were funded with short-term commercial paper. Buyers of the commercial paper issued by the ABCP vehicles withdrew funding starting in the late summer of 2007. The volume of assets in the vehicles was large, about $700 billion, and after the run, the ability of the financial system to fund credit through many types of asset-backed securities became constrained.3 The runs on ABCP also put considerable pressure on the banking system because of the liquidity backstops that banks had provided to the vehicles.4  Some of the guarantors also insured mortgage-backed securities, and when doubts arose about the ability of the guarantors to pay claims on mortgage-backed securities, the credibility of their guarantees of municipal securities was also reduced. Municipalities then found it more difficult and costly to issue debt even though their activities were otherwise unrelated to subprime mortgages.5  Next, the crisis spread to nonbank finance companies, which made a substantial fraction of consumer loans in the United States – for example, auto and credit card loans. As the crisis went on, the ability of such lenders to fund themselves through securitizations and commercial paper became increasingly constrained. For a period after the failure of Lehman Brothers, many investors were unwilling to buy commercial paper and asset-backed securities at any price, and, as a result, finance companies faced tight funding constraints. In turn, the finance companies cut credit availability, which sharply depressed purchases of consumer durables, including automobiles. These examples highlight five lessons. One is that the recent crisis first manifested itself in the nonbank sector and was worse for the nonbank sector than for banks. Almost all the examples of financial distress mentioned so far occurred before stress in the commercial banking system became acute, and in most cases well before. For example, only three commercial banks failed in the United States in 2007, and commercial bank distress did not peak until the end of 2008 and later. A second lesson is that nonbank distress can harm the real economy. Mortgages, auto loans, and credit through securities issuance became harder to obtain. Some of the slack was taken up by commercial banks, but credit contracted sharply, and millions of Americans suffered. Third lesson: Many of the problems at nonbanks were similar to the problems that plagued banks. These problems included insolvency, illiquidity (by which I mean the loss of access to funding even if the nonbank was solvent), and a general loss of confidence, in which counterparties of all kinds became reluctant to deal with some nonbanks. Fourth lesson: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) can handle a bank insolvency by keeping the bank’s functions running while it pays off depositors and finds buyers for the bank’s assets. The Federal Reserve, as a central bank, can address bank illiquidity using its lender-of-last-resort authority. Bank supervisory agencies can address a loss of confidence by actions such as the stress tests conducted in the spring of 2009. However the lack of such powers for nonbanks made it much more difficult for the authorities to address the                                                 3  See Daniel Covitz, Nellie Liang, and Gustavo Suarez (2013), “The Evolution of a Financial Crisis: Collapse of the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Market,” Journal of Finance, vol. 68 (June), pp. 815–48. 4  Runs on the repurchase agreement (repo) funding of asset-backed securities were also troublesome for both banks and nonbanks. See Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick (2012), “Securitized Banking and the Run on Repo,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 104 (June), pp. 425–51. 5  Moreover, state and municipal borrowers had been issuing long-term debt while paying short-term interest rates by using structures such as variable-rate demand notes (VRDNs), which gave holders the right to put the securities back to liquidity providers on short notice. When the money market fund investors that held VRDNs became worried about their ability to get their money out at short notice, the volume of putbacks rose, and these developments ultimately led to increased payment obligations for some municipalities. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  distress of nonbanks and its influence on the financial system. Before the crisis, the authorities had few policy levers to provide liquidity or to resolve failures of nonbanks in a way that would avoid serious spillovers. Liquidity was ultimately provided to some nonbank markets, such as the markets for securities backed by consumer and business assets, but the facilities were far from simple and took substantial time to create and implement.6  Finally, nonbank distress can transmit to the banking sector through many channels, such as counterparty relationships, disruptions in funding markets, and knock-on effects of asset fire sales. The failure of Lehman provides a good example. It was a nonbank, and its failure both imposed direct losses on its many types of counterparties and disrupted many markets with negative effects on banks. Principles for prudential regulation of nonbank intermediaries and activities It is widely understood that any regulation of nonbanks should fit their activities and the vulnerabilities they pose, which implies that not every nonbank financial institution or activity necessarily needs to be regulated. The two key principles for prudential regulation of nonbanks when it is warranted, are simple: First, we should be attentive to solvency and liquidity; second, we should recognize that the financial system will change over time, and thus close monitoring and analysis of the system are essential. Insolvency and illiquidity are classic financial stability concerns. And as mentioned, they were common themes of the distress at nonbanks that we observed during the crisis. Thus, we will not go far wrong if we begin by considering how to promote solvency and liquidity, taking into account the unique structures and activities of each type of nonbank. Liquidity challenges vary across nonbank firms and activities. In some, the issue is whether a firm can fund itself in a distressed situation. For example, a broker-dealer that relies heavily on short-term wholesale funding may find its funding evaporating at the first sign of trouble – a situation that could force the sale of assets at fire sale prices. One way to mitigate such problems is by having direct restrictions on the structure of liabilities, such as on their duration or on the use of wholesale funding. Analogously with banks, one could also imagine requiring some nonbanks to maintain buffers of highly liquid assets that are sized according to the risk that their liabilities will run off quickly in a stress situation. In other nonbanks, withdrawable liabilities are part of the structure of the entity or activity, and what varies is the degree of mismatch between the liquidity of assets and liabilities. For example, some open-ended mutual funds offer daily withdrawal privileges but invest in assets that take longer to sell and settle, giving investors an incentive to withdraw quickly when distress arises. The fire sales of assets that may result can depress asset prices and increase volatility, with knock-on effects on other institutions and markets. Concerns have grown about this liquidity mismatch as the aggregate value of less liquid assets in such funds has grown. In part because of this concern, in a December Federal Register notice last year, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) requested public comment on potential systemic risks posed by asset manager activities and products. To promote solvency, one could impose ratio-type capital requirements, such as leverage ratio requirements or risk-based requirements. An alternative is to require that firms perform regular stress tests to demonstrate that they can remain solvent and continue to lend even under stress. In the Fed’s case, it has chosen to impose all of these requirements on banks, but these requirements cannot simply be applied, as is, to nonbanks.                                                 6  See Gorton and Metrick, “Securitized Banking,” in note 4, op.cit.; Jeremy Stein (2012), “Monetary Policy as Financial Stability Regulation,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 127, pp. 57–95; Robin Greenwood, Samuel Hanson, and Jeremy Stein (2014), “A Comparative-Advantage Approach to Government Debt Maturity,” Journal of Finance, vol. 65, pp. 993–1028. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It is well known that solvency and liquidity can be difficult to separate during stress periods because fears about solvency, even if unfounded, can prompt a run. Thus, one could also imagine promoting both solvency and liquidity at some nonbanks by imposing restrictions on their structure or activities in ways that reduce the likelihood of runs. An example of this is recent changes by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regulations for prime money market mutual funds. Starting in 2016, prime institutional money funds will be required to publish a floating net asset value rather than a stable value of $1 per unit. Stable-value funds, as we saw during the crisis, can be vulnerable to an unexpected “break the buck” event that leads to a run. Under the new rules, funds can also impose limitations on withdrawals of liabilities and can impose liability redemption fees. The SEC considered requiring money market funds to hold some capital but chose not to do so. Only time will tell whether the adopted reforms have the intended run-damping effects, but if they do, capital will be much less necessary. Some may raise concerns that increased regulation of nonbanks will only increase moral hazard and increase risk to the system on net. But moral hazard may already be present. Over the past 20 years and more, governments have sometimes acted to contain damage from distress at nonbanks because of the economic damage that might have resulted from a failure to act. We should always be mindful of moral hazard incentives and seek to contain them, but well-designed regulation might reduce rather than increase moral hazard. In the banking sector, bank regulators have focused on improving resolution planning at banks and enhancing the ability of the FDIC to manage the resolution of a systemically important firm in a way that mitigates spillovers to the economy. For example, proposals are now under consideration to require the largest and most interconnected banks to maintain a buffer of debt that could be converted to equity or that could otherwise absorb losses upon failure. Such proposals could be viewed as a form of solvency regulation and this form of loss-absorbing capital might be appropriate for some of the largest and most interconnected nonbanks as well. In addition, nonbank intermediation often involves complex chains of activity encompassing many entities and markets. Such chains tend to increase the web of interconnections in the financial system that, in some circumstances, can increase the likelihood or severity of systemic stress. For example, movements in collateral values can trigger margin calls and fire sales of assets, and thus activities that depend on market-valued collateral can be vulnerable. The Financial Stability Board is currently considering reforms for margins on securities financing transactions. Other interconnections involve exposures to counterparty default. The new regulatory regime for derivatives, which I will discuss in a moment, seeks to mitigate counterparty risk. It is often said that stronger regulation of the banking sector will cause activity to move outside the perimeter of regulation. This evolution also could lead to greater complexity, such as longer chains of interconnections, which makes it more difficult for market participants to understand the risks arising from their exposures. Examples of migration that have already occurred include the movement of many loans made to large corporations from banks to collateralized loan obligations, the securitization of many credit card receivables, and the securitization of mortgages. This kind of migration makes close monitoring by regulators particularly important. Authorities should monitor for changes that may arise in response to the new regulations or to changing economic and financial conditions. They will need information to do so, but for many nonbank entities, the flow of information is currently nonexistent or very limited and informal. Another force for evolution in the nonbank sector is the demand for safe money-like assets. Some argue that this demand for private money creation prompted the growth in “shadow banking” prior to the crisis.7 Indeed, whenever shortages develop, we might expect the nonbank                                                 7  See Gorton and Metrick, “Securitized Banking,” in note 4; Samuel G. Hanson, Andrei Shleifer, Jeremy C. Stein, and Robert W. Vishny (forthcoming), “Banks and Patient Fixed-Income Investors,” Journal of Financial Economics; and Zoltan Pozsar, Tobias Adrian, Adam Ashcraft, and Hayley Boesky (2010), “Shadow Banking,” Staff Report 458 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, July; revised February 2012). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  financial system to create assets that appear safe but that could in certain circumstances pose systemic risks. Progress to date We have seen some progress in improving the regulation of the nonbank financial sector. Let me mention four areas of reform. The first is the Dodd-Frank Act’s creation of the FSOC and the power it was given to designate individual nonbank firms as systemically important and thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve. The FSOC has designated four nonbank firms as systemically important.8 The FSOC is also a useful venue for regulators to collaborate on identifying emerging threats. And it is an important mechanism through which agencies can cooperate in responding to practices or firms that migrate outside of traditional regulatory perimeters. Second: securitization reform. A regulation that is now in the process of implementation requires securitizers to retain some of the risk of the securities that they create. That should incentivize them to structure securitizations in ways that better protect the holders of senior tranches from credit risk, although qualifying residential mortgages are exempt from the requirement. A third area is derivative reforms. To reduce complexity and pro-cyclicality, these reforms include moving standardized derivatives to central counterparties (CCPs) and requiring initial and variation margin for noncleared derivatives. Relatedly, as CCPs have gained prominence, regulators have become more focused on and concerned with their resilience, recovery, and resolution. In addition, regulators are working to improve the quality and standardization of data reported to swap data repositories, and are actively participating in international efforts to develop uniform identification standards to facilitate the aggregation of such data.9 A key issue is to understand how and to what extent market participants who use derivatives are exposed to each other. Besides the new money market mutual fund rules that I have already mentioned, a fourth example is additional data collection on specific holdings of money funds, which has enhanced stability by providing investors with more information to better evaluate risks. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated the establishment of the Office of Financial Research in order to help promote financial stability through the measurement and analysis of risks, the conduct of essential research, and the collection and standardization of financial data. Data collection has begun for hedge funds and progress is being made in collecting data on repurchase agreements and securities lending. Nevertheless, some nonbank firms and activities – including concerning the volume and uses of derivatives – are still opaque. To sum up, much has been done to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial system, but more will need to be done. We must remain vigilant for changes in the system that increase systemic risk, and we should make appropriate changes to regulation and the structure of regulation as necessary. Recent regulatory changes, including a macroprudential approach on the part of U.S. regulators, should help us to do that.10 But we should never forget the International Monetary Fund’s all-purpose warning whenever it has been tempted to give an economy a clean bill of health: Complacency must be avoided.                                                 8  The four firms designated by the FSOC as systemically important are American International Group, Inc.; Prudential Financial, Inc.; General Electric Capital Corporation, Inc.; and MetLife, Inc. 9  Due to the critical nature of overseas derivatives data and the need to standardize these data for regulatory analysis, the CFTC and the OFR in 2014 formed a partnership to standardize and enhance the quality of the data collected by CFTC-registered swap data repositories. Important work on standardizing derivatives data is also under way at the international level. 10  This change is reflected in the setting up of the LISCC – the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Manuel Sánchez: Mexico’s reforms progress and economic outlook Remarks by Mr Manuel Sánchez, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mexico, at the 2015 Institute of International Finance (IIF) Latin America Economic Forum, Busan, Republic of Korea, 28 March 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank the Institute of International Finance for the invitation to participate in this conference. It is an honor to share the panel with such distinguished speakers and to be in South Korea, an economy that has shown extraordinarily rapid development in the last few decades, achieving the level of an industrialized nation in an amazingly short lapse of time. Mexico has benefited greatly from economic ties with South Korea. In particular, this country is the second most important source of investment from Asia to Mexico, especially in manufacturing, commerce and mining, and it is also a significant trading partner. In this talk, I would like to touch first on structural reforms recently undertaken in Mexico and, second, comment on Mexico’s economic outlook. As usual, my views are entirely my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Bank of Mexico or its Governing Board. Mexico’s progress on structural reforms Mexico has embraced an ample program of structural reforms encompassing labor, education, the financial system, telecommunications, and energy, among other areas. The general aim is to promote greater market flexibility, investment in both human and physical capital, and competition, thereby boosting total factor productivity growth, the stagnation of which has inhibited long-term overall economic expansion. Legislative changes necessary for the reforms have been passed by Congress, and the country is currently in the process of implementing them. Challenges are inherent in this task. As all of us know, the effectiveness of reforms anywhere in the world rests heavily on the details. Today, I would like to bring you up to date specifically on the telecommunications and energy reforms, given the essential role these sectors play in the overall economy and consumer wellbeing. The telecommunications sector has been characterized by limited access and high cost. In both telecoms and broadcasting services competition has been scant, with each sector dominated by one company. In particular, the privatization of the government telephone operator more than two decades ago transferred exclusive fixed-line rights to one buyer, without adequate regulation favoring serious competition. In the following years, new providers of telecoms services encountered a playing field that was not at all level. While some price reductions occurred thanks to incipient competition, services remained expensive and their quality low by international standards. The telecommunications reform seeks to remedy these problems by facilitating greater competition and, until an acceptably competitive environment is achieved, by clamping restrictions especially on dominant players, defined as those companies with a market share greater than 50 percent in telecoms or broadcasting, or those judged by the regulatory authority to have significant power in specific market segments. To promote competition, barriers to the entry of new players were reduced. Now, 100 percent foreign ownership is permitted in telecoms and 49 percent in broadcasting. Also, licenses generally allow operators to offer a broad basket of services, provided that certain non-concentration requirements are met. In broadcasting, two new national digital television networks have recently been granted through a public bidding process. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In the case of telecoms, the new law eases customer mobility across operators. For example, they have to unblock handsets when contracts expire or the consumer pays for the equipment. Also, operators must implement portability for fixed and mobile telephone numbers within 24 hours of receiving the request and free of charge. To regulate market power in the overall industry, several measures have been undertaken. First, the new Federal Telecommunications Institute has authority that includes the sphere of competition. It will be helped by the fact that some legal recourses previously used by operators to circumvent the former authority’s resolutions indefinitely are no longer allowed. Second, a price restriction has been imposed on all telephony operators in the form of the elimination of national long distance fees, which in a world of digital networks and the internet were increasingly obsolete. Third, an asymmetric regime containing price and activity caps applies to dominant players, as long as they continue to be deemed as such. Notably, the main fixed and mobile telecoms provider cannot charge other operators for calls and text messages terminating in its network. This mobile operator is not allowed to charge fees to customers when they receive calls while outside their local service areas, nor can it price discriminate when customers call other companies’ phone numbers. The dominant player must also allow the sale and resale of mobile services to other concessionaries and the leasing of the last-mile network. It cannot offer TV services. In broadcasting, the dominant firm must allow competitors the lease of its infrastructure and cannot buy exclusivity for audiovisual content considered significant. This broadcaster is not permitted to own capital in the dominant telecoms provider. This reform has already yielded benefits. A declining trend in relative telecoms prices has deepened, and service providers have increased the variety of packages offered. In fact, competition between operators focuses increasingly on the speed and quality of data services provided through both fixed and mobile means. Another encouraging sign is the interest of international players in the Mexican market.1 To turn to our second focus, the energy sector has also suffered from high prices and frequently, insufficient supply. Crude oil production has been declining continuously since 2004. Inadequate pipeline infrastructure has limited lower-price gas imports, as well as lower-cost, more efficient distribution. Electricity prices in Mexico remain well above those in its key trading partners.2 Behind these problems lie decades of state control, with little or no benefit from outside participation. The energy reform seeks to confront this reality by allowing private participation in virtually all aspects of the sector. This includes public bidding for oil and gas exploration and production contracts, and permits for production of oil products and petrochemicals, transport, storage, distribution, and sale of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon products. Also, permits are to be granted to generate and sell electric power, as well as import electricity using Mexico’s National Electric System.3 The reform contemplates a wholesale market for the purchase and sale of electricity, with retail operations also possible. Electricity transmission and distribution remain in the hands of the state, with the outsourcing of private contractors permitted.                                                 1 For an analysis of recent price developments in the telecom services sector, see Banco de México (2015), Informe Trimestral, Octubre-Diciembre 2014, Box 1, February. 2 The negative impact of the inadequate infrastructure of the gas pipeline system is illustrated in Banco de México (2013), Inflation Report, July – September 2013, Box 2, November. 3 The National Electric System is mainly composed of the national transmission and general distribution networks, the power plants that deliver electricity to the national networks, and the equipment and facilities used to control the system itself. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 As to oil and gas exploration and extraction, four different types of contract are on offer, namely licenses, profit-sharing, production-sharing, and services. In the first three, private companies can register the value of the expected profits backed by the contracts on their books. In the wake of the so-called round zero in which Pemex applied for certain fields and was allocated some of them, the first round of public bidding has begun. Two auctions have been announced, one for exploration and production, and another for production only, both in shallow-water oil fields under production-sharing contracts. The auction allocations are expected in a matter of months. Fiscal and economic conditions in the contracts have been revised according to suggestions by auction participants, and in accordance with recent developments in oil markets. Three additional phases of this round will ensue, with the types of extraction increasing in level of difficulty or cost. Additionally, contracts have been auctioned and awarded to deliver gas in private pipelines, including a pipe from Texas to Chihuahua and another from Chihuahua to Durango. The first permit granted to a private agent to import electricity from a power station connected exclusively to the National Electric System has also been conceded. Significant foreign and domestic private investment could potentially materialize in this new environment. The changes should eventually allow more efficient energy-sector production and lower domestic gasoline and electricity prices through competitive markets. The economic outlook The Mexican economy shows signs of moderate recovery after a slowdown in 2012. The upturn is driven by industrial production, with manufacturing taking the lead, fueled by exports to the United States. Construction has recently picked up as well, while mining is still faltering, due mainly to oil production, on the decline since 2004. Domestic spending has also improved somewhat, with private investment showing more strength, and consumption gains unable to obtain traction. Analysts’ consensus forecasts for this year and next call for the economy to gradually pick up steam, pulled by positive U.S. performance.4Downside risks to the growth outlook include continued stagnant consumer confidence, the potential impact of social unrest, and possible further reductions in the oil production platform. Mexican financial markets face two challenges. First, the sharp fall in crude oil prices since last summer has made the country’s fiscal position weaker, since oil still accounts for approximately one-third of budgeted public-sector revenue. In view of the most likely scenario that oil prices remain low for some time to come and the decreasing oil production trend, the federal government recently sent investors a sign of fiscal responsibility by announcing cuts to 2015 budgeted spending, amounting to 0.7 percent of GDP, despite the fact that oil revenue for the year is almost fully hedged.5 Second, the U.S. Fed is widely expected to begin normalizing monetary policy this year. Volatility has hit the Mexican foreign exchange market, with the peso depreciating significantly, along with most other world currencies. However, the adjustment in Mexico has been orderly, with abundant liquidity prevailing in market operations. Furthermore, during 2015, holdings of peso-denominated government bonds by nonresidents have remained stable. While somewhat higher than last year, interest rates continue to be relatively low for all terms. Nevertheless, as U.S. monetary policy normalization is around the 4 See Blue Chip Economic Indicators, March 2015, and Banco de México (2014), Quarterly Report, October-December 2014, Summary, February. 5 See SHCP (2015), “La SHCP Anuncia Medidas de Responsabilidad Fiscal para Mantener la Estabilidad.” Press Release 007/2015, January. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  corner, some portfolio adjustment and further bouts of volatility cannot be ruled out. Therefore, financial authorities must remain on watch. So far in 2015, inflation has returned to a path of convergence with the Bank of Mexico’s 3 percent permanent target, after a year of straying due to temporary factors such as tax hikes and agricultural price pressures. The recent decline in inflation has been supported by the disappearance of the effect from last year’s tax increases and fading pressures from agricultural prices, along with lower key telecoms and electricity prices. The better inflation performance must be maintained. Upside risks include more significant pass-through from a weaker peso down the road, as well as the resurgence of spikes in noncore inflation prices and eventual aggregate demand pressures. Close monitoring of these risks is all-important in view of the fact that analysts’ long-term inflation expectations remain above the 3 percent target. Sustained convergence with the target must be consolidated. Final remarks Mexico is on a path that should help take it to the resolution of fundamental issues obstructing productivity and long-term growth. In particular, recent telecoms and energy reforms seek to foment investment and competition in these sectors, which may boost the efficiency of the economy. The degree of success of these and other reforms should be defined in terms of enhancing the economy’s potential. This will depend heavily on the quality of implementation, in the sense that these reforms actually lead to greater market flexibility and investment, and generate substantially effective competition. Moderate cyclical economic recovery in Mexico is underway on the back of stronger U.S. performance. Persistently lower oil prices and upcoming U.S. monetary policy normalization pose challenges to both Mexico’s economic upturn and markets. Further volatility cannot be excluded, and thus the authorities must remain on alert. Finally, inflation has recently fallen to the Bank of Mexico’s target. However, convergence to this objective must be consolidated so that it becomes a permanent phenomenon. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andrew G Haldane: On microscopes and telescopes Speech by Mr Andrew G Haldane, Executive Director and Chief Economist of the Bank of England, at the Lorentz centre workshop on socio-economic complexity, Leiden, Netherlands, 27 March 2015. *      *      * The views are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee. I would like to thank Thibaud de Barman, Lucy Canham, Chiranjit Chakraborty, Jeremy Franklin, Rashmi Harimohan, John Hill, Bradley Hudd, Ben Kempley, Lu Liu, Katie Low, Anna Jernova, Carsten Jung, Damien Lynch, Yaacov Mutnikas, Tobi Neumann, Paul Robinson and David Ronicle for their assistance in preparing the text. I would also like to thank Stephen Burgess, Oliver Burrows, Pavel Chichkanov, Nicholas Fawcett, Bob Hills, Ronan Hodge, Glenn Hoggarth, Catrin Jones, Vas Madouros and Simon Whitaker for their comments and contributions. Accompanying charts and the table can be found on the Bank of England’s website. At least since the financial crisis, there has been increasing interest in using complexity theory to make sense of the dynamics of economic and financial systems (Newman (2011), Arthur (2014)). Particular attention has focussed on the use of network theory to understand the non-linear behaviour of the financial system in situations of stress (Gai and Kapadia (2011), Haldane and May (2011), Gai, Haldane and Kapadia (2011)). The language of complexity theory – tipping points, feedback, discontinuities, fat tails – has entered the financial and regulatory lexicon. Some progress has also been made in using these models to help design and calibrate post-crisis regulatory policy. As one example, epidemiological models have been used to understand and calibrate regulatory capital standards for the largest, most interconnected banks – the so-called “super-spreaders” (Craig et al (2014)). They have also been used to understand the impact of central clearing of derivatives contracts, instabilities in payments systems and policies which set minimum collateral haircuts on securities financing transactions (Haldane (2009)). Rather less attention so far, however, has been placed on using complexity theory to understand the overall architecture of public policy – how the various pieces of the policy jigsaw fit together as a whole. This is a potentially promising avenue. The financial crisis has led to a fundamental reshaping of the macro-financial policy architecture. In some areas, regulatory foundations have been fortified – for example, in the micro-prudential regulation of individual financial firms. In others, a whole new layer of policy has been added – for example, in macro-prudential regulation to safeguard the financial system as a whole (Hanson, Kashyap and Stein (2010)). This new policy architecture is largely untried, untested and unmodelled. This has spawned a whole raft of new, largely untouched, public policy questions. Why do we need both the micro- and macro-prudential policy layers? How do these regulatory layers interact with each other and with monetary policy? And how do these policies interact at a global level? Answering these questions is a research agenda in its own right. Without answering those questions, I wish to argue that complexity theory might be a useful lens through which to begin exploring them. The architecture of complex systems may be a powerful analytical device for understanding and shaping the new architecture of macro-financial policy. Modern economic and financial systems are not classic complex, adaptive networks. Rather, they are perhaps better characterised as a complex, adaptive “system of systems” (Gorod et al (2014)). In other words, global economic and financial systems comprise a nested set of sub-systems, each one themselves a complex web. Understanding these complex sub-systems, and their interaction, is crucial for effective systemic risk monitoring and management. This “system of systems” perspective is a new way of understanding the multi-layered policy architecture which has emerged since the crisis. Regulating a complex system of systems 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  calls for a multiple set of tools operating at different levels of resolution: on individual entities – the microscopic or micro-prudential layer; on national financial systems and economies – the macroscopic or macro-prudential and monetary policy layer; and on the global financial and economic system – the telescopic or global financial architecture layer. The architecture of a complex system of systems means that policies with varying degrees of magnification are necessary to understand and moderate fluctuations. It also means that taking account of interactions between these layers is important when gauging risk. For example, the crisis laid bare the costs of ignoring systemic risk when setting micro-prudential policy. It also highlighted the costs of ignoring the role of macro-prudential policy in managing these risks. That is why the post-crisis policy architecture has sought to fill these gaps. New institutional means have also been found to improve the integration of these micro-prudential, macro-prudential, macro-economic and global perspectives. In the UK, the first three are now housed under one roof at the Bank of England. In what follows, I first set out some background on the dynamics of a complex system of systems using some stylised examples. I then discuss some stylised facts on the “system of systems” that is today’s economic and financial network. Finally, I draw out some tentative conclusions for future research and policy which follow from viewing the macro-financial system through this lens. The architecture of complexity The literature on complexity theory, and its implication for system dynamics, is now deep and rich (Newman (2011)). Although there is no generally-accepted definition of complexity, the one contained in Herbert Simon’s classic 1962 article on the Architecture of Complexity – “one made up of a large number of parts that interact in a non-simple way” – continues to capture well its everyday essence (Simon (1962)). In complex systems, the whole behaves very differently than the sum of its parts. Although there is no single unifying theory of complexity, the dynamic properties of complex systems are now reasonably well-understood, based on analytical and experimental studies of networks of all types – physical, natural, social, biological and economic (Ladyman et al (2013)). These dynamic properties include non-linearity; discontinuities in responses to shocks; amplifying feedback effects; and so-called “emergent” system-wide behaviour which is difficult to predict from the behaviour of any one element. These properties of complex systems typically give rise to irregular, and often highly non-normal, statistical distributions for these systems over time. This manifests itself as much fatter tails than a normal distribution would suggest. In other words, system-wide interactions and feedbacks generate a much higher probability of catastrophic events than Gaussian distributions would imply (Newman (2005), Gabaix (2009)). They may also result in distributions which are multi-modal, consistent with models of multiple equilibria (Bisin et al (2011)). The topology and wiring of these complex systems appears, perhaps predictably, to have a crucial bearing on their resilience to shocks. Many complex networks have been found, in practice, to exhibit a “scale-free” property (Barabasi and Albert (1999)). That is to say, they comprise a core set of nodes with a large number of connections and a large set of peripheral nodes with few connections. There is a core-periphery, or hub-and-spokes, network configuration. This scale-free property has been found in everything from food webs to the World Wide Web, from eco-systems to economic systems, from synapses to cities, from social networks to financial networks (Jackson (2010)). These scale-free topologies have important, if subtle, implications for system resilience. For example, core-periphery models have been found to be very robust, at a systemic level, to random shocks. That is because these shocks are very likely to fall on peripheral nodes unconnected with, and hence unlikely to cascade through, the system as a whole. But these 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  systems are also vulnerable to targeted attack on the core nodes – the “super-spreaders” – whose hyper-connectivity risks generating a systemic cascade (Albert, Jeong and Barabasi (2000)). Another typical feature of complex systems is that they tend to organise themselves as a hierarchy, with a well-defined structure of systems and sub-systems (Simon (1962, 1976)). Herbert Simon believed hierarchical structures of a particular type were likely to dominate, namely ones which were “decomposable”. By this he meant organisational structures which could be partitioned such that the resilience of the system as a whole was not reliant on any one sub-element.1 For evolutionary reasons of survival of the fittest, Simon posited that decomposable networks were more resilient and hence more likely to proliferate as a species (Simon (1962)).2 While Simon’s evolutionary theory may be a reasonable long-run description of some real-world complex systems – natural and biological – it may be less good as a description of the evolution of socio-economic systems. The efficiency of many of these networks relies on their hyper-connectivity. There are, in the language of economics, significantly increasing returns to scale and scope in a network industry. These returns increase with network connectivity (Goldin and Mariathason (2014)). Think of the benefits of global supply chains and global interbank networks for trade and financial risk-sharing. This provides a powerful secular incentive for non-decomposable socio-economic systems. Moreover, if these hyper-connected networks do face systemic threat, they are often able to adapt in ways which avoids extinction. For example, the risk of social, economic or financial disorder will typically lead to an adaptation of policies to prevent systemic collapse. These adaptive policy responses may preserve otherwise-fragile socio-economic topologies. They may even further encourage the growth of connectivity and complexity of these networks. For example, policies to support “super-spreader” banks in a crisis may encourage them to become larger, and more complex, still over time (Haldane (2009)). The combination of network economies, and policy responses to failure, means socio-economic systems may be less Darwinian, and hence decomposable, than natural and biological systems. It is against this backdrop that a complex, socio-economic “system of systems” may emerge. This can defined as one comprising an interlocking set of individually complex webs ((Gorod et al (2014)). The system of system concept initially emerged for engineering and enterprise systems, which involved the multi-layered assembly of component parts. But it has since found its way into a number of other domains including military planning, ecological evolution, power grids, transport networks and neurological structures (Gao et al (2014)). Although still in its infancy, there are some general properties of a “system of systems” perspective that are worth bringing out. For example, Kurant and Thiran (2006) look at the behaviour of a particular topology – a layered complex network. Specifically, they focus on the behaviour of transport networks with a two-layer structure. Simulations of this network suggest that monitoring risk on a layer-by-layer basis is likely to understate significantly the risk facing each individual layer. Layered complex networks may also be less robust to failure than might be apparent from assessing the resilience of each layer in turn. In other words, the risks in a layered network are strikingly different than the sum of their parts. The greater the complexity of each layer, and the stronger the correlation between layers, the greater is this vulnerability (Kurant and                                                 1  As an example, early TV sets were built in a non-decomposable way, which made them vulnerable to the failure of one element. Later, TV sets, cars and other complex gadgets tend to be constructed in a “decomposable” fashion to improve their resilience. 2  Charles Perrow’s concept of “tightly coupled” – non-decomposable – systems is closely linked (Perrow (1984)). 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Thiran (2006)). In some respects, this is the counterpart of Simon’s “decomposability” hypothesis in a system of systems context. Most recently, research has focussed on the controllability of complex, layered networks (Liu, Slotine and Barabasi (2011), Gao, Liu, D’Souza and Barabasi (2014)). It has tended to find that, even when the dimensionality of a network is large (a large number of layers), effective control can be exercised by acting on a relatively small number of key layers or nodes. This is particularly the case when the network has scale-free properties – in other words, a core-periphery-type topology. These points can be brought to life using some simulations of the statistical distribution of a simple set of systems of systems. These are constructed by mixing together component distributions, which proxy the layers or sub-systems. These layers may themselves be complex. This mixing of layers, or distributions, is done using an assumed distribution of correlations, which may itself be non-normal and complex. In other words, there are multiple layers of complexity in this system of systems. The inputs to the simulations are shown in Table 1. Chart 1 shows a set of joint (system-wide) distributions from these simulations, where each line represents a probability contour of the distribution.3 Chart 1a is the baseline case. It involves a mix of two normal distributions with a low correlation coefficient (0.3) where these correlations are themselves normally distributed.4 This joint distribution represents a two-layer system of systems, with neither layer complex (hence the normal distribution for each) and where the correlation between the sub-systems is weak and regular. The resulting joint distribution is slightly more elliptical than the normal – meaning a greater likelihood of large positive or negative outcomes occurring simultaneously – but is otherwise unexceptional.5 We can now add progressively greater degrees of complexity to this base case to assess its impact on the distribution of systemic risk. Chart 1b raises the correlation between the two layers to 0.8; there is now strong feedback between the sub-systems. It results in a notable elongation of the system-wide distribution and an even greater probability of good or bad news striking simultaneously; it becomes more non-normal, closer to the statistical properties we expect from natural, biological and social networks. If we allow one of the layers of this cake to exhibit the properties of a complex system, by assuming it is t- rather than normally-distributed, then the system-wide distribution is shown in Chart 1c.6 The tails of this distribution have now further widened. And if we allow for a non-normal distribution of correlations between the sub-systems – by assuming correlations rise when there is a bad draw, as during crises – the lower tail is larger still and the mass is skewed downwards (Chart 1d). The final, and perhaps most interesting, case is shown in Chart 1e. This shows a three-layer network. Two of these layers are themselves complex (they are t-distributed) and all of the layers are strongly correlated in the network tree. The resulting system-wide distribution is highly irregular. It is also heavily fat-tailed, meaning that catastrophically good or bad outcomes are now much more probable than the normal distribution would suggest. Its topology is significantly more complex than any of its individual layers. These simulations, although simple, provide some insight into the likely behaviour of a complex system of systems. For example, they suggest that viewing risk through the lens of a single layer is likely to provide a significantly distorted picture of the true risk distribution,                                                 3  Which are based on one million replications of the data generating process. 4  Technically, this is done using the so-called Gaussian copula. 5  With zero correlation between the two distributions, Chart 1a would be a set of concentric circles. 6  The t-distribution has fatter tails than the normal. In the simulations, we assume 5 degrees of freedom. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  with the probability of tail events materially under-estimated. As an example of that, Chart 1f looks at the unconditional and conditional distributions of one of the sub-systems in Chart 1c. The conditional distribution is conditioned on outcomes in the second layer lying in the lower half of the distribution. A risk manager looking at the unconditional distribution (a single layer perspective) would significantly under-estimate the true tail risk they were facing. This has direct parallels with the pre-crisis situation, when the actions of individual risk managers at banks, and individual supervisors of those banks, ignored the role of systemic risk when gauging individual firm risk. This led to a material under-estimation of individual firm risk. The micro-prudential microscope was wrongly focussed. Ignoring a layer, or sub-system, is likely to be equally distorting. That can be seen by comparing the risk distributions in Chart 1d (two layers) and 1e (three layers). If the world involves three layers of complexity, then missing a layer will lead to a significant under-estimation of risk. This, too, has a parallel with the pre-crisis situation where the macro-prudential layer was essentially ignored by both micro-prudential and macro-economic policymakers. This led both to under-estimate the policy risk they faced. Pulling this together, what are the public policy implications which follow from this complex system of systems perspective? First, it underscores the importance of accurate data, and timely mapping, of each layers in a system of systems. This is especially important when these layers are themselves complex. Granular data is needed to capture the interactions within and between these complex sub-systems. Second, modelling of each of these layers, and their interaction with other layers, is likely to be important, both for understanding system risks and dynamics and for calibrating potential policy responses to them. Third, in controlling these risks, something akin to the Tinbergen Rule is likely to apply. There is likely to need to be at least as many policy instruments as there are complex sub-components of a system of systems if risk is to be monitored and managed effectively. Put differently, an under-identified complex system of systems is likely to result in a loss of control, both system-wide and for each of the layers. The architecture of macro-financial systems How, then, does this theory relate to real-world, macro-financial systems? These systems are likely to contain many moving parts. Moreover, these moving parts are likely to be significantly more tightly-coupled than in the past as a result of financial and global integration. In other words, the global economic and financial system may, over recent decades, have become a “system of systems”, with multiple, interacting layers each a complex system in its own right. Chart 2 provides a stylised characterisation of those layers, decomposed four ways. At the highest resolution – the “micro-prudential” layer – are individual financial firms. These are, if you like, the atoms of the financial system. Like atoms, however, some individual banks are themselves complex entities, with many moving and interacting business parts. At one lower level of resolution – the “macro-prudential” layer – is the financial system. This comprises interactions between financial firms in the network, as might arise from counterparty relationships in interbank, repo and derivatives markets. This layer is akin to an organ, like the brain, whose behaviour is the result of interactions between complex neurological sub-components. At a lower level of resolution still – the “macro-economic” layer – is the national economy. This comprises complex interactions between the financial sector and the wider economy – the flows of funds which intermediates money from owners to borrowers. It is akin to the 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  physiology of a human, whose behaviour in the result of complex interactions among its organs, themselves complex sub-components. Finally, at the lowest level of resolution of all – the “telescopic” layer – is the global economic and financial system. This involves cross-border trade and financial interactions between countries, with flows of goods, services or information at increasing volumes and velocities. It is akin to interactions within a social network or across the World Wide Web. At least in principle, each of these individual layers could be complex. These layers are also likely to interact. For example, there are likely to be strong interactions between the financial system and the macro-economy and between individual national financial systems and the global financial system. This coupling between sub-systems adds to the degree of complexity of the system as a whole. Let me present some stylised facts on each of these layers, from microscopic through telescopic, to illustrate why each has the characteristics of a complex sub-component. I will also present some evidence on interactions between these sub-systems, which means we have a genuine macro-financial system of systems. (a) Complexity among individual firms There is no off-the-shelf measure of organisational complexity, whether within banks or more generally, but a number of proxies have recently been constructed. For example, the Basel Committee has recently devised a range of complexity metrics for the world’s so-called SIFIs – systemically important financial institutions.7 So far, 30 institutions globally have been designated by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as SIFIs, from across a range of countries. Chart 3 looks at a set of four complexity proxies for each of the designated SIFIs in 2006, the year before the financial crisis broke: total balance sheet size; the notional value of their derivatives portfolio; the number of legal entities in the group; and their trading assets. They are shown by their country of incorporation. In 2006, the average SIFI had a balance sheet of $1.35 trillion – roughly the same as the annual GDP of a small G7 country. The largest SIFI had a balance sheet totalling $3.0 trillion. This is many multiplies of the largest non-financial firm. It also only covers on-balance sheet positions. Turning to off balance sheet positions, the derivatives portfolio of an average SIFI totalled $19 trillion in notional terms in 2006.8 For the largest SIFI, it was $60 trillion. This, too, is many multiples of the largest non-financial firm’s position. These massive SIFI balance sheets were, in turn, spread across a very large array of distinct legal entities within each group. In 2006, the average SIFI had around 328 legal entities within the group. The largest had almost 900 distinct legal entities. Most of the largest global SIFIs had numbers of legal entities running to four figures. By comparison, the world’s largest non-financial firms had less than half this number of legal affiliates (Carmassi and Herring (2014)). A final complexity metric is the proportion of so-called trading assets. This is a diagnostic on the diversity of a bank’s business model – whether it is engaged in investment as well as commercial banking. Some of these trading assets will also be complex and hence difficult to price and trade – so-called Level 2 and 3 assets. As Chart 3 shows, the average SIFI had a trading book of around a quarter of assets in 2006. For the largest, this was closer to around 50% of assets.                                                 7  See BCBS (2014). 8  Notional exposures are likely to be a poor proxy of the underlying risk on this portfolio, but provide an indication of the scale of gross derivative positions. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Since the crisis, there is little evidence of these complexities having reversed. Chart 4 updates the four metrics using end-2013 data. The balance sheet of the average SIFI has not shrunk. In fact, it had risen to around $1.8 trillion by end-2013. For the largest SIFI, it was around $4.0 trillion. The pattern is even more striking off balance sheet. For the average SIFI, the derivatives book has risen by over 50% to over $30 trillion by 2013. For the largest, it had risen to $75 trillion. On the other complexity metrics, the number of legal entities for the average SIFIs is essentially unchanged comparing 2006 and 2013. And despite a significant rise in risk weights, there had been only a modest slimming of SIFI trading books by 2013, with the average share of assets going from 22% to 19%. An alternative, more micro-economic, approach to gauging organisational complexity is to look at internal structures. For example, Collinson and Jay (2012) use a five-way classification of complexity: governance; internal structures; staff capabilities; roles and responsibilities; and corporate culture. They use this to evaluate the world’s largest 200 companies, including 26 banks. Financial services rank sixth overall as an industry on complexity grounds. Within this, however, there is a striking diversity in performance, with a number of banks standing out as having high levels of complexity and low performance. Chart 5 plots banks’ complexity and performance, based on a study by Simplicity Consulting in 2012.9 It shows an inverted U-shaped pattern. While modest degrees of bank complexity are good for performance, beyond a threshold these complexity benefits go into reverse and performance worsens. This U-shaped pattern is consistent with micro-economic theory. It suggests economies of scale and scope in banking can give way to diseconomies beyond some threshold. There is empirical evidence suggesting diseconomies of scale may operate for some SIFIs, consistent with them being “too complex to manage” (Davies and Tracey (2014)). Taken together, this evidence suggests the world’s SIFIs are, and remain, highly complex entities in their own right. (b) Complexity within the financial system As with individual banks, there are no perfect metrics of financial system complexity. But maps of the topology or wiring of the financial sector can be revealing about the strength, direction and complexity of the counterparty links between, and interactions among, financial firms. As one example, Chart 6 looks at the interbank connections between UK banks in 2013.10 This suggests the wiring of the interbank network is messy and dense. The network’s epicentre is a small set of large banks with a very large number of connections – “super-spreader” banks. There are, in addition, a large number of peripheral banks with few connections. In other words, the interbank system has all the properties of a classic scale-free network. Chart 7 looks at the pattern of interbank funding exposures among UK banks. It, too, suggests a complex web with scale-free properties. Networks with these properties are prone to failures among the super-spreader nodes. Since these are likely to be the entities most exposed to “too complex to manage” problems, this topology harbours a potential systemic vulnerability, the type of which was exposed in 2008.                                                 9  “True Cost of complexity in the banking sector”, Simplicity Consulting (2012). 10  It is taken from Langfield, Liu and Ota (2014). Exposures comprise unsecured loans, marketable securities, CDS sold minus CDS bought, securities lending and repo and derivatives exposures. 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Complex interactions are not confined to the banking sector. The non-bank (“shadow” banking) sector has become increasingly important over recent years. In the US, estimates suggest it was broadly equivalent in scale to banking in the run-up to the crisis. At a global level, non-bank intermediation is currently estimated at around $75 trillion, around half of the assets of the global banking system. Because many of these entities sit outside of the regulatory perimeter, data on their exposures and interactions is thin on the ground. But work in the US to map these interactions suggests they too are dense and complex (Pozsar et al (2010)). Chart 8 presents a stylised map of the shadow banking sector and its interaction with the banking sector. These interactions are highly complex and multi-layered. (c) Complexity of macro-financial interactions The links and interactions between the financial sector and the wider economy are, in some respects, even less well mapped than the shadow banking sector. They, too, have evolved significantly over recent decades in scale and complexity. As an example of that evolution, Chart 9 looks at a representation of the flow of funds between various sectors in the UK – companies, households, the rest of the world and government. It also shows the role of the financial sector in intermediating these flows of funds between ultimate asset-owners (shown at the top) and liability-holders (shown at the bottom). The intermediation sector is further decomposed into banking and “other” financial intermediaries such as pension, hedge and other funds and insurance companies. The Bank of England’s is also shown. These balance sheets are scaled relative to GDP at two dates, 1978 and 2011. The changes over time in the scale and pattern of intermediation are striking. In 1978, the UK banking system was dominated by foreign banks. Banks’ assets summed to a little over 100% of GDP. Non-bank intermediaries, meanwhile, accounted for little more than 50% of GDP and were dominated by traditional real-money investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies. The Bank of England’s balance sheet was a mere 6% of GDP. Fast forwarding to 2011, this flow of funds picture has been transformed. The balance sheets of ultimate asset-owners/liability-holders has risen from around 200% of GDP to around 600% of GDP – a threefold rise. The scale and pattern of intermediation between these sectors has also been transformed. The banking sector has also risen substantially over this period. UK universal banks now dominate the landscape, accounting for 80% of total banking assets. They are the new “super-spreaders” of the UK financial sector. Non-bank intermediation has also seen a dramatic scaling-up of its balance sheets, rising sixfold to 300% of GDP. Within this, growth has been particularly strong within the non-traditional sectors (such as hedge funds and unauthorised funds) and among new types of vehicle (such as ETFs and private equity funds). These are a new strain of potential “super-spreader”. The Bank of England’s balance sheet has also grown rapidly, rising to over 25% of GDP, largely courtesy of QE. Overall, the picture is of a much larger, much more diverse and potentially considerably more complex set of channels of intermediation than in the past. Of course, this stylised map offers only the most cursory of indications of the true degree of complexity in individual interactions within and between sectors. (d) Complexity of global macro-financial interactions A final dimension to network complexity is the global one. There has been a dramatic rise in the scale of global trade and, in particular, capital market integration over the past few decades. Both are now at their highest levels for several centuries and, most probably, ever (Chart 10). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  For global trade, Chart 11 compares trade flows across 70 countries constituting around 80% of world exports at two dates – 1995 and 2013. The size of the nodes reflects the importance of a country to world trade and the thickness of the links the size of trade flows. It is clear that the wiring of the international trading systems has become considerably more dense and complex over this period, reflecting the deepening and lengthening of global value chains (OECD (2013), de Backer and Miroudet (2014)). This highly interconnected and complex set of global supply chains has the potential to propagate disturbances much more virulently than in the past, as two recent events illustrate. The first was the correlated collapse of world trade during the financial crisis. Between 2008Q1 and 2009Q1, real world trade fell by almost 15%. Correlations between regional import volumes rose to close to unity at the height of the crisis (Chart 12). The strength and length of global supply chains caused a synchronous collapse in trade (Bems et al (2012)). The second was the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Because Japan plays a central role in global supply chains as a producer of high-value intermediate goods, this had a cascading effect on global production. For example, as Japanese car producers ceased production, their foreign affiliates were unable to compensate because they depending on inputs from Japan (OECD (2013)). Deepening global supply chains mean a large number of countries are now potential “super-spreaders” of global trade contagion. The story is similar, if on an even more dramatic scale, when it comes to global banking. Chart 13 plots the network of cross-border bank lending flows across a wide range of countries, in 1980 and in 2007. As with trade, the wiring of the international banking network has become significantly more dense and complex (Minoiu and Reyes (2013)).11 And as with domestic banking networks, there is a clear core-periphery pattern to the network, with a small number of nodal “super-spreader” banking sectors serving as international lenders to the periphery banks. The global financial crisis provided a telling illustration of the susceptibility of such a network to a weakening, or failure, of the core banking sector. As these core sectors came under stress, it caused a significant cascading of global interbank contagion. Cross-border inter-bank lending flows fell by around 20% between 2008Q2 and 2010Q2. The largest cross-border banks – the “super-spreaders” – appear to have played a central role in instigating and propagating this global contagion (Hills and Hoggarth (2013)). (e) Correlations among sub-systems Another dimension when gauging risks to the macro-financial system is the correlation between layers of the system. For correlations between individual banks and the financial system as a whole, one metric is provided by looking at the common component within the joint distribution of bank equity prices. For example, the first principal component of UK bank equity prices accounts for around 70% of the overall movement in bank equities. At the time of the financial crisis, this common component rose to nearer 90%. These correlations are high and highly crisis-sensitive, suggesting a close link between individual and systemic bank risk. The picture is similar when looking at correlations between developments in the financial system and the wider economy. For example, the pairwise correlation between the financial and non-financial components of UK equity prices is high, at around 0.8–0.9. The picture is similar if we move from the national to the international level: the first principal component of international equity prices accounts for around 80–90% of the variation. Each of these                                                 11  This analysis uses the Bank for International Settlements bilateral locational statistics. This does not capture flows between periphery countries, so there is a risk that it overstates the importance of the core. See Minoiu and Reyes (2013) for more information 
   10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  correlations is, in their own way, a rather imperfect metric of cross-system interaction. Nonetheless, they suggest these interactions are, in general, both important and strong. A final, indirect and reduced-form, piece of evidence on the complexity of the macro-financial system comes from looking at the statistical distribution of behaviour in these systems. For other complex systems, physical, natural, biological and social systems, this statistical distribution is known to be highly non-normal (Newman (2005)). Indeed, many of these systems are found to be Power-law distributed, with much fatter tails than would be expected from a normal distribution. To what extent are these statistical properties evident in macro-economic and financial time-series data? Chart 14 looks at the statistical distribution of GDP growth, credit growth, equity prices and rice prices, using a long time-series covering several hundreds of year. These densities have been transformed such that, if the underlying distribution is normal, the dots trace a straight line. Any deviation at the extremities is evidence of a fat-tailed distribution. It is clear from Chart 14 that all four series exhibit a significant degree of fat-tailedness, considerably more so than a normal distribution. This is consistent with economic and financial systems, locally and globally, exhibiting complex system of systems properties. For example, a four-standard deviation event – a true catastrophe – would under a normal distribution be expected to occur roughly every 15,000 years. Under the estimated distributions for economic and financial systems, such an event would occur every 10 to 15 years. Implications for policy design So what might this mean for the design of the policy architecture? Let me mention three areas where clear progress has been made since the crisis, but where more may be needed in the period ahead if we are to manage effectively this complex, macro-financial system of systems: data, modelling and policy design. (a) Data Monitoring risk in a system of systems requires data on each of the sub-systems, often at a high level of granularity. Often in response to crisis, efforts have been made over time to improve data on economic and financial systems. For example, there have been successive waves of improvement to statistics on international banking flows, starting in the 1970s. In response to the latest crisis, renewed efforts have been made to fill data gaps and to improve the degree of disclosure by banks of their balance sheet positions (FSB (2012)). As one example, data on banks’ cross-border assets and liabilities only distinguish between banks and non-banks. In practice, a richer sectoral decomposition of these data is often desirable to understand interactions between different parts of the financial sector and between it and the wider economy (Hills and Hoggarth (2013), Lane (2014)). For example, the dollar funding crisis which faced European banks in 2011/12 involved a complex string of cross-border financing. Funds raised in the US from money market funds were round-tripped back into the US through the purchase of asset-backed securities by European banks. When US money funds withdrew their dollar funding, this chain went into reverse gear causing a dollar funding problem. Understanding those links in the cross-border financing chain is impossible without detailed sectoral data. That is now in train. Yet there remain significant data constraints on our ability to map the macro-financial system of systems in the detail necessary to capture accurately interactions within and across sub-systems. Even among the world’s largest banks, data on their bilateral exposures to one another remains partial and patchy, especially for off balance sheet positions and securities holdings. That means large parts of the core of the international banking map remain, essentially, uncharted territory. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  These data gaps are even more acute when moving beyond the banking system. Large parts of the non-bank sector remain in the shadows from a data perspective. For example, reliable measures of the aggregate and/or individual leverage, maturity and foreign currency mismatch positions of non-bank intermediaries – some of the key vulnerability metrics – are thin on the ground. The FSB has an agenda to fill these data gaps. More broadly, flows of funds data, both within the financial sector and between it and the wider economy, domestically and internationally, is at present partial. Chart 15 takes the UK flows of funds map shown earlier and colour codes this according to one measure of its data availability. There remain a number of key areas for improvement, particularly within the non-banks part of the intermediation chain, as well as among companies, households and externally. In response to this, the Bank and the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) have recently initiated a project to improve the UK’s flows of funds data. Although at an early stage, this aims to provide more granular picture of sectoral (“who-to-whom”) flows. Once complete, this should enable interactions between and within the financial and real sectors of the UK economy to be better tracked and modelled. This pattern of data gaps is mirrored globally. Global flow of funds data beyond banking is patchy. Data on flows, and in particular stocks, of cross-border portfolio and foreign direct investment are often low in quality and lack timeliness. For example, official data suggest the UK has a net external liability position of around 20–30% of GDP. But if foreign direct investment stocks are valued at market (rather than book) prices, this switches to a net asset position of around the same amount (Bank of England (2014)). Derivatives positions and net foreign currency positions are also imperfectly captured in global flows of funds data, particularly for companies. For example, over recent years many emerging market companies have borrowed cheaply in dollar-denominated instruments. But gauging the scale of that borrowing, and whether it is hedged either with derivatives or dollar income receipts, is a real data challenge. This is a significant gap because unhedged dollar borrowing is one potential fault-line in the international financial system at present (BIS (2014)). (b) Modelling Once the necessary data is in place, a natural next question is how best to use this to understand the dynamics of the macro-financial system of systems. There are a number of potentially fruitful, if fledgling, avenues of research currently being pursued on that front. In making sense of the macro-financial system, it would be desirable to have a quantitative framework for understanding and evaluating interactions both within the financial system and between it and the wider economy. Pre-crisis, such models were close to non-existent. Indeed, many mainstream macro-economic models did not even contain a well-defined financial sector, much less interactions within it (Roger and Vleck (2011)). The Bank of England was an early pioneer of an approach which placed the financial sector centre-stage, with its so-called RAMSI (Risk Assessment Model of Systemic Institutions) model (Burrows et al (2012)). A stylised overview of RAMSI is given in Chart 16. RAMSI embodies interactions between the elements of individual banks’ balance sheets (the micro-prudential layer), between individual banks (the macro-prudential layer) and between the financial system and the economy (the macro-economic layer). As an example, RAMSI embodies an interbank network which allows counterparty network contagion to propagate. It also contains a behavioural model of funding markets and banks’ liquidity positions which can generate liquidity crisis externalities (Aikman et al (2009)). There are also explicit behavioural links between macro-economic variables and bank balance sheets (through arrears, defaults, losses given default etc). These complex, non-linear 
   12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  channels of risk propagation mean the probability distributions generated from RAMSI are fat-tailed (Chart 17). These ingredients, with rich interactions both within and across banks and between banks and the economy, mean RAMSI is a useful framework when undertaking top-down stress-testing. Alongside bottom-up granular models, the Bank used RAMSI in its concurrent stress-testing of UK banks at the end of last year. Because it can be used to draw probability distributions of bank balance sheet measures, such as liquidity and solvency, in time this may enable probabilistic “fan charts” of bank strength to be constructed. These would be akin to the fan charts for inflation and output produced in the Bank’s Inflation Report for monetary policy purposes. In a broadly similar spirit, but at a greater level of granularity, Agent-Based Models (ABM) are a natural vehicle for modelling behavioural interactions within and across macro-financial systems (Farmer and Foley (2009)). There has been some progress towards developing ABMs, in particular since the financial crisis. For example, the CRISIS (Complexity Research Initiative for Systemic Instabilities) project is a consortium of EU universities, private firms and policymaking institutions which is building large-scale calibrated models to capture sectoral behaviour, including between the economy and the financial system.12 At national level, promising progress has also been made in developing ABM models of the housing market. For example, Geanakoplos et al (2012) develop a regional model of the US housing market, which does a much better job than aggregate macro-economic models in matching housing market patterns, both in in the run-up to, and following, the financial crisis. As part of its new research agenda, the Bank of England is working currently with the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) at Oxford to try and develop an ABM model of the UK housing market.13 As with Geanakoplos et al (2012), the aim is to provide a calibrated, granular model which better captures the dynamics of the housing market. It could also, potentially, be used to help evaluate the efficacy of macro-prudential interventions in that market – for example, policies which alter mortgage loan-to-income or loan-to-value limits. A third promising area of research concerns the interaction the macro-prudential and macro-economic layers of the system – that is, the interplay between macro-prudential and monetary policy tools. This is another priority area for the Bank’s new research agenda. Although these policies have distinct primary objectives, their transmission channels are likely to be closely interwoven, with both affecting risk-taking and economic activity. This adds additional complexity to the setting of monetary and macro-prudential policies. It is possible to explore this complex interplay using simulations from models comprising both nominal and financial frictions. Both are needed to accommodate a role for monetary policy (whose effectiveness relies primarily on nominal frictions) and macro-prudential policies (whose effectiveness relies principally on financial frictions). A number of models have recently been developed with these core ingredients and have been used to explore monetary and macro-prudential policy interactions (Smets (2013), Paustian and De Paoli (2013)). Chart 18 shows the results of a simulation from a model developed by two colleagues at the Bank (Aikman and Nelson (2014)). This, too, embodies both nominal and financial frictions. On the axes are plotted two measures of stability – macro-economic stability (as proxied by the variability of nominal GDP) on the x-axis, financial stability (as proxied by the variance of                                                 12  More details are available at www.crisis-economics.eu. 13  For more on the Bank’s research agenda, please see http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/onebank/discussion.pdf.

If we now allow monetary policy to play an active role in stabilising the business cycle, through an optimal policy rule which weights output and inflation deviations from target, we can move the economy to point B. This is unambiguously preferred to point A, with greater stability in both the financial system and, in particular, the wider economy. But could we do better still by having monetary policy assume explicit responsibility for safeguarding financial stability? If we augment this monetary policy rule to take account of financial stability factors, by having interest rates respond to credit spreads, we move to point C. This has the benefit of improving financial stability relative to the conventional monetary policy case. But this comes at the cost of destabilising somewhat the macro-economy. It is unclear whether point C dominates B in a welfare sense. In other words, having monetary policy meet both macro-economic and macro-prudential objectives involves a trade-off. Once we add an explicit macro-prudential instrument to the equation, however, this trade-off disappears, or at least is lessened. In particular, let’s add a regulatory-set counter-cyclical capital buffer for banks, the like of which is now part of Basel III. Used in tandem with optimal monetary policy, this moves the economy to point D. This involves both greater macro-economic and financial stability than the alternatives. On the face if it at least, it is welfare-improving. Although the model used is specific, the policy lesson appears to be a general one. Having two instruments (monetary and macro-prudential) leads to an improvement in macro-financial stability. Two policy hands beat one when there are two policy objectives. This in a sense underscores the importance of Tinbergen’s augmented policy rule – that there should be as many policy tools as there are complex sub-systems – when managing a complex system of systems. None of the models so far considers global spill-overs, either through trade or financial channels. Generally-speaking, there is a dearth of macro-economic models which take seriously these international spillovers in an analytically-coherent fashion. Even if modelling this behaviour is over-ambitious in the short-term, there may be merit in improved monitoring of these global flows of financing over time, given their importance for the stability of economies and financial systems. Elsewhere, I have likened this to the creation of “global weather map”. This could be used to track and map the source, scale and nature of cross-border capital flows in close to real-time (Haldane (2012, 2014) and IMF (2013)). Plotting this complex, rapidly-adapting web would be a natural precursor to using it to address “what if” questions. What, for example, would be the impact of a rise in US interest rates on the international flow of funds? The IMF would be the natural guardians of this surveillance-cum-stress-testing machine. (c) Policy design Significant changes have been made to the macro-financial policy architecture since the crisis. In general, these frameworks have moved closer towards meeting Tinbergen’s rule of having as many distinct policy tools as there are complex layers in the macro-financial system. These frameworks are now equipped with tools for assessing and addressing risks at a range of resolutions – microscopic, macroscopic and telescopic. And the gaping hole in the pre-crisis policy architecture – the macro-prudential layer – has now been filled. The institutional architecture for macro-financial policy has also been adapted since the crisis to better enable interactions between these policy layers to be addressed. In the UK, the micro-prudential, macro-prudential and monetary policy arms of policy are now attached to a single body, the Bank of England. Each arm has a separate policy committee tasked with 
   14 BIS central bankers’ speeches  setting policy. But these policy committees have shared inputs of information and meet jointly to discuss areas of intersecting policy responsibility (Bank of England (2014)). Taking each of the arms of policy in turn, at the highest level of resolution micro-prudential policy frameworks have been significantly revised in a number of countries since the crisis. Often, this has had the aim of refocussing the microscope on the systemic, as well as firm-specific, risks facing banks. For the world’s largest banks, significant extra cushions of loss-absorbing capacity are now being required, together with changes to banks’ organisational structures to make them credibly resolvable. In some countries, including the UK and US, large banks’ activities are being separated or ring-fenced. These initiatives ought, over time, to lower the degree of complexity and inter-connectivity of these entities, making them less virulent super-spreaders of financial contagion. A second area of progress is stress-testing. A major step forward was taken last year in the concurrent stress-testing of banks across Europe. This followed the successful practice first adopted in the US in 2009. Concurrent stress-testing of the whole banking sector allows both top-down and bottom-up perspectives to be brought to bear when assessing individual firms’ risks. This opens up the possibility of taking seriously complex behavioural interactions, both within the financial sector and between it and the wider economy. For example, a capital-deficient firm might withdraw funding and cause wider liquidity pressures for other banks. Or a sequence of capital-deficient banks might contract lending in a credit crunch, thereby damaging the wider economy and feeding back negatively to other banks’ portfolios (Haldane (2009)). Yet it remains early days in the development of stress-testing technologies. A system of systems perspective could be useful in enabling stress-testing technologies to better capture system-wide risks. For example, interaction and feedback channels could usefully be built into future stress-testing frameworks used by central banks, including the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve and the ECB. At the next level of policy resolution, a key area of progress in the post-crisis period has been in developing the macro-prudential framework and the instruments necessary to execute it (IMF (2013)). Many countries internationally now have a macro-prudential framework in place. And international case law on the efficacy of different macro-prudential tools is being built rapidly (IMF (2013)). Nonetheless, there is much further to go in understanding and calibrating the impact of macro-prudential tools. As well as country case studies, this is likely to draw on models which explore how micro-economic interactions shape macro-economic phenomena. For example, the Bank has recently begun using a Product Sales Database (PSD) compiled by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This covers almost all UK mortgage transaction since 2006, containing around 13 million transactions. This large micro database can be used both to understand the dynamics of the UK housing market and to help calibrate macro-prudential interventions to shape it. For example, Chart 19 shows the regional distribution of loans made at a loan-to-income multiple in excess of 4.5 at two dates – 2009Q1 and 2014Q2. Cooler colours signify a smaller proportion of loans. As can be seen, there was a discernible warming in the UK housing market up to 2014, at least for higher loan-to-income loans. At around this time, the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) made a macro-prudential intervention, constraining to 15% the proportion of mortgages with a loan-to-income multiple in excess of 4.5. This was the first time such a macro-prudential measure had been taken in the UK, though a number of other countries have capped mortgage loan-to-income or loan-to-value multiples (IMF (2013)). This was not, however, a step into the dark for the FPC. The calibration of its intervention drew explicitly on the micro-evidence contained in the PSD database. This gave a very clear 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 15  idea of how many households and banks might be affected by such an intervention and by how much. This was a macro-prudential policy calibrated from micro-prudential constituents. Although a first step, there is clearly further to go in using micro-level data to calibrate the impact of macro-prudential tools on lender and borrower behaviour. Turning to the global economic and financial system, it is here where the existing policy architecture may at present be most deficient. Some have gone further and argued that there is nothing at present that much resembles a global financial architecture at all (de Larosiere (2014), Haldane (2014)). Despite the crisis being the first truly global one, reform of the global financial architecture has been slow. There are many dimensions to reform of the global financial architecture. These include the appropriate role and resourcing of the IMF, the reserve currency role of the dollar and the appropriate role of so-called for capital flow management policies to modulate fluctuations in the global flow of funds (IMF (2012)). Each of these has been widely discussed and debated over many decades. On some issues, there has been progress. For example, the IMF now endorses the use of capital flow management policies in some situations, in contrast to its position a few years ago. But there is one area where progress in strengthening the international financial architecture has been much slower. This is how best to deal with common shocks to global safe and risky yields. One striking feature of the past few years has been the extremely high correlation among asset prices globally, in particular among advanced economies. This is true of both “safe” rates of return on government assets and “risky” rates of return on private assets (Chart 20). In either case, correlations are extremely high, hovering around 0.9. This begs a number of questions, both research and policy. What is the root cause of these correlations? One possibility is portfolio shifts by global asset managers, allocating their portfolio on an asset-by-asset basis. If so, what implications does this carry for national monetary and macro-prudential policymakers, seeking to steer safe and risky rates respectively? Do high global correlations strengthen the case for international co-ordination of monetary and macro-prudential policies? There may be greater scope to co-ordinate macro-prudential tools. One way of doing so is to develop macro-prudential instruments which operate on an asset-class basis, rather than on a national basis. This would be recognition that asset characteristics, rather than national characteristics, may be the key determinant of portfolio choices and asset price movements, perhaps reflecting the rising role of global asset managers. There has already been some international progress towards developing asset market specific macro-prudential tools, specifically in the context of securities financing transactions where minimum collateral requirements have been agreed internationally (FSB (2014)). But there may be scope to widen and deepen the set of financial instruments covered by prudential requirements, to give a richer array of internationally-oriented macro-prudential tools. These would then be better able to lean against global fluctuations in a wider set of asset markets. Conclusion This time was different: never before has the world suffered a genuinely global financial crisis, with every country on the planet falling off the same cliff-edge at the same time. This fall laid bare the inadequacy of our pre-crisis understanding of the complexities of the financial system and its interaction with the wider economy, locally but in particular globally. It demonstrated why the global macro-financial network is not just a complex adaptive system, but a complex system of systems. The crisis also revealed gaps and inadequacies in our existing policy frameworks. Many of those gaps have since been filled. Micro-prudential microscopes have had their lens refocused. Macro-prudential macroscopes have been (re)invented. And global telescopes 
   16 BIS central bankers’ speeches  have been strengthened and lengthened. Institutional arrangements have also been adapted, better enabling co-ordination between the micro, macro and global arms of policy. So far, so good. Clearly, however, this remains unfinished business. The data necessary to understand and model a macro-financial system of systems is still patchy. The models necessary to make behavioural sense of these complexities remain fledgling. And the policy frameworks necessary to defuse these evolving risks are still embryonic. More will need to be done – both research and policy-wise – to prevent next time being the same.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Øystein Olsen: Oil and the Norwegian economy – the challenges ahead Speech by Mr Øystein Olsen, Governor of the Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at a lunch hosted by Danske Bank Markets, New York City, 27 March 2015. *      *      * Accompanying slides can be found on the Norges Bank’s website: Slides (PDF). It’s a great pleasure to be in New York City again and an honour to be invited to give a lunch presentation here today. As Norges Bank, a week ago, published its latest monetary policy report, the economic outlook and the considerations behind the interest rate decision naturally warrant some attention in my speech today. First, however, I would like to give some background information on the economic policy framework in Norway, focusing on the sovereign wealth fund – the Government Pension Fund Global – the fiscal rule and Norges Bank’s foreign exchange transfers to the fund. Norway is a small, open, natural resource-rich economy. About a quarter of our GDP is related to oil and gas extraction, and a large share of our petroleum production is exported. The oil and gas industry has played a vital role for the strong growth in our economy over the past 40 years. When the first oil was brought to the surface in 1971, GDP per capita in Norway was lower than the average for a western economy. The picture has reversed since then. We have gradually caught up to the wealthiest nations. Measured by GDP per capita, Norway now ranks close to the top. Even if we disregard the oil sector’s contribution to growth for a moment, Norway’s mainland economy has shown relatively robust developments. The ripple effects from activities on the continental shelf to the wider economy have been wide-ranging. A growing number of firms have targeted the oil industry. A state-of-the-art oil service industry has emerged. For many firms, the contracts on the Norwegian continental shelf have been a springboard to new export markets. Although Norway’s oil age began 40 years ago, the past 15 years stand out. From the end of the 1990s to 2013, the price of North Sea oil rose from about USD 10 to over USD 100 per barrel. High oil prices and a profitable petroleum production industry have been accompanied by record-high oil investment in recent years. Increased spending of petroleum revenues over the fiscal budget has provided a growth impetus to domestic demand. Employment has remained high and unemployment low for many years, even when the financial crisis hit in 2008. It was made clear at an early stage that Norway’s oil and gas resources belong to the Norwegian people and should be managed on their behalf. The tax system for private and state-owned oil companies and framework conditions for the petroleum industry were designed so that the bulk of the large resource rents generated by the industry would accrue to the Norwegian state. We have avoided making public sector budgets dependent on volatile income. This has mainly been achieved by establishing the sovereign wealth fund and a fiscal rule imposing a constraint on oil revenue spending. The Norwegian parliament passed the Act relating to the fund in 1990. Under the Act, the net budget surplus, including oil revenues, is transferred to the fund, and invested in international markets. The policy guidelines were clarified in 2001 through the introduction of the fiscal rule. Under these guidelines, government spending of oil revenues – measured by the non-oil budget 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  deficit – is limited to the expected real return on the fund – estimated at 4 percent annually. The idea is to leave the capital in the fund untouched, saving it for future generations. The fiscal rule provided for a gradual phasing in of oil revenues. Over time, we would have to expect the real krone exchange rate to appreciate as a result. However, due to the fund mechanism and the fiscal rule, actual spending is decoupled from current petroleum revenues. This has curbed the appreciation of the krone and thus reduced fluctuations in the exchange rate. Compared to other resource-based economies, the real krone exchange rate has remained relatively stable, especially during the period of substantial increases in oil prices (cf. diagram). Let me elaborate on the transactions that actually take place. All revenues from the sale of oil and gas are originally in foreign currency. The oil companies convert some of their foreign exchange revenues to kroner in order to pay taxes and dividends to the government. In addition to tax and dividend revenues in kroner, the government has large revenues in foreign currency from its ownership shares in petroleum fields on the Norwegian continental shelf.1 As long as government revenues in kroner from the petroleum sector exceed annual petroleum revenue spending over the budget, the government is left with a surplus of kroner. This was the situation up until 2014. Norges Bank converted this surplus into foreign currency, which was in turn transferred to the fund. The amount of kroner converted into foreign exchange partly offset the amount of kroner previously bought by the oil companies. Consequently, these operations should not have any impact on the real exchange rate. In 2015, government spending of petroleum revenues over the budget is estimated to be higher than the revenues received in kroner. Government petroleum revenue spending over the budget has increased over time, in pace with the increasing size of the fund. And recently, the government’s net cash flow from the petroleum sector started to decline. As a consequence, Norges Bank will move from a position of selling surplus kroner to selling foreign currency in order to finance petroleum revenue spending. However, the effect on the real exchange rate will still be determined by the amount of petroleum revenues spent over the fiscal budget. It is not Norges Bank’s intention to influence the krone exchange rate through these foreign exchange transactions. Accordingly, purchases are distributed evenly through the year. At the end of each month, Norges Bank announces the size of the daily purchases or sales of kroner for the coming month, based on estimates of oil revenues and fiscal spending. The amount can be interpreted as our best estimate for the remaining months of the year. The economic outlook Let me now turn to the outlook for the Norwegian economy. We are about to leave behind us 15 golden years. The Norwegian economy has made use of favourable tailwinds and seized the opportunities offered. The other side of the coin is an economy that has become increasingly dependent on oil, and thereby more vulnerable to changes in oil prices and petroleum revenues. And as we know, oil prices have fallen by nearly 50 percent since last summer. The vulnerability manifests itself in several ways. A large share of the business sector and the labour market is linked to the petroleum sector in Norway and in other countries.                                                 1  Revenues received from the State’s Direct Financial Interest in the petroleum sector (SDFI). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Petroleum investment, which has long been an important driver of growth in the Norwegian economy, is now expected to fall in the years ahead. The fall in oil prices in recent months has accelerated and amplified an announced decline in the activity level on the Norwegian continental shelf. Lower oil prices reduce oil company cash flows and reduce the profitability of new investments. Field development projects that are now underway will be affected, although to a limited extent. In addition, some new projects may be postponed or cancelled. Lower demand for goods and services from the petroleum sector has spillover effects on the mainland economy, with a dampening effect on labour demand. The fact that activity in the petroleum sector is declining does not mean that the oil age is coming to an end. Nearly half of known oil and gas reserves on the Norwegian continental shelf have not yet been extracted. And large new discoveries have been made over the past few years. Nonetheless, the Norwegian economy must adapt to considerably lower demand from the oil sector. We will be more dependent on growth in other sectors to support growth in the economy. Another challenge is Norway’s high labour costs. The cost level in the business sector has increased sharply relative to our trading partners. To underpin a necessary transition towards non-oil industries, the cost level in Norway must again be brought more closely into line with that of our trading partners. A necessary adjustment of the cost level in Norway can occur by means of lower wage growth in Norway than in other countries or a depreciation of the krone exchange rate. In Norway, monetary policy is geared towards keeping inflation low and stable. The operational target of monetary policy is consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 percent over time. The inflation target provides the economy with a nominal anchor. When inflation expectations are firmly anchored, monetary policy serves as the first line of defence when the economy turns down. Over time, monetary policy can only influence inflation. Monetary policy cannot take primary responsibility for delivering the necessary structural changes in the Norwegian economy. But monetary policy can help facilitate the necessary restructuring process via the exchange rate channel. As long as there is confidence that inflation will remain low and stable over time, a pronounced depreciation of the krone can go hand in hand with a low key policy rate. The krone has depreciated markedly since last September and is now about 10 percent weaker than the average for the first half of 2014. Developments in the krone exchange rate must be seen in the context of lower oil prices and weaker growth prospects for the Norwegian economy. The depreciation of the krone underpins inflation and softens the impact of lower oil prices on the Norwegian economy. As seen in the diagram a weaker krone boosts competitiveness for Norwegian firms facing competition from abroad. At the same time, wage growth has moderated to some extent. There are prospects that real wage growth this year will be at its lowest for nearly 20 years. With improved competitiveness, export firms are in a better position to maintain market shares. As growth picks up abroad, demand for Norwegian goods and services may also increase. At the same time, petroleum-related exports, which account for about a quarter of mainland exports, will likely decrease due to a decline in global offshore investment. It will likely take time for the effects of lower oil prices on the mainland economy to become fully visible. So far, unemployment has only shown a slight increase. A flexible labour market appears to be curbing the rise in unemployment. Employment growth has also remained firm, although an increasing mismatch between the number of unemployed and job vacancies points towards more slack in the labour market. In regions and sectors closely linked to the petroleum sector, unemployment has increased. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Weaker growth prospects may reduce the willingness of mainland firms to invest. On the other hand, improved competitiveness will provide a basis for expanding capacity in some sectors. In addition, housing investment is likely to support overall investment activity. House price inflation remains high. Growth in household consumption has been moderate in recent years and household saving has reached a high level, in spite of low interest rates. The pension reform and uncertainty surrounding economic developments have probably induced households to increase saving. Overall, we expect growth in private consumption to remain moderate ahead and the saving ratio to remain at a high level. Debt-to-income ratios for Norwegian households are high, reflecting a long period of rapidly rising house prices. Low interest rates on loans to households are expected to fuel house price inflation, while prospects for weaker income growth and somewhat higher unemployment may have a dampening impact further ahead. For some time, based on experience from the recent financial crisis, financial stability considerations have to some extent influenced monetary policy. Put in other words: we have been “leaning against the wind”. As a small open economy, Norway is highly influenced by economic developments abroad. Many advanced economies have experienced a difficult time since the global economy was severely hit by the financial crisis. Global growth is expected to pick up. The fall in oil prices is a positive factor for the world economy. But the picture is mixed. In the US, the recovery seems to be on a firm footing. Developments in the UK and Sweden, two of Norway’s major export markets, have also been positive, although inflation remains a challenge. The situation in the euro area appears to be more problematic. A large portion of the workforce is unemployed and production equipment stands idle. Inflation is worryingly low. Through winter, a number of central banks have undertaken unconventional monetary policy easing, and market expectations with regard to key rates in trading partner countries have fallen further. Low interest rates abroad influence the krone and thereby the prospects for inflation, contributing to low interest rates also in Norway. In December last year, Norges Bank cut the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25 percent. In our assessment, Norges Bank gave weight to the weakening of the growth outlook for the Norwegian economy and attached importance to countering the risk of a pronounced downturn due to lower oil prices. Last week, Norges Bank presented its latest Monetary Policy Report with updated projections for developments in the Norwegian economy and a new assessment of the orientation of monetary policy. Developments in the Norwegian economy this winter have been broadly in line with expectations. Inflation remains close to 2.5 percent and unemployment has remained stable. So far, the effects of the fall in oil prices on the real economy have been relatively small. However, the outlook for the Norwegian economy has weakened somewhat. Oil prices have continued to fall and activity in the petroleum industry appears to be declining more than previously assumed. Wage growth in 2014 was lower than projected and there are prospects that wage growth will also be lower ahead than projected earlier. This will lead to lower inflation further ahead. At the same time, house prices continue to rise rapidly. This may increase household vulnerability and may trigger or amplify an economic downturn further ahead. The Executive Board decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.25 percent. If developments in the economy ahead prove to be broadly as projected, there are prospects that the key policy rate will be lowered. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The analysis in the Report suggests a key policy rate of approximately 1 percent in the coming years, followed by a gradual increase. The analysis suggests that inflation will increase somewhat in the coming quarters before edging down and lie slightly above 2 percent later in the projection period. Capacity utilisation in the mainland economy is projected to decline further, before returning to a more normal level. Let me summarise. After the global financial crisis, the Norwegian economy quickly rebounded, supported by robust public finances and strong growth in the petroleum sector. Since last summer, oil prices have fallen. Activity in the petroleum sector has probably passed the peak. So far, the impact on the real economy has been modest. At the same time, the Norwegian economy is facing new challenges. Vulnerabilities established during the golden years must be addressed. From being in a unique economic position, Norway is now headed for a period of restructuring. Norway’s starting point is favourable. Inflation is well anchored and the krone is functioning as a stabiliser. In addition, we have been able to transform oil in the ground into financial wealth in a period when oil prices were high. We have significant fiscal leeway. But the conditions and forces necessary for growth in the economy in the longer run will have to be brought more into line with those of other countries. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stanley Fischer: The importance of the nonbank financial sector Speech by Mr Stanley Fischer, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the “Debt and Financial Stability – Regulatory Challenges” conference, organized by the Bundesbank and the German Ministry of Finance, Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2015. *      *      * It is a pleasure to be here. My subject is the important role the nonbank financial sector plays in the United States financial system. As you know, the euro area financial system differs from the U.S. system in terms of the relative size and the role played by banks as compared with nonbank financial institutions. According to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund, banks in the euro area accounted for roughly 75 percent of total lending by banks and nonbanks that are part of the shadow banking system, whereas in the United States, banks accounted for just under half this measure of total lending in 2013.1 The relatively large role played by nonbank financial institutions in the United States brings with it both economic benefits and risks to financial stability – risks that could be seen clearly during the Global Financial Crisis. The nonbank sector in the United States was not always so large. The U.S. financial system has changed significantly in recent decades, with nonbanks as a whole gaining share and also becoming more interlinked with banks. This evolution has produced material benefits: increased market liquidity, greater diversity of funding sources, and – it is often claimed – a more efficient allocation of risk among investors. However, the evolution has also increased threats to the stability of the overall financial system, as demonstrated by the recent financial crisis. To promote financial stability, our tools for monitoring, regulation, and crisis management have had to evolve in recent years, and they will need to continue to evolve in the years to come. Today I will describe how nonbank intermediation in the United States has changed, what regulations are in place, and what reforms are under way to address the risks to financial stability associated with the growth of the nonbank sector. The lessons we have learned about the U.S. nonbank financial sector may be of interest to regulators in other countries who are promoting or reacting to the changing composition of financing – away from banks and toward nonbanks and market-based intermediation. The role of nonbank financial intermediation in the U.S. financial system I apologize for starting by reminding us of material we all know. First, the provision of credit to nonfinancial businesses and households is critical to a well-functioning economy. Indeed, Ben Bernanke’s research on the Great Depression came to the conclusion that it was the collapse of credit growth, rather than the slow growth of the money supply, that was primarily responsible for the financial crisis of the 1930s. Second, the basic business model of a bank is straightforward: Banks take deposits from their customers and invest the proceeds in the economy via loans to businesses, households, and governments. Therefore, a bank’s balance sheet typically has shorter-term, highly liquid deposits on the liability side and longer-term, illiquid loans on the asset side. This maturity transformation makes banks vulnerable to runs. In recognition of this                                                 1  Note that not all nonbank financial institutions are included in the International Monetary Fund definition of shadow banks. In particular, insurance companies and pension funds are excluded. See International Monetary Fund (2014), Global Financial Stability Report: Risk Taking, Liquidity, and Shadow Banking – Curbing Excess while Promoting Growth (PDF) (Washington: IMF, October) p. 67. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  vulnerability, bank deposits became insured and the lender of last resort function was extended to dealing with bank runs. Third, nonbank financial institutions also act as intermediaries. Their importance as lenders has increased dramatically over the past 35 years. Data from the Financial Accounts of the United States indicate that in 1980, banks accounted for about 60 percent of total credit market assets held by the domestic financial sector, while nonbanks held about 40 percent.2, 3 Certain nonbank financial institutions have long been important credit providers; for example, in 1980, life insurance companies were vital to corporate bond and commercial real estate markets, accounting for about one-third of the debt outstanding in those two markets combined. While insurance companies remained important, other types of nonbank financial institutions, such as GSEs (government-sponsored enterprises, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) and mutual funds, rose in prominence over the next few decades, so that total credit market lending by nonbanks greatly outpaced lending by banks over the 1980s and into the 1990s. By the late 1990s, nonbanks held around two-thirds of total credit market assets held by banks and nonbanks. Their share has stayed relatively stable since then. The nonbank financial system includes a diverse group of entities such as insurance companies, finance companies, government-sponsored enterprises, hedge funds, security brokers and dealers, issuers of asset-backed securities, mutual funds, and money market funds. They provide credit through markets – for example, by purchasing commercial paper and bonds – or by extending loans directly to businesses and to households. These financial institutions evolved alongside banks, and their activities are in many respects intertwined with those of banks. Indeed, for every activity conducted by banks – with the exception of taking government-insured deposits – a nonbank financial institution likely conducts a similar activity. In many cases, nonbanks engage in maturity and liquidity transformation and are levered, so they have vulnerabilities similar to those of banks, but lack the benefit of access to a lender of last resort. While banks may be more central to the payment system, nonbanks are also involved. Moreover, banks and nonbanks are interconnected in many ways – for example, through derivatives, lines of credit, and other services provided by banks to nonbanks – and many markets depend on banks that act as dealers or that provide other services. In addition, many nonbanks are owned by bank holding companies, which may provide capital and liquidity guarantees to nonbank subsidiaries. Not surprisingly, the growth of the nonbank sector has tended to increase the complexity of the financial system. When banks provide loans directly to households and businesses, the chain of intermediation is relatively short and simple. With the growth of nonbank lending, intermediation chains have lengthened, often involving both banks and other nonbank                                                 2  Credit market assets include commercial paper, Treasury securities, agency and GSE-backed securities, municipal securities, corporate and foreign bonds, consumer credit, mortgages, and other types of loans (issued by depository institutions) as well as other loans and advances. Banks and nonbanks held $37.9 trillion of credit market assets in 2014, with nonbanks holding $25.1 trillion and banks holding $12.8 trillion. For more information, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), Statistical Release Z.1, “Financial Accounts of the United States“ (March 12). 3  The domestic financial sector is defined here as domestic banks and nonbank financial institutions, excluding the monetary authority. Banks include U.S.-chartered depository institutions, foreign banking offices in the United States, banks in U.S.-affiliated areas, credit unions, and holding companies. Nonbanks include property and casualty insurance companies, life insurance companies, private pension funds, federal government retirement funds, state and local government retirement funds, money market mutual funds, mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, government sponsored enterprises (GSE), agency- and GSE-backed mortgage pools, issuers of asset-backed securities, finance companies, real estate investment trusts, security brokers and dealers, and funding corporations. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  financial institutions. For example, in the old days, a bank would originate a mortgage and hold it in its portfolio. Today, a bank might originate the same mortgage, but instead of holding that loan on its balance sheet, it could securitize it – in effect, sell it – and the resulting security might be purchased with the help of short-term funding provided by a money market mutual fund. And the process might not end there: Next that mortgage-backed security might be sold and repackaged into several new securities, and so on. In such examples, the number of institutions that might be involved in the provision of a single mortgage credit can easily go from one (the originating bank) to at least five or more. And such long chains can create additional points of vulnerability in the financial system. Nonbanks also increase the amount of maturity transformation conducted in the financial system without the stability-enhancing backstops offered to banks. Although some nonbanks are eligible to obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank System, nonbanks are not backed by federal deposit insurance, nor do they have direct access to a lender of last resort to stem runs on their short-term liabilities. As a result, their funding can dry up rapidly should counterparties begin to believe the nonbank is in financial distress. The failure of nonbank financial institutions could directly reduce the availability of credit and could cause fire sales of assets leading to impaired market functioning. In addition, because many nonbanks are connected to banks, a shock to the nonbank sector could in turn threaten the stability of the overall banking system – as happened in the unfolding of the Global Financial Crisis. Nonbanks and the start of the global financial crisis Before discussing the role of non-banks in the Global Financial Crisis, let me briefly mention a previous episode involving a non-bank – the failure of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). The New York Fed, under the leadership of then President William McDonough, dealt successfully with the LTCM problem. However the episode was scary and a warning about problems that could arise in the nonbank financial system and spread wider. Now to the Global Financial Crisis: Although there were many dimensions to the financial crisis, the poor performance of subprime mortgages was one of the triggers. The fact that losses in what was a relatively small part of the mortgage market quickly spread through the rest of the financial system illustrates how the complex interconnections among banks and nonbanks can amplify shocks in significant and unanticipated ways. Some of the first cracks in the nonbank sector appeared in April 2007, when New Century Financial Corporation, at one point the second-biggest subprime mortgage lender, filed for bankruptcy after its creditors pulled back on fears about its losses.4 A few months later, with subprime assets falling in value, money market investors refused to roll over the asset-backed commercial paper that had been funding many of these subprime assets. With this market shrinking dramatically, the banking sector was left on the hook to support entities that banks had sponsored or to which they had provided some form of credit or liquidity support. Around that same time, Bear Stearns, then one of the five largest investment banks, liquidated two of its hedge funds that invested in mortgage-based securities, including collateralized debt obligations, another link in the chain of transactions. In March 2008, some creditors stopped funding Bear Stearns, and forced asset sales put additional downward pressure on asset prices. By the dramatic month of September 2008, the chain of interconnections had helped spread the financial pain, and a broader range of firms were caught in the financial maelstrom.                                                 4  New Century Financial Corporation was not the first failure linked to the subprime crisis, but it is one of the first large failures. For example, Ownit Mortgage Solutions, a California-based home lender partly owned by Merrill Lynch & Co., failed in December 2006. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship. Lehman Brothers failed when its creditors ran from it as they had from Bear Stearns. American International Group, or AIG, had to be bailed out primarily because of its inability to post enough collateral to cover liabilities on credit protection it had sold on many entities (including Lehman) and because it lost funding in the securities lending market. The Reserve Primary fund, a money market mutual fund, “broke the buck” as a result of its holdings of Lehman securities. Banks were not immune to the financial market stress of this period, but they were far less involved in the unfolding of the crisis than were nonbanks – a phenomenon that highlighted the importance of the nonbank sector and the vulnerability of the financial system to its distress. When nonbanks pulled back, other parts of the system suffered. When nonbanks failed, other parts of the system failed. Regulatory reforms implemented in the wake of the financial crisis A crisis as deep as the Global Financial Crisis was bound to produce widespread regulatory changes. It was clearly necessary to strengthen the banking system and to better analyze and understand the importance of the links between the banking sector and the nonbank financial sector. With respect to the nonbank financial sector, there was a clear need for greater transparency, less leverage, and more stable forms of liquidity transformation. One important change to the banking sector was the adoption of a macroprudential perspective to supervision and regulation.5 Central bankers and bank supervisors in the United States now regulate and supervise large complex banks not only as standalone entities, but also with consideration of how their actions could affect other firms and activities in a highly connected financial system. Within the Federal Reserve, a tangible manifestation of this macroprudential approach is the LISCC – the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee – that was created specifically to coordinate the supervision of the largest banks and other systemically important institutions.6  Other changes to the banking system in the United States include tighter than Basel III capital and liquidity requirements, heightened prudential standards for the largest banking firms, and stress tests. Accounting standards and prudential regulations have also been changed to require banks to recognize their links to nonbank entities, such as direct connections or provision of back-up support. Heightened prudential standards require the largest and most interconnected banks to meet capital surcharges and stricter risk-management standards than other banks. Stress tests evaluate banks’ ability to remain solvent and liquid when under severe macroeconomic stresses and have incentivized better risk-management and information systems within banks. A variety of reforms have helped address risks in the nonbank sector as well. I will touch briefly on three of those reforms. First, the United States has an unusually large number of independent financial sector regulatory bodies. There is accordingly an especially great need for efficient cooperation and coordination among the various regulators that collectively oversee the financial system. In response to this need, the Dodd Frank Act created the                                                 5  There appear to be two meanings of the word “macroprudential.” At first, it referred to a focus on systemic interactions within the financial system. It is in that sense that we are talking at this point. The second meaning is almost the opposite: It relates to regulatory but not monetary policy measures focused on some aspect of the financial system whose behavior is giving cause for concern. 6  The large firms whose supervision is coordinated by the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) are American International Group, Inc.; Bank of America Corporation; The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation; Barclays PLC; Citigroup Inc.; Credit Suisse Group AG; Deutsche Bank AG; General Electric Capital Corporation; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; JP Morgan Chase & Co.; MetLife, Inc.; Morgan Stanley; Prudential Financial, Inc.; State Street Corporation; UBS AG; and Wells Fargo & Company. For more information, see the LISCC webpage on the Board’s website. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to help identify emerging risks and vulnerabilities to financial stability. The council’s annual report on financial stability highlights risks and vulnerabilities for the entire financial system and reflects the council’s own diverse nature: Only 3 of the 10 voting members of the council are banking sector supervisors, with the remainder supervising or having regulatory authority related to credit unions, broker-dealers, asset managers, and derivative market participants. Among its decisions, the FSOC has designated four U.S. nonbank financial institutions as systemically important financial institutions, which makes them subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.7 In addition, the Dodd Frank Act mandated the establishment of the Office of Financial Research in order to help promote financial stability through the measurement and analysis of risks, the conduct of essential research, and the collection and standardization of financial data. A second nonbank reform has been the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) adoption of new rules for money market mutual funds. Specifically, the SEC will require prime money market funds sold to institutional investors to publish a floating net asset value and to restrict withdrawals through a system of gates and fees. These rules, while as yet untested, are designed to reduce the likelihood of runs on prime money market funds. The third nonbank reform I want to highlight relates to securitization, which I mentioned earlier as one way in which parts of the financial system can become interconnected. An important rule, finalized late last year, will require the securitizers of some assets to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets that collateralize the securities.8 With “skin in the game,” the incentive to cut corners in extending loans is reduced, and the entire chain created when assets are securitized should be stronger. Transparency has also been enhanced with stronger disclosure requirements for securitizations. At this stage of the recovery, there are signs of reduced nonbank financial sector vulnerabilities. Leverage is quite low in parts of the sector and appears moderate overall. Leverage at hedge funds, while difficult to measure, is an exception and appears in aggregate to have trended upward in recent years. Market-level information on short-term wholesale funding – such as commercial paper and repurchase agreements – indicate subdued activity after its level fell dramatically during the crisis. While issuance of securitizations has been picking up, its levels remains moderate. The available data paint a picture of a nonbank sector that has generally reduced its vulnerability to the types of shocks that we saw during the crisis. However, the nonbank sector is evolving in response to new regulations, changes in investor preferences, and a multitude of other factors that are always influencing the financial system. For example, open-end mutual funds now hold a greater share of debt, and more derivatives are being                                                 7  The four nonbank institutions that have been designated by the FSOC are MetLife, Inc.; American International Group, Inc.; General Electric Capital Corporation, Inc.; and Prudential Financial, Inc. For more information and to access the FSOC annual report, see the FSOC’s webpage on the U.S. Treasury’s website. 8  In October 2014, six federal agencies – the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission – approved a final rule requiring sponsors of securitization transactions to retain risk in those transactions. The final rule generally requires sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the final rule defines a “qualified residential mortgage” (QRM) and exempts securitizations of QRMs from the risk retention requirement. The final rule aligns the QRM definition with that of a qualified mortgage as defined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The final rule also does not require any retention for securitizations of commercial loans, commercial mortgages, or automobile loans that meet specific standards for high quality underwriting. For more information, see the press release on the Board’s website.

These developments may ultimately prove to be stability enhancing, but as the system evolves, we must remain attentive to the possibility of changes that may be destabilizing. More Needs to Be Done To say that the nonbank sector today appears less vulnerable than it did during the Global Financial Crisis, is not to say that authorities in the United States have tamed the nonbank sector. Indeed, while progress has been substantial, areas for continued work remain, and I will briefly highlight three of them. Let me start with short-term wholesale funding markets. While there have been some improvements in the plumbing of money markets, many nonbank financial firms, including hedge funds and broker-dealers, continue to rely on secured short-term funding to finance their activities, many of which involve longer-term and illiquid assets. This maturity transformation remains a key vulnerability. Further, many of the firms that rely on this maturity transformation are highly levered and thus more vulnerable to threats to their solvency. The proposed international framework being developed by the Financial Stability Board for margins on securities financing transactions may be an important tool for limiting the pro-cyclicality and sharp deleveraging that can occur in these markets. Second, and more generally, we need to be alert to changes and trends in the financial system that may pose risks to financial stability, particularly those stemming from areas of the nonbank sector that are not subject to prudential supervision. For example, the asset management industry has both grown and evolved in recent years. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track the returns of indexes of relatively illiquid assets have mushroomed in size. Examples include funds tracking the return on leveraged loans, credit default swaps, and other less liquid assets. These funds offer daily or even intraday liquidity to investors while holding assets that are hard to sell immediately, thus making the funds vulnerable to liquidity risk. Recently, the FSOC issued a notice seeking comment on the products and activities of the asset management industry. Third, there are also areas of the nonbank financial system into which we have only a limited view. While the data we have on hedge funds has improved, we still need to get a complete picture of the scope and size of hedge fund activities. Data coverage of the vast derivatives market could also be improved. The paucity of information in some areas limits the ability of supervisors and regulators to work effectively toward the stability of financial institutions and the financial system. For example, outside of the banking system, we have only limited information on leverage and maturity transformation rather than precise estimates for all types of nonbank entities. Conclusion To conclude, the U.S. financial system has changed a great deal over the past several decades. One of the most important changes has been the rapid growth of the nonbank sector. Many reforms have been adopted for both banks and nonbank financial institutions. But regulation is a cat and mouse game. Regulators need to respond to existing regulatory gaps and to keep pace with further changes. We hope we will succeed in doing so. But we know that we will never be able to identify in advance all the threats to stability that are out there, and that it is therefore all the more critical to maintain and strengthen the robustness of our financial institutions, and of the financial system as a whole. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Salvatore Rossi: Knowledge, innovation and relaunching the economy Speech (lectio magistralis) by Mr Salvatore Rossi, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the Almo Collegio Borromeo, Pavia, 17 March 2015. *      *      * I wish to thank the Almo Collegio Borromeo, its Rector and the President of the European Pole of Excellence Professor Dario Velo for doing me the honour of inviting me to give a lectio magistralis within these walls, imbued with history and science, and before such an accomplished audience. I also thank the President of the Collegio’s Board of Directors, Vitaliano Borromeo, for the very kind words with which he outlined my intellectual interests and professional career. The title we chose for the lesson brings together three topics – knowledge, innovation, and relaunching the economy – which constitute as many decisive challenges for our country: decisive for our future and for our role in the world. I have dedicated much thought to these topics over the years, expressing my reflections time and again in writings and public addresses. Today, I would like to draw some of the threads together, retracing and connecting up those reflections, and advancing some policy proposals.1 I will discuss the three topics of the title in reverse order. I begin, inductively, with the need to relaunch the Italian economy and set it on a stable path of efficiency, competitiveness, and progress. This, I will explain, depends on the productive system’s ability to innovate continuously both what and how it produces. I will then work back to the basis of this ability – knowledge and competence – and how and where it can be “produced”. Relaunching the economy The Seven Years’ War – Today, the Italian economy finds itself in the aftermath of a war, as it were. Not, fortunately for us, an old-style war with bloodshed and destruction, but one of those modern, virtual wars, in which factories, offices and jobs are obliterated with the click of a mouse. We now produce almost a tenth less than we did seven years ago: in manufacturing, 17 per cent less; in construction, more than 30 per cent. It is estimated that manufacturing lost one sixth of its productive capacity in this period.2 Net job destruction reached almost one million. Last year, Italian firms invested overall a third less than seven years earlier. As a whole, households spent 8 per cent less in real terms. Exports have struggled to stay on an even keel.                                                 1  I base this process on some of my recent speeches, from which I quote extensively: Artigiani o scienziati?

   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The global financial crisis of 2007–08, followed by the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010–11, inflicted far greater damage on Italy’s economy than on those of the other main advanced countries. “Why?” we must ask ourselves. The first point to make is that the aggregate data hide significant disparities. The differences between firms and between households have increased. Italy’s productive system, taken to include both industry and non-financial market services, is distributed in lopsided fashion along a line determined by size.3 The 25,000 firms located above the 50-employee line produce almost half the total value added of the sectors considered and use almost half the payroll employees: more than 5 million workers out of a total of 11 million. Some 4.3 million small firms employ, in addition to around 6 million permanent staff, 4 million self-employed workers, the very owners of the businesses. Thus, per capita value added – that is to say, productivity – is low among small firms. Labour costs are also lower, but with a much narrower gap, so that small firms are generally less competitive than medium-to-large ones. As is to be expected, almost all manufactures exports are by medium-to-large firms. The size aspect is also key in shaping investment decisions. Large or very large firms continued to increase their stock of capital during the recession years. Many small firms, on the other hand, stopped investing, except in replacement assets for “survival”. Then, in the last two years, numerous medium-size exporting firms that are both profitable and liquid have also put their investment plans on hold until the global and domestic economic outlook becomes clearer. Viewed as a whole, the contraction in consumption in these seven years was atypical with respect to past negative phases of the economic cycle. Normally, one would expect consumers to try to maintain existing standards of living during a recession despite the drop in disposable income, assuming it to be temporary. This time the opposite happened: people tightened their belts more than the drop in income warranted. Thus, they assumed that drop to be permanent, and indeed that it would continue to worsen, and so they judged it wise to increase precautionary savings.4 Did all Italian households take this line? No, there was a split between them, and this time the dividing line was generational. Living standards, in terms of quantities consumed and decisions what to consume, fell sharply among the youngest households, and not only those whose head was unemployed: young payroll workers suffered from the widespread precariousness of jobs, while the self-employed, especially those at the head of small and micro businesses, had to use their own income to solve the firm’s problems. Instead, the higher income brackets, which include few young households, increased their spending on luxury goods.5 Getting started again and moving forwards – Is the damage done by the Seven Years’ War permanent? Well, we have certainly slipped some way down as far as economic conditions are concerned and we cannot get back what we have lost. But we can make a new start, albeit beginning from a lower position than the one we occupied seven years ago. We might even progress at a faster pace than we did before we were overtaken by the double-dip recession.                                                 3  In what follows I quote data taken from Istat (2014), Struttura e competitività del sistema delle imprese industriali e dei servizi, anno 2012, Report of 27 November 2014. 4  M.L.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  All the premises are there. Prices for energy, on which we depend so heavily, are low again. The highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in the euro area has provided our firms with a favourable exchange rate, on both foreign and domestic markets, and unprecedentedly low interest rates. There is an increasingly strong drive to reform the country’s economic and social fabric, which has elicited international approval even though it has met with internal division and resistance. In the latest scenarios prepared by several forecasters, including the Bank of Italy, output will grow modestly this year, and more the next. It is a cautious and uncertain new start, however, and it needs encouragement. Many firms that could revive their investment plans hesitate to do so. If they decide in favour, it will lead to an increase in employment, and the renewed confidence will spread to households as well. Trusting that the recovery will gain strength, we must ask ourselves again why these years of crisis have been so much harder for us than for the countries against which we measure ourselves. Our analysis will take us to the root of the structural problem that has beset the Italian economy for several decades. Between the last two recessions – that of 1992–93 and that of 2008–14 – something fundamental has taken place around our economy: the dominant world technology has changed, speeding up the pace of market globalization; the euro has been created. Most of Italy’s productive system was slow to take up the new information and communication technologies as an opportunity to improve efficiency, as other national systems instead did.6 It failed to grasp immediately that its addiction to devaluations of the lira, with their short-term competitive gains but lasting inflationary consequences, had to become a thing of the past and that competitiveness needed to be structurally reinforced. In reality, the productive system could do neither because the form and structure it had inherited were unsuited, being dominated by small firms, adverse to growth even when faced with a concrete opportunity to expand in size. That situation was the legacy of a family-centric culture and even more so of a political and institutional milieu hostile to a free market and entrepreneurship. Italy has the largest productivity gap between small and medium-to-large firms of all the main European countries. Firms everywhere are born small, but then they either die or grow up quickly. In Italy, if they don’t die, they remain forever in the limbo of stunted growth. Steps must be taken to change this situation because it conflicts with the need for innovative capacity, which I will now briefly discuss. Innovation The distinctive trait of modern times is constant innovation. A century ago, someone could easily spend an entire lifetime producing or trading the same goods or services with immutable characteristics, for which customers’ demand rose and fell only with their changing financial situation. Today, no goods or services stay the same except for a very short time, after which they must be renewed, in substance or at least in presentation, if they are not to disappear from the market. Consumers want to be continually surprised by something they didn’t know existed. Producer goods too must change in order to accommodate or power innovation in final consumer goods.                                                 6  Banca d’Italia (2009), “Rapporto sulle tendenze del sistema produttivo italiano” (ed.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The very distinction between manufacturing and services is becoming blurred. More and more commonly a manufacture is just a container for services, without which it would be valueless. It is the services that determine development in the quality of the good. Smartphones are the most obvious example. Today’s manufactures/services are produced in ways that are themselves new. The digital revolution has broken down vertically integrated production systems into single tasks – logistics, accounting, component production, maintenance, marketing and so on – that can be outsourced anywhere in the world. Long supply chains have been formed, or global value chains, under the direction of a lead firm but involving dozens of subcontractors, often located in emerging countries where low labour costs more than offset the costs of coordination and transportation.7 World trade has been revolutionized, both in geographical extent and in its very nature.8 Finally, robotics is advancing by leaps and bounds. Existing technologies still leave enormous untapped potential for innovation in production methods;9 we are on the eve of an era of practically total robotization of manufacturing, with far-reaching repercussions for the labour market in both the emerging and the advanced countries.10 Save for some niches of super high-end craftsmanship, making something “by hand”, which is the origin of the word manu-facturing, will come to mean not operating a lathe but handling a mouse or a joystick to activate servomechanisms and 3-D printers. And given this trend towards the automation of material production, global value chains themselves could shorten and relocate as the cost advantage of emerging countries is eroded. Yet counterforces are also at play. Manufactures – or “robofactures” – will continue to be central to our life as containers of services. The conception and, at least in part, the production of these services will of course have to be done by flesh-and-blood workers. These workers will have to be specially educated and trained – a point to which I will return further on. Coming back to the present, Italian firms as a group have much less innovative capacity than those of other advanced economies. The split that characterizes the corporate system is also apparent in terms of capacity for innovation.11 This term “innovation” must be understood in the broad sense. It involves product characteristics and the production process, of course, but also marketing practices, corporate organization, and participation in global supply and value chains. Confining our attention to product and process innovation alone, a survey conducted at the very onset of the global crisis found that only 40 per cent of Italian firms were engaged in such innovation, far below the 64 per cent reported for German firms.12 And we also know that where explicit R&D activity is lacking, the results of innovation are not as good: firms are                                                 7  R.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  less capable of patenting inventions and industrial designs, registering brands and protecting intellectual property rights. The portion of sales accounted for by innovative products is smaller, and the chances of producing goods that are new on the market, not just new for the firm itself, are lower. The prevalent model in Italy still seems to be incremental innovation, which requires less financial and organizational resources than formal R&D activity. Total formal R&D spending came to just 1.2 per cent of GDP in Italy in 2013, compared with 2.1 per cent in the EU as a whole and 2.9 per cent in Germany. These figures are very familiar and have been widely discussed; equally well known is the fact that the gap depends not so much on public spending as on business spending, which is undercut by Italian firms’ systematically smaller size than their competitors in the other advanced countries. This feature of the Italian economy means that R&D investment is highly concentrated. In 2013 the three biggest spenders accounted for 56 per cent of total private R&D expenditure, compared with 39 per cent in Germany. And although the per capita number of Italian patents deposited with the European patent office has been rising steadily since the mid-1990s, it is still relatively low. Here again, firm size is crucial. The return on formal R&D activity is about the same in Italy as in the other advanced economies.13 Nor does sectoral specialization, despite the economy’s bias towards traditional, relatively low-tech manufactures, appear to count much; even if we could “impose” Germany’s sectoral composition on the Italian economy, the innovation gap would be narrowed only marginally.14 Smallness is coupled with an ownership structure and management practices that are often loath to take on the risks of innovation. Meanwhile, the market in venture capital – which specializes in financing the rapid growth of innovative start-ups – is still poorly developed in Italy. Above all, what is decisive is the quality of the work force. Knowledge and the “knowledge factory” Self-evidently, better educated working people have a greater capability for innovation and adapt better to organizational changes. The correlation between the share of university-trained staff in a firm and its capacity for innovation is high. When the share is above a certain threshold, the probability of the firm’s investing in R&D is greater. If there is little doubt about the benefits of a more highly skilled work force, it is not so straightforward to determine precisely which skills are required. The computerization of production processes achieved to date has put a premium on managerial and intellectual functions and made it possible to turn many repetitive functions, including intermediate functions, over to computers. The Internet and cloud computing make it unnecessary for people working together on a project to be in the same place. Many knowledge-related activities can now be performed via distance interaction. By unbundling productive functions some of them, such as planning and design, can be relocated to the other side of the world.15 In many countries these trends have led to the rapid growth of the more highly skilled professions at the expense of the intermediate. Many of the workers engaged in the latter have been forced to accept lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs, causing earnings to become polarized.                                                 13  B.H.

   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The pervasive impact on all work-related activities of mobile connection to the Internet, which is at once an enormous pool of knowledge and a concentrate of the entire world’s calculating capacity, requires new skills, such as the ability to gather, select and rapidly analyse data drawn from the web. Since this pool is also seriously polluted, the ability to instantly distinguish correct information from erroneous information presented as if it were correct is essential. Calculation capacity must be used sparingly and appropriately. This requires a powerful endowment of skills that need constantly updating to keep pace with often unpredictable changes. To develop a country’s human capital it is no longer enough to furnish a large number of students with a baggage of notions to be applied in routine fashion over the course of their working life. What educators call “competence” is indispensable, namely the ability to mobilize personal resources – knowledge, know-how, aptitudes – and outside informational resources to respond effectively to new situations.16 The importance of competence is not new. The economic historian Joel Mokyr holds that a key factor in the British industrial revolution of the eighteenth century was precisely the abundance of high-quality professional and craft skills: Effective use of knowledge, however, required not only access and incentives to create and access new technology, but also the competence to make use of it and to carry out the “instructions” contained in the blueprint of the technique. Much of the knowledge employed by artisans and engineers was “tacit”, that is, not formally written down in the “recipe” used for production, but little tricks and know-how based on experience or imitation.17 On this terrain Italy is not necessarily at a disadvantage. If you talk about the problems and prospects of our economy with entrepreneurs and managers, they regularly bring up one distinctive characteristic of Italy’s successful companies, large and small alike: the ability to adapt their products to the diverse needs of customers, moving away from standard models. That is, Italian “flexibility” is often seen as the proper response to German “reliability”. The bedrock of artisanal skills and professional competence upon which the fortune of a good part of Italian industry was built naturally favours a mind-set emphasizing competences over one tending to the mechanical application of preconceived ideas. Here Italy does not seem to suffer from any handicap. So why haven’t we managed to make greater use of this innate predisposition of Italian entrepreneurs and workers? The fact is that an abundance of skills is not enough. As Mokyr observes with respect to Britain, the right combination of artisanal skills and scientific knowledge is more highly structured: A purely artisanal-knowledge society will eventually revert to a technological equilibrium, in contrast to a society where the world of artisans is constantly shocked by infusions of new knowledge from outsiders.18 High-level scientific knowledge is essential to be at the frontier of basic and applied research; but a constructive interchange between artisans and scientists must also be developed. That is the story of the telescope. It has been told by Ludovico Geymonat as follows: We know that lens-shaped glasses had long been familiar to optical craftsmen and used by them to correct sight defects, but until Galileo all the representatives                                                 16  I.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  of high science had always looked down on them with contempt. Galileo had the courage and the intelligence to make use of these lenses for his astronomical research, artfully combining them to achieve a power of magnification that was truly exceptional for the time.19 The place where scientific knowledge and the set of competences of the most highly skilled workers are “produced” is the university20 Italy differs from the most advanced countries by the much smaller amount of resources allocated to universities by families and by the public sector:21 annual spending per student is less than 20 per cent of per capita GDP, compared with a European average of nearly 30 per cent.22 Despite the institution of the three-year university degree course, we still lack a clear distinction between “light” higher education – suitable for the blue and white collar tasks that are at the base of the production apparatus – and education designed to supply the economy with a steady flow of specialists and professionals who, in today’s globalized world, can keep up with their peers from INSEAD, MIT or London Business School. A vicious circle of supply and demand has set in. The Italian universities do not supply adequate human capital for a modern, advanced economy, while the firms that should demand it are often not equipped to recognize different degrees of quality and put the right price on them, often because they are too small. Salary levels, even in individual contracts, almost never distinguish between graduates from a low-ranking Italian university and a Harvard Ph.D. Judging by the standards of American, British and German graduate schools or the French grandes écoles, it is almost as if Italy had given up the idea of training its professional elite at home and delegated the task to universities abroad. The average American university student invests nearly $15,000 a year (at 2011 prices) in post-secondary education. The public sector adds another $8,000, bringing the total to $23,000. In Italy, converting euros into dollars at purchasing power parity, the average student gets an investment of $6,500, $2,200 from his or her family and $4,300 from the government. These numbers reflect a radical difference in fundamental social choices. In the US, investment in good education is central to the long-term spending decisions of families and also of the public sector. Anyone with even a slight familiarity with American lifestyles knows the sacrifices and the saving that so many families dedicate to this investment, going so far as to plan their children’s college admission from birth. So it should come as no surprise that that society generates such a large part of the world’s innovations in every field of knowledge and workaday practice. The other substantial difference between these two systems lies in the use that is made of public resources. In the United States the share allocated directly to families in the form of scholarships and student loans is much larger than in Italy; indeed, student loans, which provide especially strong incentives, are practically unknown here. This form of public spending leaves it to the student to determine the end beneficiary of the funds through the choice of university; it has the advantage of spurring the competition for students among universities. In countries where diplomas do not have a mandated legal value, the same regardless of individual or institution, as they do in Italy, universities will not compete by offering easy courses and high grades but by gaining the reputation for enabling their graduates to succeed in the job market, where a degree from a better institution is more valuable.                                                 19  L.

   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Still tougher challenges lie ahead. As Brynjolfsson and McAfee observe, “Computers [have] started diagnosing diseases, listening and speaking to us, and writing high-quality prose, while robots [have] started scurrying around warehouses and driving cars with minimal or no guidance”.23 Technical progress has always left entire occupations behind, soon to be replaced by others. This time around, the process may be extremely intensive, and governing it may prove complicated. In the United States, as in the main European countries, including Italy, one out of every two of today’s jobs risks being automated out of existence within a decade or two.24 For workers with special skills or simply with the right education there has never been a better time than the present because they are in a position to use technology to generate value. By the same token, for workers with merely ordinary skills there has never been a worse time than now, because the replicants to replace them are advancing rapidly and there will be no “blade runners” to stop them. But what is the right education, what do you need to keep from being swept away by the digital revolution? Acemoglu and Autor contend that work can be classified by a simple two-by-two table: cognitive/manual, routine/non-routine.25 Labour demand for all routine jobs, including cognitive ones, appears to be on a secular downswing. And in our service-based, white-collar societies, cognitive but routine jobs are extremely numerous; they embrace a large part of the middle class, which is accordingly the most seriously threatened. Conclusions Economists have always sought to determine which variables are decisive for long-term growth. Tangible capital accumulation was long considered the principal lever of development. The focus shifted next to technical progress26 and then, finally, to its determinants: namely, the capacity of firms, economies and societies to continue to “learn”;27 dynamism and home-grown creativity, the thrill of an intellectual and entrepreneurial challenge.28 How can a country acquire these talents? If aided by history, it will find them embedded in its culture and traditions. Otherwise, purposeful political action is required to stimulate the creativity of inventors and entrepreneurs. To foster new entrepreneurs, to convince the existing ones to expand their businesses by separating them from their family fortunes, to reward daring and inventiveness, to discourage positional rents – this must be today’s economic policy priority in Italy. It is a complicated task, touching on all aspects of community life, first and foremost the education system, but also the legal order, competitive conditions, and the efficiency of government. In short, the entire regulatory and institutional environment within which businesses live.                                                 23  E. Brynjolfsson and A.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Indeed, it is within firms that the knowledge and skills acquired in laboratories and lecture halls are harnessed and transformed into a constant flow of innovation, and that the economy is revitalized through the creation of jobs and the generation of demand, income, and wellbeing. It is up to politicians to perform the complex and onerous task of unblocking the virtuous circle of knowledge-innovation-economic recovery by removing futile obstacles, providing the right incentives and disincentives to safeguard matters of real public interest, and finally by ensuring social equity – whilst never forgetting that without growth all equity is vain. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stephen S Poloz: Central bank credibility and policy normalization Remarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Canada-United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce, London, United Kingdom, 26 March 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank Don Coletti, Stephen Murchison, Eric Santor, Scott Kinnear and Jing Yang for their help in preparing this speech. Introduction I am happy to be in the City and to have the opportunity to speak with you this afternoon. You can feel the pulse of the global financial system here, and it feels a bit like an irregular heartbeat to me. The recovery from the Great Recession has been a long, drawn-out affair, with some countries emerging faster than others. Long-term interest rates are extremely low, well below central banks’ inflation targets. Financial market volatility has gone up across the board, as economies and policies diverge and the prospect of policy normalization becomes more real. Today, I would like to consider what this all means for central bank credibility, which is something we should all care about. Do very low long-term interest rates and recent increases in financial market volatility represent an erosion of central bank credibility? It probably won’t come as a surprise to you that I would say no. Central banks are doing their jobs in a very challenging setting. In my time today, I will talk about what we can learn from low interest rates and increasing financial market volatility, as well as what we can expect as we go through the process of normalizing monetary policy. Long-term interest rates and credibility Let’s begin by looking at the extremely low borrowing costs we see in many economies. Consider, for example, the return that one would receive on a 10-year bond issued by any G-7 government and held until it matured. Investors would be accepting an annual return that would be below the central bank’s inflation target – in some cases, well below. What is it telling us when investors are willing to receive such low returns? Central bank policy frameworks may differ, but the concept of inflation control is at the heart of monetary policy in most economies. Are low yields an indication that investors think we will be unable to bring inflation back up to its target? To help answer this question, let’s look at the Canadian data. In a recent paper, Bank of Canada economists Bruno Feunou and Jean-Sébastien Fontaine used a term structure model to decompose the yield on a 10-year Government of Canada bond into three components: long-term inflation expectations, expectations of real short-term interest rates and the term premium. Our analysis shows that Canadian long-term inflation expectations have stayed quite close to our 2 per cent target since the onset of the financial crisis. This message is corroborated by other methods we have of measuring longer-term inflation expectations. These include surveys of professional forecasters and the break-even inflation rate that is based on comparing nominal and Real Return Bonds. Let me pause here to stress a point. Why are inflation expectations so important? It’s because well-anchored expectations help promote stability in inflation and output as well as the financial system. Solid inflation expectations also give central banks more leeway in responding to temporary shocks, such as changes in energy prices or movements in the exchange rate. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Evidence shows that, for the most part, central banks have been doing well at keeping expectations anchored in a very challenging environment. Measured in this way, it is clear to me that our credibility is intact. But we won’t take false comfort. Vigilance is required, because if long-term expectations shift away from the target, it can be very difficult to re-anchor them. So, to understand why long-term interest rates are so low, we need to look at the two other components – expectations for real short-term interest rates, and the term premium. These components account for the drop in long-term bond yields that we have seen since the crisis. This is relevant to our topic because these components have also been heavily influenced by central banks as they worked to meet their inflation goals in the aftermath of the crisis. Let me make four points here. First, expectations for real short-term interest rates depend on the level of the real neutral rate of interest – the rate that will generate just enough savings to finance investment in the long run. The Bank of Canada’s Senior Deputy Governor, Carolyn Wilkins, gave a speech last year in which she outlined why we should expect to see a lower real neutral interest rate globally. The reasons include slowing labour force growth and productivity growth in developed economies, suggesting a drop in demand for investment, and a very strong supply of savings from many emerging economies. So we must start thinking about equilibrium interest rates from a lower starting point. Second, on top of these structural factors, we’ve seen central banks react to the financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession by aggressively lowering policy rates. Several central banks, including the Bank of Canada, also found themselves constrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates. By issuing forward guidance in various forms, we were able to reduce expectations for the future level of the policy rate. This added to the pressure on expectations for real short-term rates. Third, central bank actions and forward guidance have served to reduce uncertainty about short-term policy interest rates, thus reducing the term premium. Fourth, the quantitative easing programs employed by some central banks included purchases of long-dated bonds, reducing the yields on those bonds. There is strong evidence that those purchases have even pulled down yields in markets that did not have quantitative easing, such as Canada. To sum up, there are very good reasons why long-term interest rates are unusually low, but the de-anchoring of inflation expectations is not the central driver. Rather, low long-term interest rates reflect a combination of a declining neutral rate of interest and the actions being taken by central banks to foster stronger growth in pursuit of their inflation targets. Ultimately, inflation expectations, and the inflation outcomes that support them, are how a central bank’s performance should be judged. Financial market volatility and credibility But some would judge a central bank’s credibility against a wider range of criteria, including the level of financial market volatility. In recent months, measures of volatility have risen in a wide variety of asset classes and across a number of countries, in U.S. Treasuries, in exchange rates, and in the Standard & Poor’s 500, just to give a few examples. There are many factors contributing to this increase, and I won’t try to list them all. But I will mention four. First, the forces acting on the global economy are powerful and affecting many economies differently. The post-crisis headwinds to growth, including widespread deleveraging and lingering uncertainty about the future, have proved highly persistent. Furthermore, the sharp drop in oil prices is having a significant effect, positive for some economies and negative for others. This shock surprised everyone, and the fact that it is so large and happened so quickly means that many of us have had to work hard to fully grasp all of its implications. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Several central banks around the world, including the Bank of Canada, reacted to this environment with policy announcements that weren’t fully anticipated by investors. Second, these forces are leading to a divergence in monetary policy paths among the big three central banks. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are implementing quantitative easing while the Federal Reserve is beginning the process of normalizing its policy. This divergence is naturally leading to a significant adjustment in the outlook for interest rates and currencies, as well as higher volatility in bond and foreign exchange markets. A third contributor to financial market volatility is related to global regulatory reform. The Basel III and other reforms are clearly making the global financial system safer, and that is job one. But they have also reduced incentives for banks and some dealers to hold inventory, act as market-makers and provide a shock-absorber function in times when volatility is high. Fourth, financial market volatility has been compressed in recent years by the one-sided nature of our economic outlook. With many economies operating with excess capacity, economic growth remaining weak and deflation a real threat in some economies, interest rates have been expected to stay very low for a very long time. This expectation was reinforced by forward guidance and other unconventional policies of central banks. But those expectations are starting to shift. The global recovery, although uneven and fragile, is progressing, and we are approaching a transition phase – taking the first steps on a path toward normalization, if you will. Eventually, the global headwinds will dissipate and central banks will be able to transition away from unconventional policies and return to more conventional ways of conducting monetary policy. This will mean a return to two-sided risks, where interest rates could rise or fall depending on how economies evolve. During this transition toward normal, more financial volatility is to be expected. To me, these seem to be legitimate reasons to expect higher financial market volatility today. And is the volatility we’re seeing now abnormally high? No. While market volatility has risen recently, it has done so from historically very low levels. It has begun to return closer to historical averages, not abnormal levels. So, is this increase in volatility actually a negative development? No. Above all, volatility relates to unexpected economic developments to which central banks will necessarily respond in order to fulfill their mandates. When shocks to the economy occur, whether positive or negative, higher financial market volatility is a natural consequence, an integral part of the economy’s equilibration process. Such financial volatility is neither inherently bad nor good. And if it reflects the emerging possibility that the one-sided outlook we have experienced for several years is finally becoming more balanced, then that is unambiguously good news. Getting back to normal Still, as we begin to work through the process of getting back to normal, the question remains: if explicit forward guidance can suppress financial market volatility, why not keep using it? In this context, what I mean by forward guidance is explicit statements around the future path of interest rates. Central banks inevitably talk about the future, and any such statement can be construed as a form of guidance for markets. All such forms have their uses, in the right context. But I reserve the term “forward guidance” to mean specific comments, or conditional commitments, around interest rates. There’s absolutely no question that forward guidance is a valuable part of the central bank tool kit. It has clearly been helpful in Canada and elsewhere. But as I said in a paper published last year, we at the Bank of Canada believe that statements to explicitly guide 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  market expectations about the future path of interest rates are best reserved for extraordinary times, such as when policy rates are at the effective lower bound, or during periods of market stress. Keeping forward guidance in reserve ensures that it will have a greater impact when it is deployed. Otherwise, it becomes addictive and loses some of its impact – in short, forward guidance is not a free lunch, it comes with costs. Let me elaborate by stressing some of the points I made in that paper. Forward guidance works by taking some potential actions by the central bank off the table. A commitment not to raise interest rates for a given period, or until certain economic conditions are met, can flatten the yield curve and add stimulus to the economy. But in doing so, the commitment creates a skewed bet for investors. Volatility falls, for the time being, as market participants naturally position themselves around this bet, often using significant leverage to do so. So, what happens when circumstances change, as they inevitably do? What happens when investors start to consider the possibility that the guidance will change? The positions that are stacked around the central bank’s guidance unwind, and all that suppressed volatility suddenly resurfaces in financial markets, often to levels that surpass historical averages. That’s when we pay the price of forward guidance. To be sure, when the policy rate is at the effective lower bound, the benefits of forward guidance can easily outweigh the costs. At other times, the costs loom larger. Indeed, in normal times, when economic and financial risks are clearly two-way, there is a very basic law of economics at work. Volatility happens. It is a force of nature. Economists call this underlying volatility “shocks” – unexplained shifts in consumer demand or business behaviour, or oil-price shocks, or shocks from foreign economies, and, yes, financial market shocks. This volatility must go somewhere in the economy. Central banks target inflation, which means stabilizing inflation and economic growth, not interest rates. Pursuing that mandate means that financial markets carry more of the natural volatility that arises. To make this point in its most extreme form, consider how a hypothetical, all-seeing central bank would behave. That central bank would anticipate all shocks to the economy and move interest rates up and down to offset them, so inflation would always stay right on target. Looking at the data afterward, we might think that all the interest rate and financial market volatility was unnecessary, because inflation was on target the whole time. In other words, perfect policy making might look silly, simply because people cannot see the underlying shocks – but the financial market volatility would be a natural consequence of the central bank’s efforts to achieve its mandate. Of course, we haven’t been in normal times for quite a while. We are just taking the first tentative steps toward normalization, and the road won’t always be smooth, as our recent experience in Canada illustrates. Late last year, we saw encouraging signs that the economic recovery was broadening. Stronger exports had started to be reflected in greater business investment. However, as we approached our January decision on interest rates, we had to consider the unexpected plunge in global oil prices. Given the importance of oil to our economy, this shock represented a significant downside risk to our projected inflation profile. It also posed a risk to financial stability through the reduction in income that it implied. Because lower oil prices mean lower Canadian income, the shock would worsen the debt-to-income ratio of Canadian households, even if no new borrowing occurred. We thought in January that it would be best to act sooner rather than later, given the magnitude of the shock and the immediacy of its likely effects. Indeed, oil prices were still falling, and to levels below the assumptions built into our forecast. Accordingly, we took out some insurance in the form of a 25-basis-point cut in interest rates. The reaction to this cut across the yield curve and in the exchange rate would help to cushion the blow to the economy from the oil-price decline, bringing us back sooner to full capacity and sustainable 2 per cent inflation. It would also help mitigate the rise in the debt-to-income ratio by reducing the drop in income, although debt levels could rise at the margin. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  We knew that financial markets would be surprised by the move in January, and we generally prefer to avoid surprises. But we will do what is necessary to fulfill our inflation-targeting mandate. Over the following weeks, we saw inflation decline as expected, and output expand in line with our projection. We saw financial conditions ease, and oil prices stabilize in a range reasonably close to our January projection. This made us feel increasingly comfortable with the amount of insurance we had already taken out, which led to the decision to keep rates unchanged earlier this month. The negative effects of lower oil prices are beginning to appear; the positives will take longer to emerge. So we need to watch these competing forces play out in the economy, and the January rate cut has bought us some time to monitor the situation as it evolves. Some have characterized this as a move to “data dependency.” I have to say I find this a bit strange. Data are always crucial in determining how the economy is progressing. Even in extraordinary times, central banks depend on data to help them evaluate how the economy is performing relative to expectations. As our economy gradually gets back to normal, we will continue to speak with business leaders to get their perspectives. We will continue to watch the data closely, as we always do, and see how the numbers evolve relative to our forecasts. And we will look to market participants to keep watch on the same data, and form their own opinions about what they mean. Our communications focus on explaining how we expect the economy to unfold and being transparent about the risks that the central bank is weighing. All else equal, this should help reduce the chances of surprising markets. Still, in normal circumstances, it’s natural that there would be volatility as economic surprises occur. But, we think it best to have this volatility reflected in prices in informed, well-functioning financial markets, rather than be artificially suppressed by forward guidance. Conclusion Allow me to conclude. As we have seen, well-anchored inflation expectations reflect the unwavering pursuit of our inflation goals. They show that market participants continue to believe both in our commitment and our ability to return inflation to its target. Unconventional monetary policies have played a key role, in Canada and elsewhere, in promoting growth and helping to meet our inflation goals. As the global economy shakes off the Great Recession, and the era of unconventional policies comes to an end, a return to ultra-low levels of financial market volatility is unlikely. Bouts of increased volatility can be expected as guidance-influenced positions are unwound and as markets react to shocks. As we go through the normalization process, this represents the natural reaction of financial markets to economic uncertainty and a return to a normal trading environment – not an erosion of central bank credibility. The Bank of Canada will continue to pursue and fulfill our inflation-targeting mandate. We will continue to follow the policies necessary to ensure a timely return of inflation to target while being mindful of financial stability considerations. This process takes place in an uncertain world where shocks happen daily, behaviour shifts repeatedly, and our analytical tools and models can offer only rules of thumb. In that sense, monetary policy is a very imprecise business – less like engineering and more like risk management. Ultimately, our credibility will hinge on how well we meet our mandate over extended periods of time. I’m confident that we will continue to get the job done. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  S S Mundra: Banker-borrower interplay – synergies & challenges Inaugural address by Mr S S Mundra, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the “Bankers-Borrowers-Business Meet”, organized by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), New Delhi, 23 March 2015. *      *      * Assistance provided by Shri R. Kesavan is gratefully acknowledged. 1. Shri A.C. Mahajan, Chairman, BCSBI; Shri M. Narendra, Chairman, Assocham National Council for Banking & Finance; Shri Ashvin Parekh, MD APAS LLP; other dignitaries on the dais; colleagues from the banking fraternity; members of Assocham; representatives of the print and electronic media; ladies and gentlemen! Let me begin by complimenting ASSOCHAM for flagging an issue that is so relevant and contemporaneous for the banking industry. Banks face immense challenges in the area of management of loans and advances in view of the mounting non-performing assets. These challenges exist in spite of the normal rigors that are specified by the regulator and banks’ own Head and controlling offices. An increasing number of enabling statutes and enactments coupled with fair practice lending codes make the job of a lender extremely challenging and open to scrutiny. It is against this backdrop that the bankers- borrowers “love-hate” relationships need to be analysed. It seems to be an imaginative idea on part of ASSOCHAM to invite the banking supervisor to inaugurate the session in a bid to arbitrate between the banker and borrower and invite the wrath of both! On a more serious note, a determining aspect of the banker-borrower relationship is built on trust and understanding. It is also important that these relationships neither get too cosy nor do they get too strained as either would have deleterious consequences for the sector and the larger economy. The banking regulations in a way set the ground rules for bank-borrowers relationship, while the supervisory process ensures that this relationship remains healthy. Based on my own practical experience in the field- first as a commercial banker and now as the banking supervisor, I intend to highlight some of the behavioral practices that RBI expects from the bankers and the borrowers. I would also emphasize some regulatory/supervisory concerns that currently exist and could arise from unhealthy relationships between the two. Banker-borrower relationship: Built on foundation of trust and understanding 2. Relationships demand honest discharge of certain responsibilities by the parties concerned and that alone leads to development of mutual trust and respect. This is equally applicable to a banker-borrower relationship as well. A non-receptive banker or a truant borrower is a malady that the credit system can ill-afford. The banker-borrower relationship is essentially symbiotic as both need each other. Both have certain expectations from the other and when these don’t get fulfilled on account of a malafide or fraudulent intent on the part of either of them, the relationship gets strained. Recent spurt in instances of forensic audit being conducted by bankers on their borrowers signifies a breakdown in the implicit trust. There has also been an increase in incidence of suits filed against defaulters and cases of wilful default – an unwillingness to pay, despite an ability to pay. These problems could have their genesis in a failure to exercise the right amount of prudence and due diligence on part of the banker or an ab initio intent of the borrower to defraud the bank. This, however, is not a one-way street. The bankers have also been known to be indifferent and negligent of the genuine needs or problems of the borrowers in many cases. More often than not, it is due to a lack of basic understanding of the borrowers’ business. At times it is due to factors which are beyond the borrowers’ control. In fact, both extremes- excessive or too little trust and due diligence can prove detrimental to banking business. A middle course perhaps would be the most ideal mix with the bankers 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  following the right regulatory rigor and the borrowers following a model code of conduct in their dealings. 3. Having set out the broader realm of the banker-borrower relationship; let me now turn to some specifics insofar as the expectations from bankers and the borrowers are concerned and non-observance of which can vitiate the relationship between the two. 4. Expectations from bankers i). Timely sanctioning and disbursal of the loans – Borrowers approach the banks because they need finance. The business needs varying quantum of money at different stages. I do not need to go into the details but what is of essence is observing timeliness by the banks in sanctioning the loans and disbursing as per the needs of the borrower. The borrower would have his commitments to its creditors, suppliers etc. and if these are not met his projections can go haywire. This issue is of far greater significance in case of small borrowers like MSMEs. Unlike large corporate they do not have multiple sources of finance and they could quickly go out of business. The banks also need to provide handholding support to the borrowers, especially in times of stress. ii) Adequacy of finance – A related issue is to ascertain how much finance should the bank give when the borrower approaches. It is at this stage that the efficacy of the credit appraisal process of the bank comes under scrutiny. The bankers should be able to appreciate the business prospects of the borrower and be able and willing to logically reason with the borrower about the projections and assumptions. Excessive financing might result in funds being siphoned off for other purposes and inadequate finance could mean stalled projects and idling of resources. The lending decisions cannot, however, be made alone on an idiosyncratic analysis of the riskiness of the project/business that the borrowers seeks funds for. A very important dimension to contend for the banks is risk of concentration in a particular segment. There is a need to eschew the urge to lend to a sunrise sector following the herd mentality. Concentration risk can hurt the banks badly as has been the case in past in lending to steel, mining, gems and jewellery and infrastructure sector. Exposure concentration in one sector in a geographical area (eg. Exposure to sugar mills in UP) also suffers from political risk. iii) Pricing of loan – An aspect related to adequacy of finance is the pricing of loan. Not only does the finance need to be adequate but also the price charged to the borrower. Bestowing finer pricing of loans on an inferiorly rated or an unrated borrower does raise red flags from the banking supervisor. Loan pricing needs to be risk-based, fair and transparent. If the interest rate being charged is too coercive, the borrower would be squeezed, the business would suffer with banks being forced to take the ultimate hit. 5. Expectations from the borrowers: i) Refrain from Q to Q existence – The pressure from shareholders tends to drive many imprudent business managers and owners to look for short-term wins. This is reflected in their approach whereby they look to report better financial results than the preceding quarter. In the process, they end up diluting their own internal norms such as extending larger credits than normal and also extending credit for longer periods etc. It must be understood that while the business managers may be temporary, the businesses themselves are going concerns and they cannot be expected to perform miracles even under unfavourable business environment. The efforts to appease the shareholders by all means “Fair or foul” must end. ii) Focus on core competencies – Rather than looking to make quick bucks by diversifying into so- called “hot” but unrelated activities, the businesses must focus 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  on their core competencies. Diversification, if at all, must be a well-considered and long-term measure rather than “quick-fix” decision. Another trend that has caught the attention of the borrowers is taking a view on the movement of exchange rates and keep unhedged positions. The disturbing part is that even businesses with no earnings/expenses in foreign currency are taking such bets and are likely to burn their fingers. Taking a view on currency is a job of the domain experts and the businesses having no core competency in the area & hence should resist the temptation as wrong -way bets can potentially obliterate a firm overnight. iii) Over leverage – Excessive leverage run up by the Indian corporate is a matter of great concern. Over-leveraging is like having blood pressure- too low or too high, both are detrimental to the health. While banks need to do proper due diligence taking into account a consolidated balance sheet of the group; on their part the borrowers and the large business houses must end over-reliance on borrowed funds for achieving extraordinary growth rates. Operating with too little equity in the enterprise is like treading on thin ice. Too much leverage dilutes promoter’s responsibility and has implications for banks’ ability to recover loans. Double leveraging, where promoters pledge their own shares for funding their other companies needs to be viewed with caution. This, then denigrates to a possibility where the promoter is responsible only to the extent of such shares pledged with banks while funds solicited on the strength of such securities finds its way to the books of SPVs floated or the company’s subsidiaries. I am sure that responsible corporate borrower behavior and banks’ mechanisms to counter the same will be given due thought in this seminar. iv) Diversion of funds – There are several instances of borrowers diverting money to real estate or capital market for short term gains without deploying them for purposes borrowed. Rather than de-risking the balance sheet, such short-term misadventures often prove very costy. 6. Let me now briefly touch upon some other issues which we as regulators/ supervisors of the banking sector feel uncomfortable about. The regulatory / supervisory view 7. As members of global standard setting bodies, we are committed to implementation of the global best practices in regulation and supervision. While, we continue to apply discretionary judgments in contentious issues in the best national interest, it must be understood that our actions are liable for scrutiny. We have been subjected to a peer review by a BCBS committee for regulatory consistency on Basel III capital standards already and a FSB peer review is scheduled later in the year. These developments signify the importance of being consistent in rule making and supervisory assessments. The scope for extending regulatory forbearances is getting limited by the day. With this backdrop, let me highlight some issues which should help shape the behavior of banks and borrowers alike. • While on one hand, there are issues around delaying of sanctions to borrowers resulting in escalation of project costs, very often as banking supervisors we also observe instances where bankers appear to be too liberal in sanctioning loans or bringing in restructuring or CDR dispensation for the benefit of the borrower. • The level of stressed assets in the system underscores the need to improve the monitoring of performance of banks as lenders as also the need for the borrowers to adhere to the loan covenants. A key point in this context for the banks is that they cannot afford to outsource their responsibility of credit appraisal which is a basic function to a third party. Lending is the most critical of banks’ functions and that cannot be outsourced. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • Pricing of loans does not always follow the corresponding rating. Similarly, the computation of Base Rate by the banks has not been found to be very scientific and transparent. • Often the smaller borrowers allege bias by banks in favour of corporate entities in matters of lending. An oft heard grievance from SME borrowers is the insistence on collaterals where it is neither mandated nor necessary. Perhaps there is also a need for significant percolation of regulatory intent across the wide network of branches and offices of banks. • The transparency in disclosures of fees/charges payable by borrowers for processing of loan etc. needs improvement • The regulatory intent of resolving stressed assets through the means of a Joint Lender forum framework, sometimes gets undermined due to differences amongst the bankers. There are instances of banks complaining about non-cooperation by other lenders, taking unilateral action in reaching compromises or restructuring outside the JLF, declaring wilful defaults to stall the concerted operation of JLF • Innovation is important but let us not innovate to the extent of securitising the receivables of a project which is yet to fully come into existence Early recognition of stress in loan accounts 8. A very common occurrence that strains the banker-borrower relationship is recognition of stress in loan accounts. An account can turn non-performing on account of genuine difficulties – an unfavorable business environment, certain unforeseen political, legal or judicial development. Projects do suffer from delays due to delay in getting permissions and witness cost and time – overruns. It may be difficult for even the most precise of business projections or the most efficient of credit appraisals to foresee these problems. It would be irrational on part of either the supervisor or the banker to cast aspersions on the intent of the borrowers in such cases. However, it is important in such cases that the bankers as well the borrowers do admit the problem at the earliest and initiate measures to revive the account including infusion of new equity, sanction of new debt, induction of new promoters etc. Restructuring of problem accounts is a perfectly genuine banking tool and must be used if in the bankers’ assessment the business is worthy of revival and holds economic value. Any delay in reviving a project showing signs of incipient sickness would only lead to loss of further value which the banking system /economy can ill afford. Dealing with errant behavior 9. It is a presumption in banking that all borrowers will be scrupulous and adhere to a general code of conduct. The issue is how to deal with imprudent and non-co-operative borrowers, wilful defaulters or for that matter, fraudsters? It is important that the errant borrowers are quickly brought to book and recovery proceedings be completed as early as possible. A non-performing account of whatever origin and pedigree, is a drag on the banking system and increases the cost of intermediation, which pinches an honest borrower the most. It is important for the system to weed out the unethical elements at the earliest opportunity to ensure the credibility and the efficiency of the credit system in the country. Several attempts are already underway, one of which is the establishment of a central fraud registry, which will enable quick sharing of information on entities found to be defrauding banks. RBI and IBA together have also taken upon themselves the circulation of “caution advices” relating to all types of frauds, including those pertaining to loans and advances. Efforts also need to be made to alienate the willful defaulters and fraudsters and debar them from accessing the banking system for further finance. Similarly, there would also be a need to the deviant behavior within the banking community through effective vigilance practices, quick staff accountability measures and timely institution of criminal cases in fraud cases. A 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  message needs to go down loud and clear that intentional wrong-doings will not go un-punished and lax credit monitoring or reckless sanctions will be appropriately dealt with. Conclusion 10. I am sure that not just RBI, but an industry body like the ASSOCHAM, the large assembly of bankers and borrowers gathered here are all seized of the real problems that beset the financial sector today. The need is for taking strong and timely measures. I hope the seminar would deliberate on some of the issues that I have raised today and do some soul-searching. With giant strides that have been made in IT, the banks should not find it difficult to exercise a stricter oversight regime to identify early sign of impending default. I would also exhort the borrowers (individual or corporate) to understand their basic responsibilities, co-operate with lenders and adhere to a general code of conduct and discipline. The minimum one can do is to adhere to the loan agreements. Use of judicial channels should not be too prolific and frequent; instead, these should be used to foster better borrower protection rather than to undermine the credit discipline in banks. Any lender-borrower relationship can only survive on mutual trust and co-operation; breach of trust can ultimately become either an offence (under criminal law) or a civil wrong thereby defeating the credit system in India. 11. I thank you all for inviting me here to share my thoughts. I wish the conference all success. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Interview in Il Sole 24 Ore Interview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in Il Sole 24 Ore, conducted by Mr Alessandro Merli on 17 March and published on 25 March 2015. *      *      * In the ECB latest projections, as in those of other forecasters, besides the upward revision of figures, there is a clear change of tone from “fairly gloomy” to more “upbeat”. What is happening in the euro area economy? After two recessions, the first in 2009 and another in 2010–2011 as well as an aborted recovery, we had a stabilisation of economic conditions in the course of 2013 and an improvement in early 2014, but by the late spring we were seeing a slowdown in an already weak recovery. That’s why we decided on a number of measures between June and September/October, the so-called credit easing package. Then, in November, we saw that inflation was remaining weak and, in spite of the measures we had taken, that inflation expectations had become seriously destabilised. We flagged the risk of being trapped in a 1%/1% economy: 1% inflation, 1% growth. This would create a vicious circle: if everybody revised their inflation and growth expectations downwards then there would be less investment and a debt overhang. That is why we decided to take further measures in January. In spite of favourable conditions created by the oil price, there was a high risk that some of the benefits would be saved and so the full effect of the positive supply shock would be in doubt. We have always said that low oil prices have an ambiguous effect: positive, because energy is cheaper, but negative if they reinforce the deflationary behaviour of economic agents. In January we also thought that taking further measures when there are signs of a turning point would give a boost to the economy. We believed that doing it at that moment would put us back onto a growth trajectory, reducing the risk of the de-anchoring of inflationary expectations. It’s a combination of circumstances that we hope will help to support the economic recovery: the low price of oil, better financial conditions including the currency, a more neutral fiscal policy, and also the benefit of structural reforms in some countries. These effects are visible in Ireland, Spain and Portugal, where – although painful – reforms have created the basis for a solid recovery. You have a fairly big jump in projections on growth, 0.5% or thereabouts for both 2015 and 2016, but what surprised some people in the markets was that you also expect inflation to pick up substantially between 2015 and 2016, going from 0% to 1.5%, and then to 1.8% in 2017. Some regard this as too optimistic. The pickup in headline inflation is largely due to a base effect, namely the fact that the impact on annual inflation of the drop in the price of fuel and other goods influenced by the price of oil will disappear later this year. The gradual increase in the price of oil that markets expect to see over the projection horizon and which forms part of our assumptions will also give support to our headline inflation projections. The more relevant question is on core inflation when you take the price of food and energy out: this is now at 0.7%. It gets close to 2% in 2017, converging with headline inflation. The first element in the increase of core inflation is the pass-through of the exchange rate, which is the most important impact. The second source is the indirect effect of oil prices, for instance through transportation costs. Then we have the closing of the output gap, which might lead to firms regaining some pricing power. Most analysts have been discussing our assumption of the closing of the output gap by end of 2017. Some people argue that the output gap cannot be closed with such high unemployment. But the labour market can be tight in spite of massive unemployment if observed unemployment is all structural in nature. It’s difficult to say today, but we think there will be somewhat higher wage increases in 2017, in spite of a still high jobless rate, because 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  we expect the structural component of unemployment to remain large in 2017. But the key assumption giving support to the projected inflation is not a vigorous pickup in wage costs – which in fact are going to remain moderate – but rather firms regaining pricing power. In the last year producer prices have been negative. Profits of firms have been under pressure not only because of volumes but also because of prices. Central banks normally tend to look through oil prices. Why did you have to act? As I said, there was uneasiness about the serious risks of de-anchoring in inflation expectations. Maintaining price stability is the core mandate of the ECB. In 2003 the ECB announced that, in order to avoid risks of deflation, inflation should be below but close enough to 2% in the medium term. If the ECB does not deliver on this pledge, at some point, this creates a problem of credibility. If the risk is increasing, we have to give a signal that we are ready to do what is necessary to counter it, given our mandate. In January we concluded that we were confronted with the risk of falling into deflation. The price of protection against deflation jumped. These dynamics were reversed after we took very forceful action. The switch in the projections reflects this: we were in negative dynamics, with people being very pessimistic about the long run. We tried to invert those dynamics by very strong signalling at a time when we had favourable conditions. Now, a number of people, including quite a few members of the Governing Council, argue that with conditions improving anyway, and the oil price being a temporary phenomenon, that quantitative easing (QE) wasn’t really justified. Let me clarify two points. First, there was a large majority in the Governing Council. We tried not to be overly conditioned by the question of risk-sharing. We made a purely monetary policy decision, separate from the question of doing fiscal policy through the back door. What is important is that the central bank has signalled its willingness and ability to act, to use the instruments available. The discussion on “wait and see” is a fair one, but the collective judgement of the Governing Council was that it was time to act. Second, what you see in our projections – which indeed give us some grounds for comfort – is that a more robust recovery is under way – but that this is conditional on a full implementation of what we announced in January. Where do you see the risks, now that QE has started and seems to be having a strong impact, especially on markets. The major risk is the risk of complacency. Take Italy, for example: the yields on 10-year government debt are at post-war lows, credit conditions are improving very fast, at the fastest pace in the euro area. It is clear that this additional, substantial amount of monetary accommodation will bring a lot of relief to the economy. But productivity in Italy stopped growing back in the mid-1990s, it was the worst performer among the large OECD countries, and in this long crisis, Italy has already had three recessions. It’s still a very challenging situation. The Italian economy, already debilitated by long-standing structural weaknesses, has gone through an accelerated downward trend and has underperformed other stressed economies, such as Ireland and Spain. This is now starting to be understood and we are seeing some structural reforms. But the implementation remains quite difficult. You have to communicate to people a sense of urgency and of ambition: reforms have to be done quickly and on a large scale. Implementation is key now. There is a long way to go. Monetary policy accommodation will help but will not make Italy a more productive economy. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  So QE may remove the urgency to undertake the reforms? On the contrary. It’s a window of opportunity. Monetary policy accommodation facilitates the implementation of reforms. It’s a risk if governments look at the electoral cycle and think they can just benefit from some growth and stop the reforms. Will structural reforms depress demand again? That is totally wrong. One has to be careful in selecting the right structural interventions, in prioritising the measures to take. There is a very limited window in which to carry out the reforms. Is a weaker exchange rate the main channel through which QE will help the Italian economy? I would say it’s more the financial conditions, a factor which is broader than just the exchange rate. The Italian banking system was not exposed to sub-prime, but it is very exposed to the Italian economy and government debt. So there’s a local exposure to an economy that wasn’t growing even before the crisis. The financial sector entered the crisis already weak, with low profitability and high costs. It withstood the 2009 crisis, but when the sovereign debt crisis hit in mid-2011, and interest rates on government debt went to 7%, the sector’s large portfolios of Italian sovereign securities depreciated rapidly. At that point, as was to be expected, banks retrenched, tightening credit conditions for their customers. Financial conditions became very harsh for the real economy. It took a long time to improve. Even one year ago, rates were very high for an economy that had not been growing for years and was expected to stagnate in the future. Market discipline can move from too soft to too harsh. It was perhaps not enough in the past but then it became excessive. Governments should take measures to avoid a pro-cyclical financial loop that creates instability. In Italy a lot of people are starting to think we would be better off outside the euro. Italy joined the euro because the previous regime, i.e. fixing the exchange rate and devaluing occasionally, was a source of uncertainty and instability. Markets learned how that regime worked, and therefore interest rates were constantly high, creating that snowball effect that brought Italy the very high public debt burden it has now. The country’s problem is that it entered monetary union with that high public debt and governments did not seize the opportunity offered by lower interest rates to reform the economy. Now the low interest rate environment and easier financial conditions are again facilitating the necessary reforms. It’s a window. I think this is understood: some reforms are in the pipeline. But as I said it’s always a matter of implementation. What is your early assessment of the reforms, including the labour market reform, in Italy? The so-called Jobs Act can be a very important building block in a bold reform agenda. In Spain a similar step was taken three years ago, and it was a key factor pushing the Spanish economy to generally outperform the rest of the euro area in 2014. As we have seen in Spain, the Jobs Act reform can make Italy a more attractive location for doing business. It can create new employment opportunities, reabsorb the unemployed and give more stable and better-paid jobs to those who seek work certainty. But, again, this should be the starting point of an ambitious agenda for economic reforms. It should not be the end of the efforts. The fall of the euro has been the most visible consequence of QE. There is a disconnect between the state of the economy and monetary policy, especially in respect of the dollar. Will the Fed be “patient” about a further rise of the dollar? Currencies will reflect fundamentals and that is basically what we have seen. I cannot comment further on the exchange rate movements. From the European point of view, the decline of the effective exchange rate has been relatively modest. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  But can you be accused of having started a currency war, given what other central banks have had to do to respond to your QE? We have received a lot of international support for our recent measures. We do it for domestic reasons. The IMF told us we should have done it faster, so it was no surprise for anybody. We did the credit easing first, which gave renewed incentives for banks to create credit for the real economy, but in terms of the quantity it was not sufficient. Inflation expectations were not rebounding, so we took a new set of measures. Have the TLTROs been obscured by QE? As I said, we have been positively surprised by the impact of our summer 2014 measures on the pricing of credit even before QE. What we now see is that those banks which participated in the first two operations in September and December last year have cut the price of their loans to households and companies by more than non-participating banks. They have a strong incentive to generate more loans because the advantageous borrowing conditions under the TLTROs are conditional on their actual loan flows. Also, the third tender last week went quite well in terms of volumes. So, the TLTROs are also playing an important role. Banks claim that while you tried to promote credit easing with your monetary policy, your supervisory arm, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), and the constant change in the rules makes this more difficult. The flood of changes in regulation has had a certain cyclical effect, which has been compensated by monetary accommodation. But there is no contradiction. You need to make banks safer, less leveraged, and reduce liquidity risk. It is a caricature to say that we squeeze the banks and then provide more liquidity. We want more resilient banks. Negative interest rates have now become so widespread that they must be posing some risks and interfering with your macro scenario. You could reach your target sooner than expected. I would be very cautious here about the implications of the early days of QE. You need to give the markets some time to settle and get used to our purchases of €60 billion per month. When we designed the policy we wanted to have a sustained path of inflation towards where it should be. It will take time to assess its impact. The people who said we may be in a deflationary spiral may be the same people who now say it’s too much. We’ll have a steady hand in implementation and we stick to the fact that a steady improvement in the outlook for price stability is conditional on us carrying out purchases at least until September 2016. Are you encouraging excessive risk-taking and therefore instability? We are coming from a situation in which the risk of financial instability came from inflation being permanently too low, possibly a deflation risk. A third recession would create huge financial stability problems. A shift in investment patterns by banks and other financial entities to longer-dated and riskier exposures is part of the policy of QE. Furthermore, in some countries some banks may have an excessive exposure to the sovereign. That creates a big correlation between the sovereign risk and the bank risk. Therefore, banks of the countries concerned could decide to reduce their exposure to the sovereign. Having said all this, we are monitoring financial markets constantly and with extreme care to detect pockets of exuberance. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, before the Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 23 March 2015. *      *      * Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the ECON committee, Ladies and Gentleman, I am happy to be back to this committee for my first regular hearing at the European Parliament in the year 2015. A lot has happened since we last met in November last year. With Lithuania, the euro welcomed its 19th member. On 22 January we announced our intention to extend our asset purchase programmes to buying public sector securities; we started the purchases on March 9. We also moved to a new building which we officially inaugurated last week; we unveiled our new 20 euro banknote; and in a milestone towards even greater transparency of our decision-making procedures, we published on 19 February for the first time the accounts of a monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. I know this has always been a topic very dear to your committee. In the remainder of my remarks, I will explain some important aspects of the extended asset purchase programme and present a first assessment of its effects. I will then, as the coordinators have asked me to do, elaborate on the link between price stability and financial stability and will speak briefly about the macroprudential tools the ECB has now at its disposal. Economic outlook and monetary policy The most recent data and survey evidence show that growth is gaining momentum. The basis for the economic recovery in the euro area has clearly strengthened. This is due to in particular the fall in oil prices, the gradual firming of external demand, easy financing conditions driven by our accomodative monetary policy, and the depreciation of the euro. These more positive developments are also reflected in the recent ECB staff projections. Compared with the projections from December, the outlook for 2015 and 2016 has been visibly revised upwards by 0.5 and 0.4 pp., respectively. We expect inflation in the euro area to remain very low or negative in the months ahead, because the recent fall in oil prices will continue to influence the figures until later in the year. However, inflation rates are expected to start increasing gradually towards the end of the year. They will be supported by aggregate demand, by the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and by the recovery of oil prices from their current troughs in the years ahead. The latest ECB staff projections foresee average inflation at 0.0% in 2015, rising to 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. A key factor for a full recovery of the euro area economy and ensuring that inflation does not remain too low for too long will be the extra stimulus that the Governing Council decided to introduce in January under the ECB’s expanded asset purchase program. This decision was premised on two considerations. First, the momentum supporting the economic recovery was viewed as too weak and fragile to give us sufficient confidence that inflation would return to levels closer to 2% over a policy relevant medium-term horizon. Second, the expansive potential of the monetary policy measures that had been decided between June and October was seen as uncertain. This was because they were largely 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  dependent on banks’ own decision to borrow Eurosystem funds and lend them on to their customers. The cumulative uptake under the first two targeted long-term refinancing operations stood at around €212.4 billion. Therefore, the monetary impulse had to be reinforced and needed to be quantitatively more predictable and controllable to put the economy and the outlook for price stability on a firmer footing. On 9 March, we started purchasing public-sector securities as part of our expanded asset purchase programme, which also comprises interventions in the ABS and covered bond markets. Overall, our asset purchases will amount to €60 billion per month. The pace of purchases so far puts the overall program on track to reach a total of €60 billion in March. At this point in time we see no signs that there will not be enough bonds for us to purchase. Feedback from market participants so far suggests that implementation has been very smooth and that market liquidity remains ample. Our interventions have accelerated a trend that had been evident since some time. A steady process of re-integration across financial markets and jurisdictions had been under way since the summer of 2012. What is new today, however, is that lower interest rates in capital markets are increasingly being transmitted through the entire financial intermediation chain. Lower funding costs for banks have started to influence the cost of borrowing for households and companies. As bank lending rates are being reduced, new investment projects – previously considered unprofitable – become attractive. In the short-run, this should sustain the demand for credit and investment. Indeed, the banks covered in our Bank Lending Survey confirm that the easing of lending conditions is progressing hand-in-hand with a resurgent demand for credit to finance business investment. In the longer-term perspective, this will increase potential output. We intend to carry out our purchases at least until end-September 2016, and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The Governing Council will take a holistic perspective when assessing the path of inflation. It will evaluate the likelihood for inflation not only to converge to levels that are closer to 2%, but also to stabilize around those levels with sufficient confidence thereafter. When doing this assessment, the Governing Council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on inflation trends, looking through any surprise in measured inflation (in either direction) if judged to be transient and with no implications for the medium term outlook for price stability. The positive results of our new purchase programme should not distract other stakeholders from delivering their contribution to put the economy back on track. Fiscal policies should support economic growth, while ensuring debt sustainability. A full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework. Moreover, structural reforms should be implemented promptly and with determination. The combination of improved economic structures and sound fiscal policies indeed has the potential to make our monetary policy more effective by encouraging economic actors to take advantage of improved financing conditions and increase investment. Price stability and financial stability Let me now turn, as suggested by the ECON coordinators, to the interaction between price stability and financial stability. Price stability is, as you know, the primary objective of the ECB and the Eurosystem. And achieving price stability is a necessary condition for financial stability. Clearly, unstable inflation developments can distort a wide variety of macroeconomic and financial fluctuations, to the extent that these distortions become harmful for the economy. For example, unstable inflation developments could complicate pricing of assets and blur the signals from relative asset price adjustments with detrimental effects on resource allocation. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  However, price stability is not a sufficient condition of financial stability. The last crisis proved that financial stability can be at risk even at times when price stability is achieved. And monetary policy decisions also affect expectations and a wide range of asset prices. Our monetary policy measures are necessary to achieve our primary objective of maintaining price stability. But we are nevertheless aware that they may have unintended side effects on the financial system. For example, asset prices may increase to levels that are not justified by fundamentals, while periods of low yields and volatility may invite excessive risk taking by financial investors. In turn, such developments can act as an amplifying mechanism for any eventual financial instability. At the same time, financial stability is a precondition for the efficient conduct of monetary policy. To be successful in delivering price stability, monetary policy relies on the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. In this context, a stable and non-fragmented financial system is important for the smooth transmission of monetary policy signals. We are monitoring closely any potential risks to euro area financial stability, including those from excessive risk taking. Currently these risks are contained. And should they emerge, macro-prudential policy would be best suited to address them. Recently, indeed some national authorities in the euro area have decided to implement such measures that go in the direction of preventing financial stability risks from emerging at national level. Regarding macro-prudential oversight of banks in the euro area, this is shared between national authorities and the ECB. The ECB may top-up specific national macro-prudential measures if it considers these insufficient to mitigate systemic risks. The ECB and the national authorities have at their disposal macro-prudential instruments for the banking sector, as provided in the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV/CRR). These include capital buffers, such as the countercyclical capital buffer, systemic risk buffer and capital surcharges for systemic institutions. Additional measures may also be used to improve banks capital and liquidity position, limit their large exposures or increase capital requirements for certain asset classes, such as interbank and real estate exposures. To make the most effective use of these instruments and strengthen the stability of the financial system, the ECB and national authorities regularly exchange information on macro-prudential policies. Processes for formal notifications to the ECB by national authorities regarding intended measures have already been activated. Overall, the ECB will help to identify potential financial stability risks and foster a coordinated stance for macro-prudential policies among euro area Member States. Conclusion Let me conclude by saying that I have always very much valued the exchange with your house both as an exercise of our accountability obligations and as a source of inspiration. I am therefore very much looking forward to our debate and hope that we will now have time to discuss some of the matters for which time was too short at the plenary debate. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Koji Ishida: Economic activity and prices in Japan and monetary policy Speech by Mr Koji Ishida, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Kanagawa, 26 February 2015. *      *      * I.  Developments in economic activity and prices A.  Overseas I would like to start my remarks with a look at developments in economic activity and prices, in and outside Japan. On overseas economies – mainly advanced economies – the Bank of Japan’s current assessment is that they have been recovering, albeit with a lackluster performance still seen in part. The average of real GDP growth rates of major countries and regions, weighted by value of exports from Japan, has been posting higher growth, due mainly to a pick-up in the U.S. economy, after decelerating to 1.7 percent in the January-March quarter of 2014. As for the outlook, the projections of global economic growth, released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have been revised downward repeatedly, but the projection of the growth rate gradually accelerating toward 2016 is unchanged. The Bank likewise expects that the overall global economy will moderately increase its growth rate, as advanced economies will continue to enjoy a recovery and the positive effects will gradually spread to emerging economies. Taking a closer look at developments by region, the U.S. economy has continued to see solid recovery, led mainly by private demand. According to U.S. employment statistics for February 2015, the number of employees has been increasing by more than 200 thousand people on a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis for eleven consecutive months, and the unemployment rate has been hovering at a low level. In this situation, consumer sentiment has been on an improving trend. Although wage increases have been somewhat weak, the economy is likely to continue to see solid recovery, as private consumption continues to increase on the back of the improvement in the employment situation and of low gasoline prices. The euro area economy has maintained its moderate recovery, as seen in the fact that the real GDP growth rate has been positive for seven consecutive quarters, and the slowdown in its growth momentum observed since spring 2014 has come to a halt. As for the outlook, the economy is likely to maintain its recovery, albeit at a moderate pace, mainly because the depreciation of the euro and monetary easing by the European Central Bank (ECB) are likely to contribute to underpinning the economy, although close attention should continue to be paid to factors such as the risk of low inflation becoming protracted and the effects of the situation in Ukraine and Russia. As for the Chinese economy, the year-on-year growth rate of real GDP for the October-December quarter of 2014 was 7.3 percent, unchanged from the previous quarter. The economy has generally maintained its stable growth, although its momentum has somewhat slowed due to downward pressure associated with structural reforms. As for the outlook, the Chinese economy is likely to basically continue to grow stably, although attention should be paid to an overhang in supply capacity in the manufacturing sector and to the adjustment pressure in the real estate market, mainly in local cities. Emerging economies as a whole have remained lackluster in terms of growth. Looking at developments in the East Asian region, which is closely tied with Japan’s economy, while the NIEs have been improving on the whole, mainly due to a pick-up in domestic demand, the ASEAN economies have been lacking growth momentum. As for the outlook, emerging 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches economies as a whole are likely to gradually increase their growth rates as advanced economies, particularly the United States, have positive effects on them, triggering a pick-up in domestic demand. B. Japan 1. Current situation Now I will discuss developments in economic activity and prices in Japan. The Bank’s current assessment is that the economy has continued its moderate recovery trend. The growth rate of real GDP for the October-December quarter turned positive, registering 2.2 percent on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, following the negative growth for two consecutive quarters after the consumption tax hike in April 2014, mainly due to the decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the tax hike and to adverse weather conditions. A look at developments in each demand component shows that business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend, while exports have been picking up noticeably and private consumption has remained resilient in a situation where the effects of the decline in demand following the front-loaded increase have been dissipating. Given these developments, I hold the view that, having emerged from the pause in the first half of fiscal 2014, the economy has started to show signs of returning to a moderate recovery path. Although a limited number of economic indicators has been released with regard to developments since the beginning of 2015, real exports for January showed a clear pick-up of 5.0 percent from the previous month, mainly due to an increase in exports of automobiles to the United States. Meanwhile, as for private consumption, the number of new passenger-car registrations for January declined slightly, while indicators of consumer sentiment, which had been relatively weak since 2014, have been bottoming out recently. With regard to prices, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is around 0.5 percent. The rate of increase has recently been slowing, mainly due to a fall in the prices of petroleum products caused by the decline in crude oil prices. On a basis excluding food and energy, the rate of increase in the CPI had been slowing marginally, mainly reflecting the weakness in consumption during the summer of 2014, but for December, it is unchanged from the previous month. 2.  Outlook Japan’s economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery trend. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to slow for the time being, reflecting the decline in energy prices. Meanwhile, risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the risk of low inflation rates being protracted in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. The Bank compiles and releases the Policy Board members’ forecasts for economic activity and prices on a quarterly basis. Looking at the medians of the members’ forecasts released in January 2015, the real GDP growth rate is projected to be minus 0.5 percent for fiscal 2014, 2.1 percent for fiscal 2015, and 1.6 percent for fiscal 2016. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food), excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is projected to be 0.9 percent for fiscal 2014, 1.0 percent for fiscal 2015, and 2.2 percent for fiscal 2016. Compared with the forecasts made in October 2014, real GDP growth will likely be lower for fiscal 2014, but higher for fiscal 2015 and 2016, due mainly to the positive effects from the substantial decline in crude oil prices and the government’s economic measures. With regard to the CPI, the outlook for the underlying trend is unchanged; the year-on-year rate of increase will likely be lower toward fiscal 2015, due to 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 the significant decline in crude oil prices, but that for fiscal 2016 will likely be more or less unchanged at above 2 percent, due mainly to the waning of downward pressure. 3. Keys to assessing the outlook Thus far, I have briefly outlined the current situation of and outlook for economic activity and prices. In what follows, I will discuss the three keys to assessing the outlook. a. Effects of the decline in crude oil prices The first is the effects of the decline in crude oil prices on the global economy and prices. Although crude oil prices have been rising slightly recently, they have generally been at a level substantially below their peak observed around June 2014. The following factors have been pointed to as the background to the substantial decline in crude oil prices: oil supply factors, such as the decision of a group of major oil-exporting countries to maintain their production levels despite the rise in production of other oil, such as shale oil in the United States; and a decline in demand for crude oil due to economic deceleration in emerging and European economies, for example. These factors combined are likely to have had an impact on the decline in crude oil prices. In terms of the effects of the decline in crude oil prices on Japan’s economy, as is being discussed widely, I believe that the net effect of this is likely to be positive in terms of economic activity, brought about by an improvement in corporate profits and a rise in households’ real purchasing power. On the price front, the price declines in energy – including the drop in the price of crude oil – are likely to exert downward pressure on general prices in the short term. From a relatively longer-term perspective, however, they are likely to push up general prices through an improvement in the output gap. In other words, I basically consider that the decline in crude oil prices will bring about positive effects on both economic activity and prices over time, but at the same time, I also consider that attention should be paid to its effects on certain areas of the economy. I mentioned earlier that the projections of global economic growth released by the IMF have been revised downward repeatedly, and I consider that this itself suggests the existence of vulnerable areas in the world economy despite the global recovery trend. In this situation, the decline in crude oil prices is likely to exert adjustment pressure on capital investment by the energy and resources sector, which is said to account for approximately 40 percent of such investment on a global basis. Attention should be paid to the possibility that this in turn will exert downward pressure on orders, production, and exports of Japan’s capital goods, in which the country has a competitive edge. b.  Developments in real wages The second key is developments in real wages. Since the turn of fiscal 2014, the year-on-year rate of change in real wages has been negative, due in part to the substantial increase in the rate of change in the CPI including the effects of the consumption tax hike. Meanwhile, there has been a somewhat weak recovery in consumption from the decline following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike. I believe that the decline in real wages, in addition to the effects of irregular weather, largely accounted for the weak recovery. Therefore, for private consumption to pick up clearly and maintain an increasing, albeit moderate, trend in fiscal 2015 and beyond, I consider it necessary that nominal wages rise firmly and that wages in real terms – adjusted for inflation – start rising on a year-on-year basis. On this point, let us look at recent developments in Japan’s economy. Corporate profits as a whole have been increasing, with some differences observed in the business performance between exporting firms – which benefit from the yen’s depreciation – and domestic demand-oriented firms – against which the yen’s depreciation acts as a headwind. In view of the continued tight employment situation and of developments in prices, it is my consideration that the conditions are being prepared for wages to start rising in the form of increases in base pay and bonus payments. Household income, I believe, will be a great driving force for 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches supporting a virtuous cycle in the household sector from fiscal 2015 if, as a result of wage negotiations in spring 2015, nominal wages improve to an extent that will bring about a rise in real wages; however, attention should be paid to the effects, for example, of the introduction of the macroeconomic slide formula to the pension system in Japan from fiscal 2015. c.  Developments in exports The third key is developments in exports. Real exports had been sluggish despite the substantial depreciation of the yen since the introduction of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in April 2013. A range of factors have been pointed to regarding the slow emergence of the J-curve effects; namely, cyclical factors such as the sluggishness in emerging economies and structural factors such as the increase in the relocation of production overseas by Japanese manufacturers. Given these circumstances, unlike in the past, it has become quite difficult for exports to act as the driving force of Japan’s economy even amid the situation of the yen’s depreciation. It must be noted, however, that real exports have started to rise noticeably recently. Moreover, an increasing number of firms has announced plans to expand domestic business, as some manufacturers have been shifting their production back to Japan and making import substitutions. Amid the situation of the yen’s depreciation, developments that will yield a virtuous cycle in the economy are beginning to be observed steadily, and I believe they will continue to gradually strengthen as the yen stabilizes. In determining the outlook for production and exports, it is also necessary to observe such changes in corporate behavior. II.  The Bank’s monetary policy A.  Expansion of QQE Next, I would like to discuss the Bank’s monetary policy. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 31, 2014, the Bank decided to expand QQE, which it introduced in April 2013. The specific measures of the expansion were as follows. First, the Bank decided to accelerate the pace of increase in the monetary base it provides from “an annual pace of about 60–70 trillion yen” to “an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.” Second, it decided to raise the pace of increase in the amount outstanding of the Bank’s holdings of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from “an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen” to “an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.” At the same time, the Bank decided to extend the average remaining maturity of its JGB purchases from “about seven years” to a flexible range of “about seven to ten years.” And third, it decided to purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding would be tripled to annual paces of “about 3 trillion yen” and “about 90 billion yen,” respectively. Around the time of the Bank’s expansion of QQE in October 2014, somewhat weak developments in demand following the consumption tax hike and the substantial decline in crude oil prices had been exerting downward pressure on prices. The Bank considered that, if such downward pressure remained, albeit in the short term, there was a risk that the emergence from the deflationary mindset, which had been progressing steadily, might be delayed. To preempt the manifestation of this risk and to maintain the improving momentum of expectation formation, the Bank decided on the expansion of QQE. B.  Enhancement of other fund-provisioning measures Prior to the introduction of QQE, the Bank established – on its balance sheet – the Loan Support Program, with the aim of making the effect of monetary easing permeate the entire economy. The program consists of two measures – namely, the fund-provisioning measure to support strengthening the foundations for economic growth (hereafter the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility) and the fund-provisioning measure to stimulate bank lending 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 (hereafter the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility) – and had been providing support for private financial institutions’ efforts to these ends. In January 2015, the Bank decided to extend the application period of the program by one year. It also decided, with regard to the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility, to increase the maximum amount of funds that it can provide to each financial institution from 1 trillion yen to 2 trillion yen, and also to increase the maximum amount outstanding of its fund-provisioning as a whole from 7 trillion yen to 10 trillion yen. Moreover, the Bank further enhanced the program by introducing a new framework for enabling financial institutions that do not have a current account at the Bank to use the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility and the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility through their central organizations. The Bank also decided, in January 2015, to extend the application period of the funds-supplying operation to support financial institutions in disaster areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake by one year. Through these enhancements of the existing measures, the Bank will further promote financial institutions’ lending, as well as stimulate firms’ and households’ demand for credit and continue to support the efforts of financial institutions in disaster areas toward rebuilding. C. Financial Conditions As I have described, the Bank has been implementing large-scale monetary easing through various measures. In this situation, interest rates in financial markets have been hovering at extremely low levels. Yields on 10-year JGBs are currently in the range of 0.3–0.4 percent, although there have been relatively large fluctuations recently. While the U.S. dollar/yen rate has been moving within a narrow range of 115–120 yen, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average has been in the range of 18,000–19,000 yen. Financial conditions have continued to be accommodative. The average contract interest rates on new loans and discounts and the issuance rates for CP and corporate bonds have been at low levels. Firms’ perception of financial institutions’ lending attitudes and financial positions of firms, including those for small firms, have been improving. D. Future Conduct of Monetary Policy 1. The decline in crude oil prices and the conduct of monetary policy Next, I would like to highlight two points regarding the Bank’s future conduct of monetary policy and then conclude my remarks. The first is the relationship between the decline in crude oil prices and the conduct of monetary policy. In the Bank’s interim assessment in January 2015 of the October 2014 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter the Outlook Report), the forecasts for the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) have been revised downward toward fiscal 2015 from those presented in the October 2014 Outlook Report. From a somewhat longer-term perspective, the decline in crude oil prices – the main factor behind this downward revision – will exert upward pressure on the underlying trend in prices by producing stimulus effects on the economy. In a situation where medium- to long-term inflation expectations among households and firms have been stable according to a number of surveys, as long as the path for the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI to rise again toward around 2 percent is in sight, the decline in crude oil prices should not pose any particular concern in terms of the conduct of monetary policy. In terms of grasping price developments, it has become difficult to determine the underlying trend of the CPI, due to the large fluctuations in crude oil prices. The basic approach to assessing this trend is to make a comprehensive examination of a range of indicators – particularly the CPI for all items less fresh food. Given the current situation, it is appropriate for the time being to make an assessment by also taking account of the contribution of energy items to the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food). The 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Bank’s decision to release an estimate of this contribution for the price outlook through fiscal 2016 was based on such thinking. On this point, one view is to examine the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for all items less food and energy, or the core-core CPI, in particular. However, when identifying the underlying trend in prices, I personally consider that it also is important to examine the price index that includes food, given that food expenditures in Japan account for a larger proportion of household expenditures than in other countries – such as the United States – and that the rise in the prices of daily necessities has been weighing on consumer sentiment since 2014. Furthermore, I place importance on the CPI for all items less imputed rent, which is used in the calculation of such items as real wages. Imputed rent is an expenditure that is not actually paid in the market. It has long been on a declining trend, and if this trend continues, this will exert strong downward pressure on the CPI for all items, particularly in the phase when the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services accelerates. If this turns out to be the case, various problems may arise from a gap between the rise in prices perceived by households and the rise in the CPI, or in assessing the rate of wage increase. 2.  The continuation of QQE The second point is the continuation of QQE. Almost two years have passed since the Bank introduced QQE in April 2013. So far, the Bank has committed to continuing with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary to maintain the target in a stable manner. It also has committed to examining both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and making adjustments as appropriate. As for the Bank’s outlook for prices, looking at the medians of the Policy Board members’ forecasts, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is projected to remain at 1.0 percent for fiscal 2015 due to the substantial decline in crude oil prices, but to reach 2.2 percent for fiscal 2016. If economic activity and prices develop as projected, the achievement of the price stability target of 2 percent will become more in sight over time. Although it is premature to discuss an exit strategy at this stage, if the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI accelerates in accordance with the Bank’s forecast I just mentioned, the Bank at some point will need to gradually slow the pace of QQE from the current full-speed operation. From this viewpoint, it will become all the more important for the Bank to carefully grasp and assess prevailing economic developments and the underlying trend in prices, and thereby accurately determine their outlook, in the process of preparing the Outlook Report every April and October, and of conducting the interim assessment thereof every July and January. With respect to the wording “make adjustments as appropriate” used to describe the Bank’s monetary policy stance, my understanding is that these adjustments will only be made in response to, from a longer-term perspective, a heightening of risks to achieving sustainable economic growth with price stability, such as an emergence of economic and financial imbalances, and should not be made in response to changes in the timing for achieving the 2 percent price stability target or in the pace at which this target will be achieved. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stanley Fischer: Monetary policy lessons and the way ahead Speech by Mr Stanley Fischer, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Economic Club of New York, New York City, 23 March 2015. *      *      * For over six years, the federal funds rate has, effectively, been zero. However it is widely expected that the rate will lift off before the end of this year, as the normalization of monetary policy gets underway. The approach of liftoff reflects the significant progress we have made toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that the Federal Reserve has undertaken in response to the crisis has contributed importantly to the economic recovery, though the recovery has taken longer than we expected. The unemployment rate, at 5.5 percent in February, is nearing estimates of its natural rate, and we expect that inflation will gradually rise toward the Fed’s target of 2 percent. Beginning the normalization of policy will be a significant step toward the restoration of the economy’s normal dynamics, allowing monetary policy to respond to shocks without recourse to unconventional tools. I would like to take this occasion to look back on some lessons learned during our time at the effective lower bound on the interest rate, and also to look forward.1  Monetary policy since the crisis Let me first take a step back in time. Prior to the crisis, the financial system was more fragile than we realized. Key vulnerabilities included excessive leverage, overdependence on short-term funding, and deficiencies in credit ratings, underwriting standards, and risk management. Importantly, interconnections across financial institutions heightened the risk of contagion through cascading losses. Some of these interconnections emerged from the use of complicated financial instruments that created seemingly safe and liquid assets. At the time, it was common to say that risk was being dispersed and allocated to those best able to bear it. But rather than distributing risk widely, these instruments concentrated risk on the balance sheets of a relatively small number of highly levered financial institutions. As a result, as the subprime crisis developed, market participants pulled back from risk taking, leading to deleveraging spirals and fire sales.2 The damage spread across the globe. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, international trade collapsed as panic and financial connections transmitted distress across borders.3 Of course, the economy’s vulnerabilities did not stem from the private sector alone: in the public sector, gaps in the regulatory structure allowed important financial institutions to escape comprehensive supervision, and regulators were insufficiently focused on the stability of the system as a whole.                                                 1 The views that I offer are my own and not necessarily those of any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee or of the Committee itself. 2 For a model in which fire sales can arise from uncertainty about the network of cross-exposures among banks, see Caballero and Simsek (2013). 3 The fallout from the crisis was large even in countries that had not experienced an acute financial crisis. As an example, in six Asian countries, including China and India, exports fell more than 30 percent by the beginning of 2009, and industrial production declined about 10 percent. See the discussion of China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan in Coulibaly, Sapriza, and Zlate (2011). Regarding the role of credit conditions in the collapse of international trade, see Chor and Manova (2012). 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The Federal Reserve responded aggressively to the crisis.4 By the end of 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had reduced the target federal funds rate from  5–1/4 percent to, effectively, zero. The Fed also acted forcefully as the lender of last resort – in its traditional role of providing short-term liquidity to depository institutions, and also by providing liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in key credit markets.5  In addition, the worldwide scope of the crisis called for concerted international action. Because of the global nature of dollar funding markets, the Fed authorized dollar liquidity swap lines with major central banks, beginning in December 2007. In October 2008, central bankers coordinated reductions in policy rates and the Group of Seven agreed to use all available tools to prevent the failure of systemically important financial institutions.6 The next month, the Group of Twenty announced a broad common strategy, including fiscal expansion. These steps likely prevented a second Great Depression, but they were not sufficient to avoid a severe global contraction. In the United States, with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound by the end of 2008, the FOMC judged that it could not provide much additional accommodation via its conventional tool – reducing the federal funds rate.7 Instead, the FOMC used two unconventional tools: large-scale asset purchases and enhanced forward guidance. To varying extents, foreign central banks have also been using these tools. The Fed’s asset purchases did not have the conventional aim of increasing reserve balances to pull down short-term rates.8 Rather, purchases of longer-term securities lowered longer-term yields through portfolio balance effects. The evolution of our asset purchases reflected a learning process for policymakers. In the early programs, the FOMC specified the expected quantities of assets to be acquired over a defined period. In contrast, with QE3 (the most recent round of quantitative easing, implemented from September 2012 to October 2014), the FOMC announced that we would continue to purchase securities at a certain monthly pace until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially in a context of price stability. Later, the FOMC noted that the pace of purchases was also data dependent, allowing the pace to be revised based on its assessment of progress toward its long-run objectives.                                                 4 A key trigger for the crisis was the decline in housing prices, which began in 2006 and led to uncertainty about mortgage investments. In the summer of 2007, two large financial institutions – The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., and BNP Paribas Group – suspended redemptions from certain investment funds, perhaps marking the beginning of the financial crisis. In 2008, the crisis intensified with the near collapse of Bear Stearns in March and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings in September; a full-scale financial panic ensued across much of the global financial system. 5 In our role as lender of last resort, we worked closely with the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). For example, to stem the run on money market funds, the Treasury provided a temporary guarantee and the Fed created a backstop liquidity program. In addition, the FDIC established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to guarantee certain unsecured liabilities of depository institutions and some bank holding companies. 6 On October 8, 2008, the Federal Reserve and five other major central banks jointly announced a reduction in policy interest rates. See Bank of Canada and others (2008). 7 A handful of central banks in Europe have recently set certain policy rates below zero. Specifically, the Danmarks Nationalbank, the European Central Bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank have set negative policy rates. In the United States, when the Federal Reserve sought to provide more accommodation despite the federal funds rate being, essentially, zero, we chose not to use negative rates, judging at the time that the small additional support for aggregate demand was not worth the accompanying risks to U.S. money markets and the intermediation of credit. 8 Indeed, the maturity extension program – also known as Operation Twist – did not increase reserves at all. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  With the federal funds rate near zero and the Fed creating and adjusting new asset purchase programs, it became difficult for the public to anticipate how the FOMC would likely conduct monetary policy and respond to changing economic conditions. Thus, the FOMC began to rely heavily on enhanced forward guidance to communicate its intentions. Forward guidance works in part because it also constrains the flexibility of decisionmakers when the time comes to make their future decisions.9  Nonetheless, a number of potential costs might be associated with unconventional tools. When interest rates are extremely low, risks to financial stability might grow. In addition, elevated securities holdings could reduce the Fed’s income and remittances to the U.S. Treasury when rates eventually rise.10  Further, the Fed’s quantitative easing appeared significantly to affect foreign asset markets, and to have contributed to a surge of capital inflows to emerging-market economies (EMEs).11 Our asset purchase programs were even called a “currency war.” However, eventually, most EMEs seemed glad to receive those flows. Interestingly, the asset purchases recently announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) appear to be putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates in the United States. In addition, the ECB’s policy should increase growth in Europe, which will be beneficial for U.S. exports. Although some of these benefits may be offset by the recent appreciation of the dollar, much of that increase likely reflects other factors including the relatively strong performance of the U.S. economy. Looking back, there is ample evidence that supports the view that the Fed’s asset purchases contributed to a stronger U.S. recovery, by raising the prices of the assets purchased and close substitutes, as well as those of riskier assets.12 Our experience also shows that forward guidance helped better align market expectations of Fed policy with the Committee’s policy intentions.13 In brief, unconventional policies helped bring down long-term yields both by reducing term premia and by lowering the expected path of future short-term rates.                                                 9 There is a long literature in monetary economics about time inconsistency. Time inconsistency is the notion that, to achieve good outcomes, a central bank may need to make commitments about how it will act in the future – commitments that must be credible but that, ex post, the central bank might find hard to follow through on. For canonical papers, see Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Lucas and Stokey (1983); see also Fischer (1980). The early literature focused on the inability of central banks, in normal times, to commit to high future interest rates and low inflation. Interestingly, at the zero lower bound, central banks may face nearly the opposite commitment problem: To escape a liquidity trap, a central bank may want to commit to keep interest rates low and accommodate an output boom even after the headwinds from a crisis have dissipated. See, for example, Eggertsson (2006) and Werning (2012). For additional discussion of Federal Reserve communications, see Yellen (2012) and Stein (2014). 10 For a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s remittances, see Yellen (2013). Though it is likely that remittances to the Treasury will decline later in the decade as interest rates increase, such developments would not impair the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy, and it is highly likely that average annual remittances over the period affected by our asset purchases will be higher than pre-crisis norms. In addition, the asset purchases also affect Treasury revenue by lifting economic activity and thereby tax revenue, as well as by lowering interest rates and thereby debt service costs. 11 Regarding the effects on foreign asset markets, see Neely (2011); Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub (2013); and Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014). Regarding the effects on EMEs, it appears that both conventional and unconventional policies in the United States – among other factors – have driven capital flows into EMEs. See, for example, Ahmed and Zlate (2014) and Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014). 12 See, for example, D’Amico and King (2013); Gagnon and others (2011); Gilchrist, López-Salido, and Zakrajšek (2014); and Hamilton and Wu (2012). 13 See, for example, Yellen (2011). 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The recovery from the financial crisis Despite monetary stimulus, the recovery from the financial crisis has been even more sluggish than we had expected. The slow recovery provides more evidence that severe financial crises have long-lived effects, as Reinhart and Rogoff, and others, have documented.14  The gradual pace of the recovery has likely reflected both demand and supply factors. With respect to aggregate demand, the economy faced several important headwinds: efforts by households and businesses to rebuild their balance sheets, persistently tight credit conditions, the extreme weakness of the housing sector, the significant drag from fiscal policy in the years from 2011 to 2013, and the growth slowdown in Europe and other parts of the world. Turning to aggregate supply, it appears that productivity growth has slowed.15 One notable manifestation of slow productivity growth is that last year, unemployment fell significantly further than we had anticipated as of the start of the year – a pattern that occurred in the prior four years as well – whereas gross domestic product growth fell short of our expectations, as it had in three of the four prior years. However, productivity is extremely difficult to predict. For my part, I believe that the enormous gains in human welfare that the information technology explosion seems to be generating are likely to continue, and will perhaps eventually return measured productivity growth to its long-run historical pace. Conditions for Liftoff Although the recovery has been slow, there has been significant cumulative progress. An increase in the target federal funds range likely will be warranted before the end of the year. Liftoff should occur when the expected return from raising the interest rate outweighs the expected costs of doing so. In deciding when that time has come, we will continue to monitor a wide range of information regarding labor market conditions, inflation, and financial and international developments. We anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range when there has been further improvement in the labor market and we are reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. Policy normalization Full normalization of monetary policy would allow the Fed to rely on its traditional policy framework of adjustments to the federal funds rate. However, as long as our balance sheet remains sizable, we will not be able to implement monetary policy with our traditional tool of repurchases. It is important that, when we change the rate for the first time in a long time, we are certain that we have the operational tools to control the federal funds rate – and, accordingly, we have developed and tested new operational tools to control the federal funds rate. As discussed in the FOMC’s statement titled Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which was published following the September 2014 FOMC meeting, we will use the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) as our primary tool to control the federal funds rate.16 We also plan to use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, as needed. In an ON RRP operation, counterparties may invest funds with the Fed at a given rate,                                                 14 See Cerra and Saxena (2008); Reinhart and Rogoff (2009); Schularick and Taylor (2012); Bordo and Haubrich (2012); and Howard, Martin, and Wilson (2011). 15 The slowdown in productivity growth may predate the recession and may have been exacerbated by it. See Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2013) and Fernald (2014). 16 See Board of Governors (2014a). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  possibly subject to a cap on the aggregate amount invested. Because ON RRP counterparties include many money market participants that are not eligible to receive IOER, the facility can be a powerful tool for controlling money market interest rates. Indeed, testing to date by the New York Fed suggests that ON RRP operations have generally established a soft floor for such rates.17  However, an ON RRP program also has certain risks. For example, a large and persistent program could have unanticipated and adverse effects on the structure of money markets. In addition, in times of stress, demand for the safety and liquidity of ON RRPs with the central bank might increase sharply, potentially exacerbating disruptive flight-to-quality flows.18 To mitigate these risks, the FOMC has agreed that it will use an ON RRP facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer needed. In addition, the Fed has been discussing and testing other supplementary tools, such as term reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits, and can use these tools as needed to help support money market rates. With regard to balance sheet normalization, the FOMC has indicated that it does not anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities. When the time comes, we plan to normalize the balance sheet primarily by ceasing reinvestment of principal payments on existing holdings. When the FOMC chooses to cease reinvestments, the balance sheet will naturally contract, with a corresponding reduction in reserve balances. This runoff of our securities holdings will also gradually remove accommodation, an effect that we will need to take into account in setting the stance of policy. During normalization, we will, no doubt, learn more about our different tools and make adjustments to our operating framework. In part because of this adaptability, I am confident that by using IOER and, as needed, these supplementary tools, we will be able to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate. Monetary policy after liftoff The focus of the great bulk of the discussion on monetary policy during the last few years, has been on liftoff – on the circumstances under which the FOMC will choose to raise the federal funds rate, on the date on which that will happen, and on the effect of the Fed’s very large portfolio on how it will manage the liftoff process. Those questions are natural after more than six years during which the federal funds rate has been held at its effective lower bound. But as liftoff approaches, we need to think also about what will happen next. For liftoff is only the start of the process of normalization, and, going forward, the FOMC will once again be changing the federal funds rate as necessary, both up and down. Accordingly, discussion of monetary policy needs to begin to shift to the future path of interest rates, and thus to the basis on which the FOMC will set interest rates following liftoff. There has been a lively discussion of one element of the future path of the federal funds rate: whether liftoff should be sooner with a gradual rise in the rate, or whether liftoff should occur later and be followed by a steeper path of the rate.19 These discussions are useful when                                                 17 Policymakers have discussed the benefits and costs of an ON RRP facility. For further discussion on this topic, see, for example, the FOMC minutes for June 2014, July 2014, and January 2015; see Board of Governors (2014b, 2014c, 2015). 18 See Frost and others (2015). As the authors note, an ON RRP facility can also potentially contribute to financial stability by crowding out risky short-term borrowing by financial institutions and businesses. 19 For a discussion of the tradeoffs between the risks that would be associated with departing either earlier or later from the effective lower bound, see, for example, the FOMC minutes for January 2015; see Board of Governors (2015). 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  considering the appropriate timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate. But what comes after the first increase? Standard interest rate projections might incline one to believe that the path of the federal funds rate after liftoff will consist of a steady rate of increase from zero to the longer-run normal nominal federal funds rate, which will be equal to the natural real rate of interest plus our 2 percent inflation goal. One might even look back to the period from 2004 to 2007 and conclude that the FOMC will raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points every meeting, or every second meeting, or every third meeting, depending on the date of liftoff. I know of no plans for the FOMC to behave that way. Why not? Isn’t that what the calculation of optimal control paths shows? Yes. But a smooth path upward in the federal funds rate will almost certainly not be realized, because, inevitably, the economy will encounter shocks – shocks like the unexpected decline in the price of oil, or geopolitical developments that may have major budgetary and confidence implications, or a burst of greater productivity growth, as the Fed dealt with in the mid-1990s. When shocks happen, as they do, policymakers will have to respond to at least some of them. Accordingly there is considerable uncertainty about the level of future interest rates – a degree of uncertainty that can be estimated statistically, and that should be taken into account by market participants and recognized by the FOMC when it discusses future levels of interest rates. The uncertainty about future levels of the federal funds rate can be represented in a “fan chart” – that is, a figure showing the expected path of the federal funds rate as well as a range representing the degree of uncertainty around that path.20  The two sure elements of forward guidance that the FOMC will be able to offer after liftoff are that monetary policy will continue to be aimed at fostering the Committee’s dual objectives, and that it will be data driven. As we move away from the zero lower bound, the data to which we will be responding will be driven less and less by the financial crisis and Great Recession, and increasingly by post-liftoff economic developments. Whatever the state of the economy, the federal funds rate will be set at each FOMC meeting on the basis of what the members of the FOMC believe will best enable us to meet our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability over the course of time. As the FOMC responds to incoming information, it will continue to be absolutely transparent in explaining its decisions and how and why they contribute to meeting the legally mandated dual goals of monetary policy. That transparency serves three purposes: First, it is required if we are to be accountable to the public; second, it is the best way of ensuring that monetary policy decisionmakers continue to follow sensible and rational policies; and third, it is the best way of informing the private sector of the basis on which monetary policy decisions are made and will continue to be made. With respect to forward guidance: its role has been and continues to be important in the long period in which eventual liftoff has been the key interest rate decision confronting the FOMC and the focus of market expectations. However, as monetary policy is normalized, interest rates will sometimes have to be increased, and sometimes decreased. Market participants will be able to form their expectations of future interest rates on the basis of three elements: first, the policy record of the FOMC, which might be approximated as a reaction function; second, their analysis of the current economic and financial situation and outlook; and, third, whatever guidance the FOMC will provide as to how it sees monetary policy decisions likely to unfold given the economic situation and outlook. It is likely that explicit long-term forward                                                 20 For example, the Sveriges Riksbank publishes a fan chart that displays a forecast for its policy repurchase agreement (or repo) rate, along with uncertainty bands based on historical forecast errors, showing the ranges in which the repo rate is forecast to fall with 50 percent, 75 percent, and 90 percent confidence. For the chart, see Sveriges Riksbank (2015). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  guidance will play less of a role in monetary policy after liftoff than it has during the past few years. Policymakers’ behavior is sometimes summarized as a reaction function, which can be an algebraic description of how the interest rate is set – for instance, a Taylor-type rule in which the federal funds rate reacts simultaneously to the rate of inflation and expectations of inflation as well as to the rate of unemployment and expected changes in the level of unemployment.21 However, a simple rule of that sort will, by necessity, leave out many factors that appropriately influence monetary policy, such as financial developments, temporary divergences in relationships between different measures of economic activity or inflation, and the like. A simple rule can provide the starting point for the decisions made by the FOMC, but in reaching their interest rate decision, members of the Committee will always have to use their judgment to identify the special circumstances confronting the economy, and how to react to them. To ensure that monetary policy operates in as stabilizing a way as possible, the FOMC will continue to set out, as clearly as it can, the basis of every decision that it makes, and to provide guidance on its expectations of future decisions. And on the basis of the information provided by the FOMC, of their understanding of the historical record of Fed policy decisions, and of their analysis and expectations of the state of the economy and, particularly, the financial markets, market participants will make the best decisions they can.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Cœuré: Completion of the ECB-coordinated technical cooperation programme of the Eurosystem with the Central Bank of Montenegro Introductory remarks by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the press conference on the closing of the EU-funded technical cooperation programme with the Central Bank of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro, 23 March 2015. *      *      * Dear Governor Dakić, Dear Mr Lys, Your Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to be here in Podgorica today to mark the completion of the ECB-coordinated technical cooperation programme of the Eurosystem with the Central Bank of Montenegro. Let me first of all thank Governor Dakić and the Central Bank of Montenegro for your strong support and the active involvement of your staff. We have seen seven months of intensive work and excellent cooperation designed to strengthen the institutional capacity of the central bank, an institution which is key to the overall macroeconomic and financial stability of Montenegro as it moves towards joining the European Union (EU). The programme has also helped to strengthen the contacts and relations between our institutions. I would also like to express my gratitude to our 10 partner national central banks (NCBs), namely those of Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia, who provided the expert knowledge that made this programme a success. The large number of partner NCBs in this programme is a clear indication that our institutions have not turned inward-looking, despite the major challenges faced over the past few years in the wake of the global financial crisis and then the euro area sovereign debt crisis. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the experts from all the central banks for their willingness to share their knowledge and for their dedication and commitment in taking on this additional assignment in the area of technical cooperation. Let me also express my gratitude to Mr André Lys and the Delegation of the European Union to Montenegro for funding this activity through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. It is a fine example of how European institutions can work together for the benefit of EU candidate countries. I will now briefly turn to the results of the programme and how it is embedded in our institutional relations. The main deliverable of the programme is a report that lays down recommendations for changes to the central bank law and regulations as well as processes and practices in order to prepare the Central Bank of Montenegro for membership of the European System of Central Banks, once Montenegro joins the EU. I am confident that this report will help to develop the central bank’s strategy, to strengthen its role as an institution and to smooth the path towards EU accession. Let me say that our experts could not have produced such a comprehensive report without the excellent cooperation of the Central Bank of Montenegro and the commitment of Governor Dakić and his team to this project. The needs assessment report and the recommendations, however, are not the only tangible outcomes. Throughout the whole programme, staff members of the central bank have met many colleagues from Eurosystem national central banks as well as from the ECB and have established an excellent network of contacts. They can thus draw on the expertise of many 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  national central banks that are actively participating in a number of other initiatives in the region. Our institutional relations with the Central Bank of Montenegro, and with other central banks in the Western Balkans more generally, go beyond technical cooperation. In November last year, I was pleased to welcome Governor Dakić and Vice Governors Fabris and Milošević to Frankfurt for the second high-level policy dialogue between our respective institutions. The ECB conducts such dialogues with all the central banks of those countries which are negotiating to join the EU. The ECB also launched a Regional Workshop Series last year that provides opportunities for policy discussions and technical cooperation. Both of these are based on the regular monitoring and analysis of economic and financial developments in countries which are prospective EU members. The ECB and the entire Eurosystem engage in these activities with central banks of EU candidate and potential candidate countries on account of the strong economic and financial links between the euro area and the Western Balkans, the prospect of EU integration, and the associated need for sustainable convergence. Economic and financial links between the euro area and the Western Balkans, including Montenegro, are very close. For example, banks with headquarters in the euro area account for around half of the assets of the Montenegrin banking sector, while around one third of Montenegro’s total trade is with the euro area. We therefore have a mutual interest in each other’s well-being. Capital inflows from the EU together with this region’s growing integration into pan-European production chains will help the economies here to catch up and will gradually contribute to higher living standards – provided, of course, that sound domestic policies are in place to make this happen. Similarly, economic growth in the euro area and the rest of the EU will have a positive impact on the region here. In this regard, the recovery of the economic situation in the euro area is good news for Montenegro and the Western Balkans generally. Links will grow as a result of the banking union which is being established in the EU. The new institutional set-up involves new responsibilities for the ECB, which became the banking supervisor of the entire euro area last November. The establishment of this Single Supervisory Mechanism consolidates our relationship with the Western Balkans in view of the ownership structure of the banking sector. The ECB will at the same time become the home supervisor of a large part of the banking sector in Montenegro and other countries in the region. The main reason, however, for our focus on the countries in the Western Balkans and their central banks is the prospect of EU membership. For one, the EU central banking community considers it important to support its sister institutions in this region as they seek to apply best practices for the benefit of their country and their people. This is also in the interests of all EU central banks as one day the Central Bank of Montenegro will join the European System of Central Banks and, at that time, will need to meet all relevant standards and be able to function properly within the system. Moreover, strong, stable and independent institutions are a prerequisite for sound macroeconomic policies and financial stability, which in turn are a condition for sustainable convergence. This is in the interests of Montenegro but, again, also in the interests of the euro area and the rest of the EU. Joining the European Union and eventually the euro area is not an end in itself. They are a means to an end, namely to enhance the welfare of the Member States and their citizens. In this regard, one of the key lessons of the recent crisis in the euro area is that in order to benefit from membership, countries need to achieve sustainable convergence. Convergence must not only be reached in the run-up to joining. To sustain it requires constant policy efforts in the areas of fiscal, financial and, in particular, structural policies. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Pursuing growth-promoting structural reforms while maintaining financial stability and fiscal sustainability need to be key policy priorities for economic policy-makers in this context. This applies both prior to and after EU accession. The best contribution central banks can make is to ensure price stability and to remain focused on their mandate, while having a sound institutional framework that ensures their independence. There is one point that I would like to mention which makes the Central Bank of Montenegro a special case: it does not issue a national currency. The Deutsche Mark and subsequently the euro were unilaterally introduced by the Montenegrin authorities as a parallel currency and then as the sole legal tender in a very specific historical and economic context, which we acknowledge. However, Montenegro’s unilateral use of the euro is fully distinct from any special relationship with the euro area, let alone euro area membership. According to the EU Treaties, the adoption of the euro is the end point of a structured convergence process within a multilateral framework. Our support provided in this programme therefore does not prejudge the ECB’s or the EU’s position with respect to the implications of the EU Treaties’ framework on Montenegro’s monetary regime. This will have to be duly assessed during the country’s ongoing negotiations to join the EU. Let me conclude by noting that our institutions share a common future in Europe. The results of this programme will form the basis for stronger links between the central banks of the EU and the Central Bank of Montenegro. Let me emphasise that the ECB and the Eurosystem remain committed to Montenegro and the region. Completing this needs assessment programme will not bring our cooperation to an end – on the contrary, it provides us with a solid foundation for further common work. We will devise new joint activities which take account both of your priorities and of the resources available in the Eurosystem. I wish you every success with all the work ahead on the road towards membership of the European Union. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ipumbu Shiimi: Credit information sharing in Namibia Welcoming remarks by Mr Ipumbu Shiimi, Governor of the Bank of Namibia, at the launch of the Namibia Data Sharing Alliance, Bank of Namibia, Windhoek, 2 March 2015. *      *      * Director of Ceremony Dr Prega Ramsamy, CEO of FinMark Trust Mr Phillip Shiimi, CEO of NAMFISA Mr Darrel Beghin, Executive Director, Credit Provider Association of SA Mr Grant Phillips, CEO Africa Regions, TransUnion Mr Frank Lenisa, Director, Compuscan Representatives of Lending Institutions, Distinguished invited Guests, Members of the media, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning and welcome to the Bank of Namibia! It is my singular honour and pleasure to join you this morning at this occasion to mark the launch of the Namibia Data Sharing Alliance. As you may recall, on 19 August 2013, I officiated at the Credit Information Sharing Workshop held in Windhoek organised by FinMark Trust. The purpose of the Workshop was to explore potential approaches and actions that could improve the quality and flow of credit information in Namibia for the benefit of credit providers and, ultimately, their consumers. That Workshop paved the way for the establishment of Namibia Data Sharing Alliance, as a platform for credit information sharing among credit providers in Namibia. What we are witnessing today is a beginning of an exciting journey for Namibia in terms of credit information sharing. Ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the NDSA comes at a time when the Bank is in the process of implementing the regulatory framework for Credit Bureaus. As you may be aware, Namibia did not previously have legislation for regulating credit bureaus. That position changed in August 2014 when the Credit Bureau Regulations were gazetted. The Regulations are meant to regulate the operations and conduct of credit bureaus, in order to ensure that credit information sharing is carried out within the confines of the law. As part of the provisions of the Regulations, credit providers in Namibia are now required to provide credit performance information to all registered credit bureaus. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that a complete picture of individual borrowers is obtained, to enable comprehensive affordability assessments to be done with a view to curb over indebtedness of customers. This is in line with the Bank’s mandate of enhancing and maintaining stability in the financial sector. Therefore, the broader objectives of the NDSA and the Credit Bureau Regulations are complimentary in nature. Ladies and gentlemen, the rate of a country’s economic development is driven by the ease with which individuals and productive enterprises such as SMEs access funding. Therefore, the Namibia Financial Sector Strategy (NFSS), launched by the Honourable Minister of Finance in 2012, has financial inclusion as one of its key strategic goals. Although financial exclusion has been reduced from baseline of 51% determined in 2007 to 31% in 2011, the intention is to reduce it further to 26% by 2021. In order to reach the set target, as a country, we need to devise various strategies such as improving credit information sharing, which is regarded as the catalyst to financial inclusion. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Ladies and gentlemen, good credit information sharing plays a critical role in enhancing credit to individuals and private enterprises. It enables credit providers to undertake effective credit risk assessments based on available credit history, whereas the borrowers are able to negotiate for better credit terms based on their good credit history. Therefore, initiatives such as the NDSA and the Credit Bureau Regulations will greatly contribute to the realisation of the NFSS objectives of enhancing access to finance and maintaining stability in the financial system. Director of ceremonies, ladies and gentlemen, the success of credit information sharing require a broad range of credit providers actively supplying data to the credit information system. It is thus important for all credit providers to take up membership with the NDSA and be part of this exciting initiative. I therefore call upon credit providers to join the NDSA to ensure the realisation of meaningful credit information sharing in Namibia. In conclusion, I would like to commend FinMark Trust for initiating and facilitating this noble project. This indeed demonstrates that you always stay true to your slogan of “making financial markets work for the poor”. All of us should be part of the solution of making credit cheaper and more affordable, in a responsible fashion through credit information sharing. The Bank of Namibia is proud to be associated with this project! With these few remarks, Director of Ceremonies, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to declare the Namibia Data Sharing Alliance officially launched. Thank you for your kind attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Thomas Jordan: The Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy decision and assessment of the economic situation Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Zurich, 19 March 2015. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this news conference. Following the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate, we have decided to hold an extraordinary news conference at our quarterly assessment in March, in addition to the traditional six-monthly news conferences which will take place in June and December. In my presentation, I will explain the Governing Board’s monetary policy decision and outline our assessment of the economic situation. Afterwards, my colleagues and I will be at your disposal to answer questions. Monetary policy decision I will begin with our monetary policy decision. The SNB has decided to leave the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at between –1.25% and –0.25%. Interest on sight deposits at the SNB remains at –0.75% and the exemption thresholds remain unchanged. Negative interest helps to make it less attractive to hold investments in Swiss francs. Overall, the Swiss franc is significantly overvalued and should continue to weaken over time. The SNB will continue to take account of the exchange rate situation, and its impact on inflation and economic developments, in formulating its monetary policy. It will therefore remain active in the foreign exchange market, as necessary, in order to influence monetary conditions. Since the last monetary policy assessment, the exchange rate and interest rate conditions have changed substantially. This has considerable repercussions for the inflation and growth outlook in Switzerland. Global economic outlook I will now present our assessment of the global economy. The international economic environment is developing largely in line with our previous expectations. The global economic recovery is continuing. In the fourth quarter of 2014, growth in the US remained above potential. The favourable momentum of the economy there is also reflected in the sound growth in employment. The economy picked up somewhat in the euro area. This was primarily due to strong quarterly growth in Germany. In Japan, too, demand increased. By contrast, economic developments in the major emerging economies were mixed. Consumer price inflation edged down worldwide due to lower oil prices. In many advanced economies, inflation moved into negative territory at the beginning of 2015. During the course of the year, the growth of the global economy is likely to firm gradually. Several factors are supporting this growth. First, the significant decline in oil prices is helping to increase demand. Second, monetary policy in the advanced economies remains very expansionary. The euro area, in particular, is likely to benefit from the further decline in interest rates as well as the marked depreciation of the euro. Recently, an easing in European banks’ lending conditions, which were very restrictive, has also been observed. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Despite these favourable developments, the outlook for the global economy is still uncertain. Overall, substantial risks remain, with the focus on issues relating to the economic outlook for Greece and the Ukraine conflict. Assessment of the exchange rate situation I would now like to look at the exchange rate situation. In recent quarters, this was mainly driven by diverging developments in the US and the euro area. The direction of monetary policy in the major currency areas is drifting ever further apart. While in the US a start to monetary policy normalisation is in sight, the European Central Bank (ECB) has now launched a further substantial easing of its monetary policy – its quantitative easing programme. Since the first indications of quantitative easing by the ECB in spring last year, the euro has depreciated sharply against the US dollar. In May 2014, a euro still cost almost USD 1.40. At our monetary policy assessment in December, the EUR/USD exchange rate was at 1.25. When we discontinued the minimum exchange rate on 15 January, the euro had already fallen to USD 1.18; now, in March, it is trading at USD 1.05. In other words, in the short period since our monetary policy assessment in December, the euro has lost around 15% against the US dollar; and since May 2014, as much as 25%. Given this situation, it is clear that a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 against the euro was no longer sustainable. In the weeks before 15 January, the level of intervention needed to maintain the EUR/CHF minimum exchange rate on the foreign exchange markets was already high and climbing rapidly. The further depreciation of the euro against the dollar after 15 January, and following the ECB’s decision on quantitative easing shortly afterwards, is an impressive illustration of how enormous the additional pressure would have been to maintain the minimum exchange rate. Had we delayed the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate, this would only have been at the expense of an uncontrollable expansion of the SNB balance sheet – by hundreds of billions of Swiss francs, and potentially several times Swiss GDP. Such an expansion would have severely impaired the SNB’s future ability to conduct monetary policy and substantially jeopardised the fulfilment of its mandate in the long term. Moreover, given the fact that the minimum exchange rate was no longer sustainable, further intervention would have been pointless, and the magnitude of the associated losses could not have been justified. Following the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate, the Swiss franc initially appreciated sharply against all currencies, before weakening again somewhat in recent weeks. Overall, the Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued. We expect that this will be corrected with time. We are aware that the new situation presents the Swiss economy with great challenges. Nevertheless, it cannot be compared with conditions before the introduction of the minimum exchange rate. At that time, the global economy was still dealing with the immediate effects of the financial crisis, and the Swiss franc was significantly overvalued against all currencies. The international economic environment is now much more positive. Inflation and economic outlook for Switzerland The change in the exchange rate situation also alters our assessment of the inflation and economic outlook for Switzerland, which I will outline for you now. As a result of the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate, the inflation outlook has again declined significantly. For the current year, we have reduced our inflation forecast from –0.1% to –1.1%. Together with the sharp fall in oil prices, the appreciation of the Swiss franc since the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate temporarily moves inflation further into negative territory. Inflation reaches its low point in the third quarter of 2015, at –1.2%. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Thereafter, forecast inflation rises more rapidly than in the December forecast, due to the interest rate reductions since the last monetary policy assessment. Nevertheless, in 2016, inflation will amount to –0.5%, which is 0.8 percentage points lower than in the December forecast. Not until 2017 will inflation move into positive territory again, at 0.4%. The conditional forecast assumes that the three-month Libor remains at –0.75% over the entire forecast horizon, and that the Swiss franc weakens. The inflation forecast shows that the period of negative inflation is temporary. Sustained negative inflation, or even a deflationary spiral, is not to be expected. This is in line with surveys on inflation expectations. Although survey respondents now anticipate that inflation will be significantly lower, their expectations remain in positive territory for the medium term. With the new exchange rate situation, conditions for the Swiss economy have become more difficult. In the past, entrepreneurs and employees have always found ways to deal with a strong Swiss franc, thereby demonstrating, time and again, their great flexibility. Nevertheless, every appreciation represents a fresh challenge with an uncertain outcome. Therefore we have great respect for the difficult tasks which the economy now faces. In this regard, I would like to say a few words about the economic situation in Switzerland. In the fourth quarter, the Swiss economy again grew faster than expected. On the output side, growth was relatively broad-based, with manufacturing being the main driver. Value added also rose significantly in the banking industry and the public sector. On the demand side, both consumption and equipment investment recorded favourable developments. By contrast, exports of goods and services stagnated. In December, the SNB expected annual growth of some 2% for 2015. With the appreciation of the Swiss franc since mid-January, this forecast has had to be revised. A noticeable weakening in the economy may be expected, particularly in the first half of the year. For the year as a whole, the SNB now only expects real GDP to increase by just under 1%. Given this weakening, appreciable underutilisation of production capacity may be expected in the short term. Unemployment is likely to increase moderately. The anticipated strengthening in the global recovery will have a supportive effect. Negative interest rates I would now like to turn to negative interest rates. Following the interest rate reductions since the last monetary policy assessment, the reference interest rate is now negative for the first time in the history of the SNB. This situation is new, and has therefore been discussed in detail in the public arena. I would like to emphasise that lowering the interest on sight deposits at the SNB into negative territory is a necessary monetary policy measure. Negative interest makes holding investments in Swiss francs less attractive for Swiss and foreign investors. This creates incentives to reduce inflows to the franc, and reinvest Switzerland’s traditional current account surplus abroad. Negative interest thus contributes to a weakening of the Swiss franc. The interest rate reductions had a rapid effect. As expected, the negative interest rate imposed on banks by the SNB was transmitted to the entire spectrum of money and capital market interest rates. However, low or negative interest rates are not limited to Switzerland. Low interest rates are a global phenomenon and some other countries, especially in the euro area, also have negative rates. Switzerland cannot disassociate itself from such developments. With the interest rate reduction in Switzerland, the interest rate differential to the major currency areas, which had declined to virtually zero in recent years, has now increased again. Clearly, given that the Swiss franc is significantly overvalued, the earnings outlook for Swiss franc investments compared to those in other currencies is considerably reduced. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches There is widespread discussion on negative interest rates, in part because institutional investors, and pension funds in particular, could now incur costs for holding liquidity. However, in the current environment, there are no real alternatives to our measure. Negative interest helps to reduce the overvaluation of the Swiss franc. If the Swiss franc were even stronger, this would have a direct or indirect effect on everyone in the economy: companies, households and the public sector. With all the concern about negative interest it is important to remember that when inflation is negative, real interest rates are higher than nominal interest rates. In the past, the inflation rate was often higher than the nominal rate of interest. In other words, in terms of real returns, there have been times when saving was less worthwhile than it is now, indeed, times when savings balances actually lost value in real terms. Moreover, in the current situation, efforts to circumvent negative interest rates by obtaining exemptions or shifting to cash are not in Switzerland’s general interest, since they undermine monetary policy intentions. It should be remembered, in this respect, that holding cash also entails substantial costs and is subject to a high level of risk. We will retain the current interest rate level for the time being. It will continue to support the weakening of the Swiss franc. Concluding remarks In closing, I would like to return to our decision of 15 January. Discontinuing the minimum exchange rate and reducing interest rates further are monetary policy measures for which there are no better alternatives. As I outlined previously, since the introduction of the minimum exchange rate in September 2011, the international currency relationships have changed fundamentally. In view of this development, a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro was no longer sustainable. Over the long term, adhering to the minimum exchange rate would have jeopardised the SNB’s ability to conduct monetary policy and fulfil its mandate in future. This would have saddled the Swiss economy with longer-term costs that would have been out of all proportion to the benefits of continuing to enforce the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. With the international low interest rate environment, monetary policy faces big challenges. Overall, the Swiss franc is significantly overvalued. Negative interest helps to make investments in Swiss francs less attractive and thereby correct this overvaluation over time. The SNB will continue to take account of the exchange rate situation, and its impact on inflation and economic developments, in formulating its monetary policy. It will therefore remain active in the foreign exchange market, as necessary, in order to influence monetary conditions. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Chris Salmon: Financial market volatility and liquidity – a cautionary note Speech by Mr Chris Salmon, Executive Director for Markets of the Bank of England, at the National Asset-Liability Management Europe symposium, London, 13 March 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank Andrew Butcher, Jonathan Rand, Allison Parent, Joseph Noss, Olga Cielinska, Liam Crowley-Reidy, Sebastian Vismara, Lu Liu and Yuliya Baranova for their comments and contributions. As Executive Director for Markets at the Bank of England it is my job to manage the balance sheet, implementing various policy decisions that the Bank makes. I am also responsible for ensuring that the Bank extracts as much “market intelligence” from financial market developments as is possible to inform those decisions. But it’s not my job to set policy. Given that, my remarks will focus on the key insights we have drawn from financial market developments over the past year or so, in the context of what has been quite a dynamic period for monetary policy. But I will not speculate on the future course of policy by the Bank of England or any other central bank, nor the likely effectiveness of the different strategies employed by central banks to achieve their targets. And my punch line will reveal me to be the central banker that I am: there are reasons to be cautious. In particular, recent periods of financial market volatility suggest that there are reasons to be cautious about the robustness of liquidity in core financial markets. To set the scene let me return to the middle of last summer, when volatility was exceptionally low across a range of financial markets; both compared to the period of heightened volatility that we saw in the crisis years and the period preceding it. That can be seen from this spider chart which shows measures of short-term implied volatility for a number of assets relative to these two periods. Anything less than zero is less volatile than the past, with the opposite true for positive plots (Chart 1). Our market intelligence suggests that a number of factors contributed to these stable outcomes. There was a relatively low level of uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook. The extraordinary policy easing from central banks had depressed both implied and realised volatility. Forward guidance, as well as repeated rounds of quantitative easing had also led to market participants to take comfort from the mantra of “low-for-long”. This in turn incentivised investors to “search for yield”, which of course was an intended consequence of the monetary stance, but which depressed volatility and compressed risk premia in a self-reinforcing cycle. Since last summer volatility in many financial markets has picked up and there have been a number of short-lived episodes of extreme volatility and impaired market liquidity. Implied volatilities have risen and in a number of the cases I showed earlier have returned to around pre-crisis levels (Chart 1). Moreover, longer-term measures of volatility have generally increased alongside shorter-term measures, as this chart which plots 2-year implied volatilities alongside 3-month volatilities suggests (Chart 2). We have also witnessed some very large moves in financial markets over the past six-months. Here I am going to draw on two examples – the 15 October increase in US Treasury yields following the publication of unexpectedly weak US retail sales data, and the 15 January appreciation of the Swiss franc following the SNB’s decision to remove its peg to the euro. The events had different drivers, but there are some common themes I would like to draw out. What unites the 15 October and 15 January episodes is that the immediate intra-day reaction to the news was unprecedented. The intra-day change in 10-year US bond yields was 37 bps, with most of this move happening within just an hour of the data release. The intraday range represented nearly eight standard deviations, exceeding the price moves that 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  happened immediately following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. On 15 January, the Swiss franc appreciated by 14%. The intraday range was several times that number, and market participants continue to debate the highest traded value of the franc on the day. Such events could imply that a number of major asset markets may have become more sensitive to news, so that a given shock causes greater volatility. A number of recent statistical studies also imply this conclusion, suggesting that these recent episodes are a part of a broader pattern, even if they were exceptional in their scale. The following chart, using the output of a model estimated by Bank staff, is representative of the statistical analysis just referred to1. The chart compares the estimated impact on UK equity and corporate debt asset price volatility of a given price shock in the post-crisis period relative to the pre-crisis period (Chart 3). Post crisis, both corporate debt volatility and equity market volatility appear to have become more responsive to a given price shock. This pattern is also apparent when the model is applied to a number of other important asset markets, including for example US-listed equities. Liquidity was clearly affected on each of 15 October and 15 January. Measures of trading volumes, which provide one metric of liquidity, were reportedly high on both days for most affected markets. But the ability of market participants to trade without affecting prices, or in some cases, to trade at all, was clearly very limited at various points on these days. The intra-day loss of liquidity was probably even starker on 15 January, from what we can tell, with widespread feedback that foreign exchange trading platforms stopped quoting Swiss francs for periods of time, while liquidity in the Swiss fixed income market was all but lost on the day and remained impaired for a few days. The performance of the US Treasury market was also materially affected on each of these days, such that much smaller trades than normal moved prices. But in each of these cases there were stabilising forces that meant volatility subsided and liquidity returned relatively quickly. In the case of the 15 October event, what had been a crowded trade was pushed so far from prices viewed as “justified” by fundamentals that market participants were willing to provide support to the market. Similarly there was a re-appraisal of the fundamentally justified level of the Swiss franc in the days that followed the removal of the peg, following public comments by the SNB. Volatility declined, if not all the way back to the pre-news level, relatively quickly following these initial spikes. This is most true of the 15 October episode: the implied volatility of 10-year interest rate swaps retraced about half of its upward move after two days, and was back to pre-October 15th levels within just two weeks. This quick stabilisation helped to limit contagion to other markets. Neither the increase in “baseline” volatility, nor the recent episodes I have just described, in of themselves materially affected stability in the United Kingdom. For us then, the question becomes what lessons can we learn? Why have volatility and liquidity evolved in this way? And is there an important “So what?” Starting with the “Why?”, market intelligence suggests that uncertainty surrounding the global outlook has been one factor; itself in no small part a consequence of the unexpected rough halving in the price of oil since last summer. This uncertainty can be seen in the recent increase in the dispersion of economists’ forecasts for inflation in the US, UK and euro area during 2015. Central banks themselves have reacted to the changed global outlook and monetary policy makers have been active in recent months. Indeed, so far this year 24 central banks have cut their policy rates. Moreover, the decisions by the ECB and three other central banks since                                                 1 An EGARCH model is fitted to FTSE All-Share daily returns and returns on a sterling-denominated investment-grade corporate bond flat price index. The EGARCH model allows for conditional volatility to react differently to negative and positive shocks to returns. The model is fitted on returns data split into two sub-samples of approximately equal length: pre-crisis (Jan 2001 – Jun 2007) and post-crisis (Apr 2009 – Jan 2015). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  last summer to set negative policy rates have raised questions about where the lower bound for monetary policy exists. Clearly the answer is no longer as simple as just above zero for all central banks. And those decisions are raising questions about how markets work when negative rates persist several years down the yield curve (Chart 4). The combination of this macroeconomic news and central bank action means the assumed known of “low-for-long” (but positive) policy rates which market participants could cite as little as a year ago has been replaced by a less than certain landscape, helping to explain why “baseline” volatility has picked up since last summer. But while this increase in macroeconomic uncertainty and central bank activity can explain some of the general increase in the level of volatility, it cannot explain the severity of events such as 15 October or 15 January. To explain these events we probably need to look elsewhere. The obvious place to turn to is market structure, given that FICC markets, which rely on intermediaries to make markets and warehouse risk, are going through considerable change. Here I want to highlight two important contributing themes noted by market participants in our Fair and Effective Markets Review, both related to the provision of liquidity. First, market makers have become more reluctant to commit capital to warehousing risk. During our market intelligence conversations some have suggested that this reflects a combination of reduced risk tolerance since the financial crisis, and the impact of regulation designed to improve the resilience of the financial system. This reduction in market making capacity has been associated with increased concentration in many FICC markets, as firms have been more discriminating about the markets which they make, or the clients they serve. And this trend has gone hand-in-hand with a growth in assets under management by the buy-side community. The combination has served to amplify the implications of reduced risk warehousing capacity of the intermediary sector relative to the provision of liquidity from market makers during times of market stress relative to the past. That said, I would hesitate in drawing too much of a comparison between the market liquidity of today and that of pre-crisis. You don’t need a long memory to recall the impact of under-pricing liquidity risk on the highly leveraged market makers. Returning to such a situation would be a misplaced aspiration. The second theme I want to draw out is the evolution of market micro-structure. Electronic platforms are now increasingly used across the various FICC markets. In some cases regulation has been the cause but in others, such as foreign exchange markets, firms have over a number of years increasingly embraced electronic forms of trading. This includes using “request-for-quote” platforms to automate processes previously carried out by phone. Electronic platforms are effective in pooling liquidity in “normal” times but may have the potential, at least as currently calibrated and given today’s level of competition, to contribute to discontinuous pricing in periods of stress if circuit-breakers result in platforms shutting down. There has been much commentary about the temporary unavailability of a number of electronic trading platforms in the immediate aftermath of the removal of the Swiss franc peg. A contrarian view, which I do not ascribe to, would be that no explanation is required. The argument would be that the apparent change in ability of markets to digest news is a mirage: the statistical analysis would prove to have captured a transient trend, and that intermediaries were never prepared to stand in the way of large market moves, during good times or bad. On this view, the reduction in balance sheet and the move towards electronic structures have been correlated with, but are not a cause of, the events we have seen. And the fact that the spikes in volatility have been visible in equity as well as bond markets, where market structure has not undergone as profound change as FICC markets, would be taken as supporting evidence. This view would caution against over-interpreting a few isolated case studies, where excessive market conviction – that the next move in US rates would 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  definitely be up; and the Swiss peg was immutable – led to highly crowded trades accentuating the price moves and the impact on volatility. But this is not the interpretation I lean towards. Not least because we hear from market participants that, far from biting in extreme circumstances, these are issues that FICC businesses are grappling with on a daily basis. An eight standard deviation move in US Treasuries, on weaker-than expected US retail data, lies outside the bounds of what could be considered a transient trend. Consolidation and electronification have plausibly combined to accentuate the sharp moves seen last autumn and this January. The apparent increase in the incidence of such spikes in recent months may be because the “comforting cloak” of “low-for-long” has been less of a factor in suppressing volatility in preceding months. Turning to the “So what?”, it is definitely not that the rise in volatility that is a concern per se: if anything, policymakers have long been concerned about the potential financial stability risks associated with a long period of low volatility. Even with the recent rises, volatility in most asset classes is only close to the average level of the pre-crisis period; a period which after the fact proved to have been associated with the under-pricing of risk and suppressed market volatility. Nor is it that necessarily the case that some decline in the liquidity of financial markets would be a concern: the correct answer is not always maximal liquidity as I noted earlier. We are unlikely to return to this pre-crisis world and should not see it as an aspiration. But, if we accept the hypothesis that the market’s ability to digest significant news has changed such that sudden increases in volatility and loss of liquidity are more likely, then the concern is that the stabilising factors which dampened the impact of such events in recent months may not always kick-in. In those circumstances the period of market dislocation could become more persistent, increasing the scope of spillovers across financial markets, with potentially more significant impacts for financial stability. Put another way, recent months have shown the potential for short, sharp shocks. But financial markets may not have been truly tested for the ability to absorb price moves or flows that persist for a prolonged period, or for a wider spillover between markets. As such, the “So what?” is that market participants need to take note of the recent periods of volatility and illiquidity and remain aware of the possibility of these events occurring more frequently, and the potential for them to have more persistent effects. As the Bank’s December Financial Stability Report concluded, “Adjustments will be more disruptive if investors’ pricing of liquidity risk does not fully reflect structural changes in market liquidity.” In conclusion, financial market conditions have changed quite noticeably over the past year or so. In part this is conjunctural: the macroeconomic outlook has changed and perhaps become less certain. Central banks have reacted, and in some cases pushed the innovation envelope further. Unsurprisingly these developments have been associated with more volatile financial markets. Given that policy-makers have previously been concerned that persistently tranquil financial markets could encourage excessive risk-taking, this development is not necessarily an unwelcome development. But recent months have also seen a number of short episodes of sharply-higher volatility which coincided with periods of much impaired market liquidity. There are good reasons to believe that the severity of these events was accentuated by structural change in the FICC markets. There must be a risk that future shocks could have more persistent and more widespread impacts across financial markets than has been the case in the recent past. One tool available to all central bankers to address such concerns is to raise awareness, so that traders appropriately price risk. And that is why it is only fit and proper for me to finish on a cautionary note: market participants take heed.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Financial rehabilitation and insolvency regime in the Philippines – progress and remaining challenges Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the SharePHIL’s Seminar “All You Need to Know About Financial Rehabilitation and Insolvency Act”, Manila, 17 March 2015. *      *      * Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Let me begin by thanking the organizers for this privilege to share with you the thoughts of the BSP on an important legislative initiative – the Financial Rehabilitation and Insolvency Act (also known as FRIA). We all know that FRIA became a law in 2010. What perhaps most of us do not know is: when then Senator Juan Edgardo J. Angara sponsored the bill on the Senate floor in 2009, it was the 100th year anniversary of the Insolvency Act of 1909, its precursor law. Talk about long gestation! It was therefore not surprising that the good Senator clamored for its passage, arguing that it could no longer be postponed. But more than the length of time since its precursor law, the prevailing mood of global financial insecurity then demanded its enactment. The same mood of global financial insecurity still prevails today, albeit to a lesser extent. While the rest of the world continues to grapple with the global financial crisis and its aftermath, the Philippines is in a better place. Thanks to economic reforms we have undertaken thus far. However, now is not the time to sit back and rest on our laurels. Indeed, we need to remain proactive and adopt reforms that would allow us to withstand the inevitable challenges that a growing economy such as ours faces. When former Senator Angara spoke at the Senate in 2009, he noted that, in our country, the chances of a claimant to recover his investments from a failed enterprise are a nightmarish 4.4%. In sharp contrast, the recovery rate in Japan for failed enterprises is a whopping 92.5%. Where we are now? With the passage of FRIA and the FR Rules in 2013, however, our recovery rate now stands at 21.2%. Furthermore, the World Bank Group in its June 2014 Doing Business report ranked the Philippines as #50 in the Resolving Insolvency Index in a pool of 189 countries. Not bad you may think, but we clearly still have quite a long way to go. Beyond the metrics, ladies and gentlemen, we should focus on the real goal: that of reaping the advantages of an effective insolvency regime. The FRIA is a major reform designed to promote investor confidence and contribute to financial stability and sustained growth in our economy. However, the passage of the FRIA is really just the jump-off point in achieving that goal. What are the benefits of an effective insolvency regime? To say that the presence of an effective insolvency regime is a pillar of market confidence seems contradictory, doesn’t it? Especially because we do not expect real investors to embark on a business or an economic endeavor with failure in mind. However, part of a sound business plan is knowing what you are up against – including what would happen to you and your investment, should your business turn sour. Indeed, market exit (even if it is “forced upon you”) is an integral part of the business life cycle. The principle is this – if investors (and banks) know that there are clear rules that govern recovery, they become more willing to take on new ventures and businesses. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  When you extend this principle across the many current and potential investors across markets, it then becomes intuitive and easy to appreciate that a sound insolvency regime builds confidence and is economic growth-enhancing. In addition, it also supports financial stability. Let me illustrate. From the point of view of the investor, an effective insolvency regime provides a framework for the terms on which they can be willing or prepared to lend. More particularly, the predictability and confidence in loan recovery upon default give the investors specific parameters, including price points, for their lending. In several cases, this has led to increased credit availability, lower cost of credit, or both at the same time. The experience in Brazil shows that the broad bankruptcy reform in 2005 that established greater protection to credit had led to a significant increase in the total amount of total debt (a reported 10-17 percent increase) and in the total amount of long-term debt (23 to 74 percent increase). In other words, there was also a lengthening of debt maturities. The same study also reported a 7 to 17 percent reduction in the cost of debt financing for Brazilian firms. From the broader macro point of view, a clear insolvency regime encourages entrepreneurship, when this provides a safety net for entrepreneurs, especially those who commit personal assets to start a business and personally guarantee loans to the new venture. A 2008 study that compared self-employment in 15 countries in Europe and North America between 1990 and 2005 found that more forgiving personal bankruptcy laws combined with ready access to limited liability protections, enhance entrepreneurial activity. Furthermore, when the laws also provide for a well-managed redeployment of assets to more productive firms, jobs are preserved. A corporate reorganization code in Colombia enacted in 1999 dramatically improved the efficiency of reorganization proceedings, its duration fell from an average of 34 months to 12 months. Effective reorganization in countries such as Colombia allowed a company’s workforce to remain employed and productive. From a financial stability perspective, effective insolvency laws help to reduce market disruption. In Chile, for instance, the introduction of economic insolvency advisors – who were tasked to first determine the viability of firms in financial distress as basis for insolvency proceedings to commence – laid a foundation for the smooth processing of insolvency proceedings. It allowed Chile to improve the recovery rate of distressed firms’ creditors from 19 cents on the dollar in 2004 to 30 cents in 2013. What is the relevance of FRIA to central banking? Some of you may be wondering – why the central bank governor is speaking at a seminar on insolvency and recovery. Particularly given that, the resolution processes for banks is covered under another set of laws and regulations, not the FRIA. I asked your president, Atty. Lim the same question when he invited me. He reminded me of the ardent support of the BSP during the deliberations of the law. I guess, the answer to that question therefore is – as both Francis and I agreed – the FRIA is important to the BSP as well, just as it is to you. In fact, while deliberations in Congress on the FRIA were on-going, the BSP did parallel work on formally adopting financial stability as a policy objective. You may ask, how is financial stability related to FRIA? I submit [as I alluded to earlier] that, if FRIA is well implemented, it will help promote and advance financial stability in our country. There is no textbook definition for financial stability. But in the BSP, we define financial stability as that desirable state that is achieved when the governance framework of the market and its financial infrastructure enable and ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system conducive to sustainable and equitable economic growth. Effective insolvency regimes, by saving struggling firms when possible, or by reallocating assets of failing firms more productively, contribute to the smooth functioning of the financial system. They help minimize market disruptions. Banks and investors are also more willing to lend when they know they can recover at least some of their investment when businesses 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  fail. Entrepreneurs, particularly those involved in small and medium scale enterprises, will be more willing to enter the market when they do not have to put their entire personal resources at risk. Effective insolvency regimes enable transacting parties to take calculated risks in their investment decisions. I am sure you will agree with me when I say that such an empowerment to take calculated risks is what fuels innovation. In turn, innovation is that which is at the heart of economic growth. The current Philippine growth trajectory is on an uptrend. To sustain this, we need more investments, especially from real money funds from abroad that are accompanied by new technology for innovation. While it helps that the country is now rated two notches into investment grade territory, we should be mindful this alone won’t bring in investors. Good growth prospects and higher credit ratings are undoubtedly important contributors to improving the investment environment. But they may not be enough to entice the full range of investors to come in, build businesses and create jobs for Filipinos. We should always recognize that investment decisions are highly influenced by investors’ confidence in our domestic legal system, the quality of our laws governing private and property sectors and how effective our laws are upheld and enforced. Investors look for consistency and predictability in their commercial affairs. They would want to maximize and preserve the value of their assets or ensure that their claims are upheld, prioritized or equally treated if they become creditors of insolvent debtors. It is their confidence in our legal system that will encourage them to make use of court processes should rehabilitation and insolvency issues confront them. The FRIA provides us with a menu of remedies for distressed debtors and new approaches to rehabilitation and insolvency. And because it expressly adopts the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency and accordingly, FRIA gives foreign creditors in liquidations and rehabilitation proceedings direct access to Philippine courts. Thus, opportunities for cooperation between domestic and foreign courts and domestic and foreign insolvency administrators in cross-border insolvencies and restructurings are available. What more needs to be done? Over the past 15 minutes or so, I went through a laundry list of the benefits of an effective insolvency regime. Clearly, we all appreciate that the FRIA is our take off point for reaping these benefits. However, in the 2013 Forum on Asian Insolvency Reform that the Philippine Government hosted through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, one session exhaustively deliberated on the proposition that, in the implementation of insolvency regimes, fixing the insolvency statute is not sufficient to create a well-functioning insolvency regime. I cannot agree more. Recent studies have shown that the critical success factor in effective insolvency regimes globally is: the continuation of reforms after laws are enacted. The failure of insolvency systems in countries that have already modernized their laws is due to inadequate implementation. The implementation of the law is as important as the law itself. Our distinguished audience knows all too well that the successful implementation of the FRIA can only come about through a clear understanding and consistent application of the FRIA and FR Rules by our judges and insolvency administrators. Given the special and technical competence required in liquidation and rehabilitation processes, suitable and sufficient capacity building is a necessary component. Thus, we cannot stress enough the benefit of specialized training for members of our judiciary, industry practitioners, and other stakeholders. This should include basic business and accounting training, especially for those who have neither. With the growing internationalization of finance and other businesses, we can anticipate the application of insolvency laws and rules on international corporations doing business in the country. Our courts are therefore continually called upon to be more dynamic and responsive to such economic and financial developments. We are hopeful and confident of the response 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  of our judiciary to this call, so as to give spirit to the more expeditious rehabilitation proceedings mandated under the FRIA and FR. This will help in ensuring that no delay will derail implementation of rehabilitation plans. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, at the core of it, the challenge to us is to help sustain the business confidence in our country and achieve financial stability. This we can do by actively playing our role in creating an environment with an adequate and functioning legal framework, where laws and rules are clear and well-defined, thereby enabling a consistent application by the members of our judiciary. It is evident that through FRIA we have the cornerstone for an effective insolvency regime. We can build on this foundation to ensure that the advantages of such an insolvency regime are achieved. As I close, let me congratulate the SHAREPhil let by its President, Atty. Francis Lim, and its Chairperson, Ms. Evelyn Singson, for organizing this very important seminar. I urge everyone to continue to take full advantage of this learning opportunity, to validate his/her knowledge on rehabilitation and insolvency matters, to share insights or experiences, or even to challenge ideas concerning financial rehabilitation and insolvency. Let us make this forum not just a venue to learn but also as a place to think of new ways by which we can effectively contribute in moving rapidly to an effective rehabilitation and insolvency regime and a more financially stable Philippine economy. Ladies and gentlemen, we know our end-goal. Let’s not wait another century to get there. Good afternoon and I wish this seminar great success. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Daniel Mminele: Ten years of inclusion of the South African rand in the CLS Remarks by Mr Daniel Mminele, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) Reception to mark ten years of inclusion of the South African rand in the CLS, Johannesburg, 17 March 2015. *      *      * Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It is an honour for me to make a few remarks on this occasion of the CLS Reception to mark ten years of settlement of the rand in the CLS system. I am particularly pleased that the CLS delegation to mark this key milestone is led by none other than the Chairman of the CLS Board, Mr Kenneth Harvey. We welcome you and your colleagues to South Africa, and thank you for coming all the way. The CLS is one of those mission-critical systems that can be compared to the plumbing system of a building. Just as most of us never think about the plumbing of a building and take for granted that it is there and works, the CLS also runs very much in the background of the foreign-exchange market. It is only when there is a leak or a pipe bursts that we realise how important plumbing is. In the context of the CLS, if a big pipe bursts and cannot be fixed quickly, this can result in major disruptions to the foreign-exchange market, with potential rapid spill-over effects to the rest of the financial system, which at worst could bring about financial instability on a global scale. As many of you will know, the CLS plays a fundamental role in the foreign-exchange market, where it operates the largest multi-currency cash settlement system to mitigate settlement risk for the foreign-exchange transactions of its members and their customers. In its offering, the CLS mitigates settlement risk through the provision of its unique payment-versus-payment settlement service which has direct links to the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems of the currencies it settles. In addition to mitigating settlement risk, the CLS also contributes to streamlining and standardising foreign-exchange operations, helping to reduce costs. A foreign-exchange settlement usually requires potentially large cash funding liquidity to settle the obligations of settlement members. These values are materially reduced in the CLS system through the multilateral netting of the obligations between member banks to deliver best-in-class liquidity management. As regulatory requirements for larger liquidity buffers increase, the benefits from multilateral netting at an industry level have become increasingly important. Before I briefly share with you how our participation in the CLS has grown over the years, allow me to go down memory lane for a short while. Foreign-exchange settlement risk – being the risk that originates from a situation where, in a foreign-exchange trade, one party has irrevocably paid a currency and the counterparty subsequently fails to meet its side of the deal by not delivering the other currency on time – captured the attention of regulators as a major source of systemic risk following the spectacular collapse of Bankhaus Herstatt in Germany in 1974. The creation of the CLS goes back to regulatory concerns around the collapse of Bankhaus Herstatt. In March 1996, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published the so-called Allsopp Report titled Settlement risk in foreign-exchange transactions – a strategy for addressing foreign-exchange settlement risk. This report called for action from the private sector to address settlement risk in the foreign-exchange market. The response of the private sector led to the establishment of the CLS and the launch of the CLS system with 39 members and seven currencies: the 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, UK pound sterling, and US dollar in September 2002. Since then, the system has evolved to the current state where foreign-exchange transactions in 17 currencies are settled with a peak volume to date of over 2 million transactions per day and a peak value of more than US$10 trillion per day. In its evolution, the CLS added four more currencies in September 2003: the Danish krone, Norwegian krone, Singapore dollar, and Swedish krona. In December 2004, a further four currencies were added to the settlement service, namely the Hong Kong dollar, Korean won, New Zealand dollar, and South African rand. The currencies of Israel and Mexico were implemented on the system in 2008. Joining the CLS in 2004 was a major achievement for South Africa given the stringent eligibility criteria. In briefing Parliament at the time about the risk management, liquidity, and efficiency benefits of the CLS system, then Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor Manuel, put it rather succinctly, and I quote: “The inclusion (…) demonstrates that the South African payment system provides for global best practice, and would foster domestic and international investor confidence in the integrity and robustness of the national payment system.” Back in December 2004, our central bank joined the CLS Cooperative Oversight arrangement led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as the regulator of the CLS Bank, in order to ensure that, in the settlement of the rand in the CLS system, our domestic policy objectives continued to be met. We also joined the CLS Operators Forum, also led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to ensure the coordination of relevant actions by all real-time gross settlement system operators that are linked to the CLS system. In all these cooperative arrangements, there is an appreciation of regular interaction as well as frank and constructive engagement with CLS management and executives. Before I conclude, let me share some information on our participation in the CLS system. In 2004, when we joined the system, two of our banks, namely Absa and Standard Bank, became settlement members. These banks had obtained direct access to the CLS system in terms of submitting their foreign-exchange trades. Absa has, however, since become a member of the Barclays Group and its membership has thus been terminated. It is now a submitting branch of Barclays in the CLS system. At the time, we had six Rand Nostro service providers, namely Absa, Calyon, CITI, FirstRand Bank, Nedbank, and Standard Bank. These banks provide services to CLS members in terms of either receiving rands that are purchased and settled through the CLS system or funding rands that are sold and settled through the CLS system. In terms of rand settlement members, they are in a position to receive and fund rands for their own account. As far as rand settlement in the CLS system is concerned, during 2005, an average of R83 billion worth of rand trades were settled in the CLS system on a daily basis. To settle these trades, the average daily liquidity requirement that needed to be paid into the CLS system through the SAMOS system amounted to only R6,2 billion. This resulted in a liquidity efficiency of 7,5 per cent. By 2009, the average values of rand trades that were settled in the CLS system on a daily basis had grown to R163 billion. To settle these trades, the average daily liquidity requirement that needed to be paid into the CLS system through the SAMOS system amounted to only R9 billion. This resulted in a liquidity efficiency of 5,5 per cent. More recently, during 2014, the average values of rand trades that were settled in the CLS system on a daily basis amounted to R411 billion. To settle these trades, the average daily liquidity requirement that needed to be paid into the CLS system through the SAMOS system amounted to only R8.7 billion. This resulted in a liquidity efficiency of 2,1 per cent. Thus, in the ten years of South African participation in the CLS, the average daily value of transactions settled has increased fivefold, with only a 40 per cent increase in pay-in values. From these statistics it is evident that while our market is benefiting from the risk

Among the many things highlighted by the global financial crisis was the realisation that there are certain critical, systemically important systems in the international payment and settlement environment which deserve special attention going forward. The CLS is one of them, and in this vein we in South Africa remain committed to building on our good relationship with the CLS and other fellow regulators as well as relevant international bodies, such as the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), to ensure the we continue to strengthen the system further so as to reduce the potential for systemic disruption and financial instability. As you may be aware, we are also actively engaged in implementing cross- border settlement arrangements and systems within the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and our experiences from working with the CLS are proving quite useful. To our stakeholders in the South African national payment system, the CLS Group, and, last but not least, my colleagues at the South African Reserve Bank and other regulators, all the best for the next ten years and more! 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jens Weidmann: Presentation of the Bundesbank’s annual accounts for 2014 Opening statement by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the presentation of the Bundesbank’s annual accounts for 2014, Frankfurt am Main, 9 March 2015. *      *      * 1.  Welcome Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am glad that you have come and would like to welcome you to our press conference on the annual accounts of the Deutsche Bundesbank for 2014. I would like to take this opportunity to take stock in two ways. First, with regard to the size and determinants of our balance sheet and of the Bundesbank profit. Second, I would like to refer to key political and economic developments and how they have impacted on the work of the Bundesbank. 2.  Continuing the course of reform is the order of the day The debates on economic and monetary policy in the euro area were chiefly shaped last year by low interest rates and the no more than sluggish and uneven economic recovery in the countries of the euro area. Fortunately, however, despite the continuation of the sovereign debt crisis, there were no periods of major tensions in the financial markets, such as those that occurred in 2012, for example. On the contrary: the spreads on sovereign bonds – in other words, the risk premiums which are frequently perceived as a barometer of the sovereign debt crisis – have gone back down in all of the member states severely affected by the crisis, with the exception of Greece for obvious reasons. Moreover, interest on sovereign debt has fallen to all-time lows. The governments of Italy, Spain and Portugal are obtaining funding more favourably than at any time since the introduction of the euro. An extremely accommodative monetary policy as well as continuing progress in adjustment in most of these countries are among the factors which have played a part in this. Despite differences in terms of how far countries have already implemented reform steps, the measures that have so far been taken nevertheless mostly point in the right direction. Price competitiveness has improved, although this is partly due to the depreciation of the euro. Large public deficits have been reduced and current account deficits have been massively cut back. It is now all the more important not to squander the progress made so far. Lasting success will be achieved only if budgetary consolidation and the improvement of competitiveness stay consistently at the top of the political agenda. The favourable conditions for government financing must not delude governments into thinking that further reforms are unnecessary. That naturally applies not only to the countries most affected by the crisis, but also to the large economies of France and Italy. There, too, central governments have ultimately recognised that reforms had been pushed into the background for too long – something that was also reflected in their low rates of growth. What is of crucial importance with regard to the announced reforms, however, is that they are implemented. In the end, that is the only way to measure whether the reform efforts 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  are having an effect. And that, in turn, is enormously important for the stability of the single currency area, which those two countries have a key part in shaping. Latterly, however, Greece has once again been the focus of public attention. Although the newly elected Greek government takes a critical view of the assistance programme so far and of the agreed reforms, three weeks ago it applied for the existing programme to be extended. The Eurogroup and numerous parliaments have now acceded to this wish on the basis of the existing agreements and extended the current programme by four months, but without taking on additional financial risks to begin with. For the existing programme to be extended, the Greek government had to commit to a series of economic reforms, which now have to be spelled out and then, most importantly, also implemented. Only identifiable progress on the road to sound public finances, a competitive economic structure and a functional political system will allow Greece to regain investors’ confidence and fund itself independently. Until then, the country will depend on further assistance; and I do not see that Greece can achieve an independent access to the capital market again by mid-year. But let me say one thing clearly. As I see it, further decisions about financial resources for Greece belong unequivocally in the field of politics. While fiscal policy has not approved any further financial assistance for some months now, the Eurosystem has made considerable financial resources available – to be precise, lending to Greek banks has doubled to €100 billion. Massive outflows of capital from Greece have been financed, and the Greek banks that are cut off from the capital market are dependent on funding by the Eurosystem, predominantly in the form of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) from the Bank of Greece – with which, however, only temporary liquidity problems should be bridged. Liquidity assistance, as well as Eurosystem funding quite generally, should be granted only to solvent banks. This was something that Mario Draghi stressed once again at the press conference of the last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Since banks and central government in Greece are very closely intertwined, however, the situation of the banks depends very heavily on whether the Greek government is solvent. The Eurosystem should pay careful attention to whether the Greek banks do not worsen their liquidity position by acquiring Greek government bonds for which there is de facto still no market. Otherwise, there might arise the suspicion that the Eurosystem does not take the prohibition of monetary financing so seriously. That was something Mario Draghi clearly pointed out, too. Given the government’s and banks’ lack of market access, financing of the Greek government via banks that, in turn, avail themselves of the monetary policy financing opportunities or the granting of ELA by the Bank of Greece, also raises obvious concerns with regard to the prohibition of monetary financing. In this specific situation, governments and parliaments must decide whether they are prepared to go on extending the Greek risks and cover the funding needs of the Greek government despite the tangible uncertainty with regard to the government’s will to reform. I see this less than ever as a task within the remit of the Eurosystem. First and foremost, of course, the onus is on the Greek government. By means of credible and also quantifiable reform commitments, it must lay the foundation for a continuation of the support provided by the available assistance mechanisms. In this respect, a lot of confidence has been lost recently. Allow me to make one thing absolutely clear. The composition of the euro area is a political decision. Every country that has joined the monetary union also bears the responsibility to 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  contribute to the stability of the single currency with its policy and by compliance with the rules. This is also a matter of the general public’s confidence in the single currency and its institutions and, at the end of the day, the promise that the monetary union is a community of stability. 3.  Liability principle and commitment to fiscal rules Ladies and gentlemen, it is not just the current situation in Greece but the sovereign debt crisis as a whole which demonstrates how quickly a situation can develop in which the Eurosystem comes under pressure to take on fiscal risks. In order to protect monetary policy from such risks, the euro area’s founders relied on sound public finances, which were to be ensured through the adoption of fiscal rules, amongst other things. Unfortunately, neither the rules themselves nor their implementation were strict enough in the past. And currently, there is not much to suggest that things will improve in the future. Quite the opposite, in fact. The point of this is not about observing these limits for the budgetary rules’ sake, placing constraints on government authorities or pushing through austerity programmes. It is about ensuring public finance sustainability and restoring confidence in sound government budgets. This is an important requirement for a stable single currency and for ensuring that monetary policy does not risk being drawn into a fiscal policy maelstrom from which it can no longer free itself. Budgetary rules are anchors of trust. They tend to be adopted and have their importance stressed most when trust is urgently required. When the monetary union was established, the focus was on creating trust in the new currency. The decision to commit to the common currency on a permanent basis was, in return, to be accompanied by a reliable prospect of sound public finances. At the height of the crisis, the focus was then on obtaining approval for large-scale joint liability via the newly created European support funds. Trust also had to be built here. In return for joint liability, stricter fiscal rules were promised. The tougher fiscal rules were also intended to help restore confidence on the capital market, in an attempt to curb the increase in risk premiums. As time went on, the risk premiums did in fact fall. But this was probably also because monetary policymakers had assumed significant fiscal risks – the Securities Market Programme (SMP), for example – or announced that they were prepared to do so if necessary – here, I refer to outright monetary transactions (OMT). With pressure being reduced via the capital markets and given the security gained from the sizeable fiscal support funds, motivation to decrease deficits and debt evidently also declined. Calls for “flexibility” in the fiscal rules grew louder, and the European Commission eventually gave in to the political pressure. The Commission took advantage of its stronger position with regard to the rules, which actually should have ensured stricter implementation of them, to interpret the rules with greater political leeway and to take a softer approach to their implementation. As a result, the rules are more flexible and political today than ever before. They have become extremely complex and have hardly any logic to them. Much scope is allowed for discretion and exemptions, meaning the binding effect of the rules is now weaker than before the crisis. The recent development in France’s excessive deficit procedure poses a problem with regard to the binding effect of the fiscal policy agreements. It also weakens other coordination procedures and it certainly provides a reason not to expand euro-area joint liability elements 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  further, as has often been called for. Liability without sufficient control undermines the stability foundation of monetary union. 4.  Monetary policy stance eased further by purchase programme in early 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn to the topic of monetary policy. Inflationary pressures in the euro area have been exceedingly low, especially since the second half of 2014. The ECB Governing Council responded by implementing a number of measures designed to loosen still further their already expansionary monetary policy stance. Public attention was particularly drawn to the expanded asset purchase programme adopted in January of this year. You don’t need me to tell you that I had my qualms about this decision. But the ECB Governing Council faces a tricky monetary policy situation – inflation rates right now are far off our medium-term target. Indeed, some measures of long-term inflation expectations have even diminished distinctly in recent months. But that’s not just the case in the euro area; other advanced economies that have already engaged in large-scale bond purchases also find themselves in the same boat. Finding the right monetary policy response to this predicament is anything but easy. The way policymakers interpret the drivers fuelling the current low inflation rates is naturally an important consideration. My preferred response would have been to “look through” this spell of low interest rates, rather like other central banks in advanced economies have done. I say that because the slack price pressures in the euro area are primarily the outcome of the drop in energy prices. This decrease ought to distinctly boost growth in the euro area because its member states are net importers of oil. Another point is that the available surveys suggest that long-term inflation expectations are still well anchored. And the drops in market-based expectations don’t automatically mean that inflation expectations have contracted. Rather, they are also dictated to some extent by inflation risk and liquidity premiums. This assessment does not mean, say, that we at the Bundesbank are not being consistent with our declared primary objective of safeguarding price stability. And it most certainly does not mean that we are making this objective play second fiddle to other considerations, for instance. What it does mean is that in the face of a challenging monetary policy situation, we have reweighted economic factors and developments as well as risks, and continue to weight these factors differently than the majority of ECB Governing Council members. You will no doubt know that the ECB staff project that the inflation rate will be zero this year, rising to 1.5% and 1.8% over the next two years. They also forecast that growth will climb from 1.5% this year to 1.9% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017. This assessment is, in part, also a reflection of expectations placed in the transmission of monetary policy decisions. But my reading of the latest data and the projection is that they are more an endorsement of a restrained monetary policy response. As I see it, the projected path of inflation clearly illustrates that the spell of low or even negative inflation rates is only a temporal phenomenon. The effect of the lower oil price plays a particularly important role in this regard, and it also significantly eases the financial strain for enterprises and households. This in turn stimulates their consumption and investment activity, contributing to the expected economic recovery. And it also reduces the threat of a prolonged phase of low inflation rates possibly sparking a self-reinforcing downward spiral of fallig prices, wages, production and employment. Incidentally, I see no signs of second round effects. The collective labour agreement in the metal-working industry is largely in line with our expectation of negotiated wage rates in 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Germany climbing by roughly 3% this year. And for the other euro-area countries, too, there is nothing at the moment to suggest that the European Commission’s projection of a 1.3% increase in euro-area employee compensation this year is untenable. I am not denying that the announcement of bond purchases has further reduced the likelihood of deflation. That, at least, is what the data on inflation options seem to suggest. But the likelihood of deflation was rather remote even before the measures were announced. That’s why, on the whole, I don’t think it would have been necessary to further ease monetary policy by rolling out the broadly based government bond purchase programme. All the more so, given that the purchase of sovereign bonds in the euro area harbours specific risks, making it a monetary policy instrument unlike any other. But at least it is worth noting that the decision to largely rule out risk-sharing as part of the bond purchase programme counteracts the direct threat of sovereign credit risks being mutualised. That also diminishes the legal risk involved in that kind of programme. But the fact remains that these purchases cause fiscal policy and monetary policy to become even more strongly intertwined. For when the purchases come to an end, sovereigns will be able to finance a substantial portion of their debt very cheaply without these financing costs being differentiated in any way according to the risk of the sovereign in question. If the member states were to become accustomed to these funding terms, they might become less inclined to embrace further consolidation or reform measures. Together with the Commission’s unambitious approach to enforcing the fiscal rules, this confluence of different factors might in fact turn out to complicate efforts to resolve the euro area’s structural problems. And that might make life more difficult, further down the road, for those of us looking to achieve the target of price stability. 5.  German economy has overcome weak growth Ladies and gentlemen, after getting off to a good start in 2014, the German economy did not perform as strongly in the second half of the year as originally expected. Nevertheless, the economy appears to have emerged from its sluggish phase faster than many believed possible given, amongst other things, Germany’s buoyant economic growth towards the end of last year. The economic upturn is currently being driven by a recovery in industrial activity as well as, above all, by a decidedly positive consumer climate. The high level of employment, the favourable income prospects, the drastic fall in oil prices and the very low interest rates all promote households’ propensity to spend. In 2014, the negotiated wages of employees went up by 3% – an increase not seen in almost 20 years. In the light of the low inflation rate, real disposable incomes, too, increased considerably as a result. Enterprises benefited not only from low oil prices and favourable funding conditions, but also from the depreciation of the euro and the gradual recovery of international sales markets. As a result, enterprises increased their output on balance. Employment, too, continued to expand while unemployment levels fell. Given that the economic environment is likely to remain favourable, the reduction in unemployment can be expected to continue this year. Hence, the German economy remains in good shape. Overall, many factors point to a growth rate for 2015 that is higher than what the Bundesbank published in its December projection. As things stand, the rate of 1.5% for Germany recently provided by the European Commission is fairly realistic. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Public finances, too, show a positive picture at present. In 2014, Germany’s general government budget again recorded a slight surplus. While government expenditure was fuelled by a sharp rise in pension and healthcare costs, government interest payments again contracted significantly, chiefly thanks to the very favourable funding conditions. The fiscal balance could deteriorate somewhat in the current year. Amongst other things, this is likely a result of faster expenditure growth due, not least, to the rise in social payments resulting from the pension benefits package adopted in mid-2014. However, a slight general government surplus will again be recorded this year. Regardless of the good situation overall and the favourable economic outlook, continued risks to economic developments in Germany must not be neglected. This includes geopolitical tensions, amongst other things. What is more, the economic recovery that has got underway in the euro area remains fragile. The bottom line is that there is no room in Germany for complacency on economic policy matters. In particular, the unfavourable demographic outlook will weigh heavily on the German economy in the medium term. By 2060, the population will have shrunk by up to 20% and the labour force by around 30%. To make matters worse, policy measures such as early retirement on a full pension at 63 are already constraining the labour supply, thereby eroding growth opportunities. 6.  European banking union Ladies and gentlemen, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (or SSM), based at the ECB, has been up and running since 4 November 2014. In parallel to the introduction of the SSM, policymakers pressed ahead with efforts to create a regime for the orderly recovery and resolution of banks in 2014 without jeopardising financial stability or using taxpayers’ money, if at all possible. This project is the second pillar of the European banking union. In this context, the EU regulation establishing a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) created the two elements of this pillar: on the one hand, a European resolution board and on the other, a single bank-financed resolution fund. The SRM, which will enter into force in 2016, will apply the liability principle for banks as well. Freedom to take entrepreneurial decisions and responsibility for the consequences are to be inextricably linked here, too – and this means, if the worst comes to the worst, resolving and therefore closing a bank. Assuming they are involved at all, taxpayers will be the last to have to foot the bill, and even then only under certain conditions. However, this new joint responsibility for the resolution of banks also means that risks from the respective national private sector might be shifted to the community. This could be in the form of legislative measures which deteriorate the risk positions of banks in favour of their national debtors. For example, changes to insolvency laws, which are being discussed in some euro-area countries, could have a significant impact. I therefore believe that the banking union requires policy coordination that goes beyond the level that has been discussed so far. Overall, however, the SRM is undoubtedly a key step along the road to a more stable banking system. But neither the SSM nor the SRM will solve the fundamental problem of the, in some cases, very close ties between banks and member-state governments in the euro area. This can lead to potentially threatening interactions in a crisis event. During the crisis, distress in the banking system of some countries meant that their governments, too, faced considerable financial difficulties on account of the necessary public rescue commitments. However, this hazardous “doom loop” between banks and their sovereigns also means that sovereigns, in turn, can have a negative impact on banks. Banks 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  holding large portfolios of bonds issued by governments at risk of insolvency can be exposed to a considerable strain or even be dragged down along with them. That’s why I have repeatedly pointed out that, over the medium term, the current regulatory preferential treatment of lending to sovereigns needs to be ended or at least substantially scaled back. The aim must be to loosen the sovereign-bank nexus over the medium term. The conference “Debt and Financial Stability – Regulatory Challenges” being held by the Bundesbank and the Federal Ministry of Finance at the end of this month will therefore address this issue, too. One possible future approach could be for banks to back their claims on sovereign borrowers by capital commensurate with the risk and to subject them to large exposure limits. 7.  Privileged regulatory treatment of lending to sovereigns Ladies and gentlemen, the problems caused by the interdependencies between governments and banks take on a special form in the current regulatory framework of European monetary union. This is reflected, amongst other things, by the fact that there is often very little diversification in European banks’ loans to sovereign debtors. On the contrary, in many cases, the vast majority of the government bonds held by euro-area banks are issued by just one sovereign – their domestic government. For example, in December 2014, 98% of the loans from Greek banks to euro-area sovereign debtors were granted to the Greek government. Is it clear that in cases where the ties are so close, doubts concerning government solvency have a direct negative impact on the banking system. It is in this particular context that we have devoted the first main article of this year’s Annual Report to the topic of the sovereign-bank nexus. In particular, the article examines what would happen if sovereign loans were backed with capital, on the one hand, and if large exposures were subject to limits, on the other. Because of the potentially significant consequences, especially of the application of the large exposure limit, any reforms would require a certain transitional period. However, the macroeconomic effects of such new rules would no doubt be positive. Financial stability would be enhanced, incentives to pursue this type of fiscal policy would be increased and lending to private borrowers would become more attractive which, in turn, might boost capital stock and economies’ growth potential. It would therefore be important not to lose any time. This article should be seen as a contribution to this debate. Against this backdrop, it is a welcome development that the Basel Committee has now added the regulatory treatment of lending to sovereigns to its agenda. Furthermore, the European Systemic Risk Board published its report on this topic just the day before yesterday. In the foreword to the report, Mario Draghi quite rightly said that a discussion on the topic was long overdue. If it is not possible to reach a consensus at the international level on eliminating the privileged treatment of loans to sovereigns, we should push ahead with a European solution in order to make this important contribution to the long-term stability of the euro area. As well as focusing on major issues relating to a stability-oriented regulatory framework, the Bundesbank also takes a look at the bigger picture, including, for example, the topic of payment transactions. The second main article in this year’s Annual Report therefore examines digital structural change in payment services. 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  8.  Bundesbank profit and risk provisions Ladies and gentlemen, finally I would like to come now to our annual accounts and hence also to this year’s Bundesbank profit. The profit and loss account for the 2014 financial year closed with an annual surplus of €2.95 billion. The annual surplus for 2014 is therefore €1.6 billion below that of the previous year. The profit is lower mainly because of the significant decline in interest income last year. Net interest income came to €3.14 billion last year, which was €2.42 billion down on 2013. This decline was due, in particular, to the lower key interest rates, which were just over two-thirds lower on an annual average. With regard to risk provisions, it should be noted that the risks from monetary policy operations have grown considerably in recent years in the wake of the financial crisis. The Bundesbank had already reacted to this and, from 2010 to 2012, for the purpose of risk provisioning increased the provisions for general risks in three steps by a total of €12.4 billion. The Executive Board also reviewed the requisite level of risk provisions for 2014 – as is the case each year – and, in doing so, took into account both the current risk situation of the Bundesbank and the available financial resources. As a result of this review, the risk provisions remain unchanged at €14.4 billion (as in the previous year). There are two main reasons for not running down the risk provisions. On the one hand, the risks for the Bundesbank from the risk-weighted assets, on which attention has hitherto been focussed, have declined somewhat, since both the volume of refinancing loans from the Eurosystem and that of the securities from the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) have decreased. On the other hand, additional credit risks will arise over the next two years. These are due to the decisions of the ECB Governing Council on the purchase programmes. These chiefly refer to the Asset-Backed Securities Purchase Programme (ABSPP) from September 2014, and the Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP3). The large-scale government bond purchase programme (PSPP) that was adopted in January of this year will only have a negligible impact on the credit risks. After all, the Bundesbank primarily only purchases Federal bonds. At the same time, the cuts in the key interest rates in June and September 2014 have led to a decline in both the anticipated annual result for 2015 and in the Bundesbank’s available financial resources. In net terms, based on this overall review for 2014, no changes to the risk provisions are necessary. We transferred the annual surplus in full to the Federal Government today. The Federal Government’s Budget Act for 2015 stipulates that €2.5 billion of the Bundesbank’s profit will be used for budgetary financing, and excess amounts will be used for debt repayment. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Speech by the President at SZ Finance Day 2015 Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at SZ (Süddeutsche Zeitung) Finance Day 2015, Frankfurt am Main, 16 March 2015. *      *      * Summary Europe needs to accelerate on its way to economic and institutional convergence. Due to falling oil prices, accommodative monetary policy and successful structural reforms, we can be optimistic about the economic outlook. The nascent recovery should be used as a window of opportunity to go ahead with reforms that make the euro area less fragile and vulnerable to shocks. Economic convergence should be reached through structural reforms that lead to an alignment of productivity levels. On the institutional side, we need to move from a system of rules and guidelines for national economic policy making to a system of further sovereignty sharing within common institutions. As part of this process, we need to strengthen the democratic accountability of Europe towards its citizens. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here this evening and to be able to address this conference. We are meeting against the backdrop of a steadily recovering economic situation in the euro area. Most indicators suggest a sustained recovery is taking hold. Confidence among firms and consumers is rising. Growth forecasts have been revised upwards. And bank lending is improving on both the demand and supply sides. These improvements reflect the coming together of several external and internal factors. First, the terms of trade gains for firms and households arising from falling oil prices. Second, the monetary policy measures taken by the ECB since the middle of last year, which have led to a significant easing of financing conditions and protected the euro area from second round effects from this oil price drop, thus amplifying its benefits. And third, the successful structural reforms that have been implemented in several countries in recent years, which are now starting to produce results. These effects look set to persist for some time, meaning we can rightly be optimistic about the outlook. But this does not mean we should rest on our laurels. On the contrary, a nascent recovery provides us with a window of opportunity – with the conditions to press ahead with the reforms that will make the euro area less fragile and vulnerable to shocks. These vulnerabilities will not disappear just because the cycle is turning. They stem from the fact that our union remains incomplete along two dimensions. Neither our economies nor our institutions have converged enough. This is why whenever there is a serious shock in any part of the euro area, questions about the sustainability of the union still arise. So the current upturn in economic conditions, which the ECB has helped to generate, must be used. It provides a favourable environment to address once-and-for-all these sources of fragility at the root – and in doing so to ensure that the cyclical recovery turns into a structural one. To achieve this, we need now to press ahead with two streams of policy. First, we need to move from integration to convergence through structural reforms. And second, we need to move from rules to institutions through governance reforms. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  1. From integration to convergence In the euro area structural reforms are not a policy choice. They are a necessity that follows from the special way in which our monetary union is constructed. Let me explain why. Monetary union automatically creates economic integration as financial and trade connections deepen. But integration does not automatically lead to economic convergence, by which I mean the gradual alignment of productivity levels. This does not necessarily matter if the monetary union is of a sort where fiscal transfers are foreseen. Then, growth can cluster in certain regions, and the cohesion of the union can be maintained by transfers from those richer regions to the poorer ones. In the US, for example, a $1 decrease in per capita income in a state/region is associated with a roughly 20–40 cent net transfer from the federal government to its residents, with the bulk of the adjustment occurring through the tax system. But lack of convergence does matter if fiscal transfers are not foreseen. In this case, cohesion depends on every state producing enough growth to support its citizens’ welfare. Otherwise, citizens in poorer regions will start to question whether they might be better off outside the union. And that creates self-fulfilling fragmentation, which has repercussions across the union from which all countries ultimately suffer. The euro area falls squarely into this second category of monetary unions. It was not created to have permanent creditors and debtors. It was created with the expectation that countries would be able to stand on their own two feet, without continuous help from others. Therefore, there has to be convergence for the union to be sustainable – every economy needs to be able to meet the highest standards in terms of competitiveness, employment and growth. This imperative has always been understood in principle in the euro area. But it has not always been followed through in practice, as we see with the divergence in the euro area today. This creates an uncertain half-way position. We have now integrated too much to even entertain reversing the process – our economies are far too intertwined. But we have not yet converged enough to dispel doubts about the cohesion of our union and guarantee its long-term stability. So there is only one answer: we have to make our economies more convergent than they are today. And it is in this context that structural reforms are so important. Only with those reforms can we create the conditions where every country can allocate resources efficiently, exploit comparative advantages and grow. And I do not say this from theory, but from our own experience. We have already seen in the euro area that convergence cannot be sustained if it is not structurally anchored. We had rapid convergence in nominal GDP levels before the crisis, but driven by demand and without an underlying alignment in productivity levels. When the cycle turned, those nominal gains largely reversed. Moreover, we are seeing now how convergence can gradually restart when the right structural policies are in place. Those countries that undertook reforms in recent years are starting to see the positive effects come through. For example, the OECD estimates that the 2012 labour market reform – and in particular the decentralisation of wage bargaining – was responsible for a 3.2% decline in labour costs in the business sector up to the second quarter of 2013, a period where Spain was also able to gain large export market shares. In Portugal, well targeted and efficient active labour market policies have been able to explain about one-third of the employment recovery. And the fact we now have an extremely accommodative monetary policy is not a disincentive for countries to continue with these reforms. For example, Italy has introduced a major labour 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  market reform since the ECB announced its most recent measures. In fact, monetary policy creates an incentive for reform. Any country that does structural reforms today will see the benefits materialise faster, as those reforms will strengthen the impact of monetary policy in their economy, in particular where there is pent-up investment demand. And this in turn will make further structural reforms easier, as in a stronger economy the short-term costs of reform are lower – for instance because transitions between jobs are faster and there is less risk of hysteresis effects. 2. From rules to institutions Still, what adds fragility to our union is the fact that, despite the crucial importance of structural reforms, they remain almost entirely a national responsibility. From the moment countries enter monetary union there is no way to guarantee that they will stay fit enough to thrive within it. In my view this has to change. Because the cohesion of the euro area depends on all countries prospering, what happens within each one is not just a national interest, it is a collective interest. Every member of the euro area has a vital interest in ensuring that its partners are meeting the membership requirements – and not just at the point of entry, but continuously. Indeed, it is sometimes asked what differentiates the euro area from a fixed exchange rate regime, and the answer is precisely this point. In a fixed exchange rate regime issues of economic integration are dealt with as foreign affairs. In a monetary union, they are domestic issues for all. And it follows from this that we need a higher degree of institutional convergence in the structural domain as well. So what does this mean in practice? Up to now, we have employed two different methods of economic governance in the EU. In some areas, we have given European institutions executive power. This includes the ECB for monetary policy, the SSM (within the ECB) for financial policy, and the Commission for competition policy. In other areas, executive power has remained at the national level, with policies being aligned through a system of rules enforced by the Commission. This is the case for fiscal and economic policies. There are of course good reasons why those different methods have been applied. But if we reflect honestly, which would we say has been most successful? I think few would deny that where European institutions have been invested with executive power, they have used it well. Competition policy has been effective with both large companies and large countries. Monetary policy has achieved a high degree of policy credibility. And for the SSM it is perhaps too early to judge, though I am certain we would not have had such a rigorous clean-up of our banking sector without it. If we look at the rules-based approach, however, it is difficult to reach such a positive conclusion. The fiscal rules have repeatedly been broken and trust between countries has been strained. And for economic policies we have tried to introduce a new rules-based approach – the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure – but it has so far not gained much traction in national decision-making processes. The discrepancy between these two methods does not arise because of any inherent difference in the quality of European and national authorities. It arises because of the inherent difference between rules and institutions in a monetary union. And there are two reasons why I think, going forward, an institution-based approach would work better for the governance of structural reforms. First, institutions facilitate both more credible and more flexible policymaking. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Rules can only really be credible if they are applied with very little discretion. Otherwise as soon as they actually bind, countries will find reasons not to follow them. But having no discretion is also not optimal, as circumstances will always arise that the rules did not foresee. There is thus an inevitable trade-off between credibility and flexibility. Indeed, this is why we often end up in a difficult balancing act in Europe – trying at once to be flexible with the rules in the short-term to reflect circumstances, but rigid with the rules over the medium-term to build credibility. And ultimately we run the risk that this creates inconsistency between countries, which in turn weakens trust. By contrast, for European institutions the trade-offs are less. Their policies are credible because they are bound by a mandate. But at the same time they can use discretion over how they meet that mandate, allowing flexibility to respond to events. This “constrained discretion” describes exactly the ECB’s response to unprecedented low inflation: we did not have discretion over whether to meet our mandate, but we exercised it over how to do so. I recognise that for structural reforms the analogy with monetary policy is not perfect. Preferences are not as aligned across countries and it would not be possible to have such a complete delegation of powers. But I am confident that a European institution could help on two fronts. Making it easier to agree on the aims of structural reforms by aligning best practice. And making it easier to implement them by using European law to bypass vested interests. It is clear, however, that the more European governance extends into areas such as economic policies, the more we need strong democratic participation and accountability at the European level. There are fundamental distributional questions at stake with structural reforms that cannot simply be delegated to technocratic bodies. And this is where the second reason for an institutional approach comes in – institutions with executive power create clearer and more direct accountability. In the euro area both governments and the Commission are in principle accountable for implementing the rules. But in practice it is often the case that governments claim little ownership over this process, diverting responsibility for the outcome to the Commission. Yet at the same time the Commission has limited powers in this domain. With effective European institutions, however, it is possible to make a more direct link between decisions and responsibility. Precisely because those institutions are invested with defined powers, citizens can hold them accountable against their mandate. And in fact, strengthening these channels of democratic participation is vital for the euro area today. It is exactly the impression that there is too little accountability in Europe that populist parties often exploit. In sum, my conclusion is that there must be a quantum leap in institutional convergence. We need to move from a system of rules and guidelines for national economic policy making, to a system of further sovereignty sharing within common institutions. And as part of this process we need to strengthen the democratic accountability of Europe towards its citizens, which would automatically deepen our political union. Let me however be clear: in the absence of institutions, rules act as a crucial anchor for confidence. So there is no question that the rules can be ignored because institutions would be better. On the contrary, they have to be fully respected so that we can make such a transition in the future. We have to build trust today by showing that what we agree to, we honour. And then we take the next steps forward as credible partners for each other. Conclusion Let me conclude. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The euro area has advanced a long way as a monetary union. We began with a single market, a single currency and a single monetary policy. We now have a single supervisor and resolution authority. And soon we will have a single capital market. But we have not yet advanced far enough to put all questions about our future to bed. We need to remove those lingering doubts that resurface whenever a shock hits. And to do so we have to accelerate both our economic and institutional convergence. Our monetary policy is helping to make this possible by creating an improving cyclical environment. But it is now up to governments to seize on this opportunity and make those improvements permanent. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Már Guðmundsson: Recent economic and financial developments in Iceland Speech by Mr Már Guðmundsson, Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, at the 54th Annual General Meeting of the Central Bank of Iceland, Reykjavík, 26 March 2015. *      *      * Mr. President; Speaker of Parliament, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, Minister of the Interior, Directors, and Ambassadors; Ladies and Gentlemen: We have come together today for the 54th Annual General Meeting of the Central Bank of Iceland. When we met for the Bank’s Annual Meeting five years ago, the Icelandic economy was at the bottom of the economic recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008. The future was highly uncertain. Had the economy hit bottom? How strong would the upswing be? How much would the unemployment rate fall? Would we be able to bring inflation back to target and keep it there? How would the sizeable debt owed by Iceland’s central government, households, firms, and the national economy evolve? How would the newly established domestic-oriented banks fare? Was Iceland’s external position sustainable? When and how would we manage to lift the comprehensive capital controls that proved necessary during the crisis? In my speech at that meeting five years ago, I listed three challenges that, in my view, the Icelandic authorities faced under the conditions then prevailing. What I said was this: First, it is critical to allow the economy to adjust without allowing inflation or unemployment to become entrenched. The goal is a situation in which economic slack has disappeared, economic growth is in line with growth in potential output, inflation is at the target, and the external position of the economy is sustainable. Second, we must establish a financial system that serves Icelandic households and domestic business activities and is both efficient and relatively secure. The third challenge is that of re-establishing confidence abroad in Iceland’s institutional framework, economy, and financial system; repairing the connections with foreign financial markets; and ensuring that the Icelandic Government and Icelandic companies have access to foreign credit markets once again. The economic recovery was just about to begin when the 2010 meeting was held. It then gained enough momentum that, in five years’ time, we have returned to pre-crisis GDP levels and have eliminated virtually all of the spare capacity in the economy. At the same time, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply and is now close to its equilibrium value. Structural reforms could reduce the equilibrium unemployment rate still further in the future, however. Inflation is below the inflation target at present, and inflation expectations had subsided to target by the turn of the year. Treasury debt has declined steadily since 2011, and the outlook is for this trend to continue in the years to come. Household and corporate debt levels have also declined markedly. The ratio of household debt to disposable income is now roughly at 2005 levels, and the ratio of corporate debt to GDP is at its lowest since mid-2004. Iceland’s external position has proven to be sustainable. The trade surplus has been around 8% of GDP since 2009. This is the longest continuous period with a surplus over 5 % of GDP in the history of the data, which extend back to 1875. The current account balance as a whole has averaged 5.5% of GDP per year; that is, excluding the effects of the failed banks and other factors that do not reflect Iceland’s financial burden. The current account balance has reduced Iceland’s debt, cutting underlying net external debt almost in half since year-end 2008, to about 45% of GDP by the end of 2014. But all of this does not change the fact that Iceland still faces a balance of payments problem, which is reflected in the fact that a too large share of its debt is too short-term, and a part of the debt takes the form of possibly volatile ISK assets held by non-residents. This situation could put substantial pressure on the 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  exchange rate or the Central Bank’s foreign exchange reserves if these ISK assets were free to exit the country. The three new commercial banks have also performed well in a number of areas, as can be seen in various indicators, including their capital ratios, which have risen from a 2009 average of 16% to last year’s average of nearly 29%. The initial foreign currency mismatches in their balance sheets have been reduced are now within the limits provided for in Central Bank rules, and their domestic and foreign liquidity positions have improved. But the banks are operating in the shelter of the capital controls, and looking ahead, questions concerning their size and efficiency remain to some extent unanswered. Many factors have been favourable for us in spite of global headwinds, which were initially reflected in a marked deterioration in terms of trade and are still reflected in a weak economic recovery among our trading partners. Looking back at the three challenges I mentioned a moment ago, we can say in broad terms that the macroeconomic goals have been met thus far. The financial system now stands on much more solid ground. It is primarily in connection with the third challenge, of reintegrating Iceland into international capital markets, that more work needs to be done. But even in this area we have made significant progress. GDP growth, a balanced economy, a Treasury surplus, and the Central Bank’s foreign currency purchases have created good conditions for the liberalisation of the capital controls. The credit ratings of the sovereign and the commercial banks have improved. The sovereign regained access to foreign credit markets some time ago, and the banks have opened a crack in the door. But even though we have made significant progress, the game is not yet won. Debt levels are high, rendering borrowers vulnerable to shocks, and the capital controls are still in place. Iceland’s macroeconomic balance is good, but fragile. On this score, we face three relatively important risks: first, that the interactions between labour market unrest and the turnaround from output slack to a positive output gap could undermine price stability and turn the current account surplus into a deficit; second, that lifting the capital controls could turn out badly, with negative implications for exchange rate stability, inflation, and financial system stability; and third, that the global economic situation could turn against us. Therefore, we must avoid complacency, and we must be vigilant if we are to safeguard our recently achieved stability and face down the three challenges that I have mentioned just now. In some respects, formulating monetary policy is complex at present, as it has been at times in the past. The Central Bank’s interest rates were lowered by 0.75 percentage points in the final two months of 2014, in response to rapidly falling inflation and the decline of inflation expectations to the target. Since then, inflation has dropped still further, falling below 1% in December, triggering the submittal of a report to the Government on inflation below the deviation threshold. Even though inflation is now below 1%, the Central Bank’s key interest rate has been unchanged at 4.5% so far this year. There are a number of reasons for this. First of all, the extremely low inflation rate is due partly to the abrupt drop in global oil and commodity prices in the second half of 2014. This drop could prove temporary, but even if not, it is beyond the scope of domestic monetary policy. Furthermore, it can be assumed that real wages will rise if the decline in oil prices proves long-lived, but the impact on inflation will taper off. Second, the inflation outlook is clouded by various domestic uncertainties. The slack in the economy is turning around into a positive output gap. There is far more unrest in the labour market than might be expected in view of overall macroeconomic conditions and supply and demand in the labour market. In regards to the inflation outlook, the most important factor is that some groups have demanded extremely large pay increases that would set inflation in motion again and call for a strong monetary policy response if they extended to the labour market as a whole. The third reason is that inflation expectations, which had subsided to target at the beginning of the year, have risen again in recent weeks, probably due to the unrest in the labour market. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The labour market situation is both thought-provoking and a source of concern. Wage pressures that jeopardise the inflation target are generally interpreted as a sign of a positive output gap and excess labour demand, which call for a tighter monetary stance. Yet a number of factors indicate that this is not the main explanation for the current situation. Instead, it appears that the consensus on wage differentials has been weakened at the same time that opening of the labour market vis-à-vis abroad has put pressure on wage differentials – in some cases, in the direction opposite to that demanded by labour market organisations. As Monetary Policy Committee member Gylfi Zoëga pointed out recently, the greater the sense of cohesion about wage distribution in society, the lower the unemployment rate that is consistent with low and stable inflation. Conversely, the weaker that sense of cohesion, the less individual worker groups will be willing to participate in creating the public good that is price stability, and the higher the equilibrium unemployment rate will have to be. This theory is based partly on the work of Ezio Tarantelli, one of Italy’s leading economists in the second half of the twentieth century, which shows us that our experience is far from unique. If the theory applies to the current situation in Iceland – and a number of factors indicate that it does – increased cohesion in this sense could create the conditions for lower unemployment and lower interest rates, but without losing control of inflation. Whatever the reason, this situation gives rise to the risk of an outcome that is worse for society as a whole, although some groups may gain at others’ expense. In other words, in this situation as in so many others, a cooperative solution is usually better for the whole than a conflict solution. Therefore, it is extremely important that the parties involved – particularly the social partners and the Government – make every effort to push matters in that direction. It is important that the decisions taken in wage negotiations over the next several months be based on correct information. The report published jointly by the social partners last month, entitled In the Prelude to Wage Negotiations, contains cogent information on wage developments in recent years. According to the report, the emphasis placed on the lowest wages in recent years has borne fruit, at least in part. For example, office workers’ and general labourers’ wages rose most during the period from 2006 through 2014, and they rose in excess of the general wage index. The report also confirms what has previously been reported, that wages and productivity per hour worked are relatively low in comparison with trading partner countries and that Icelandic workers compensate somewhat for this with longer working hours. This highlights the fact that, in the long run, increased productivity is the premise for higher real wages. In this context, the weak productivity growth in recent years could give some cause for concern. On the other hand, it also reflects the growth of labour-intensive sectors such as tourism, which have been supported by the low real exchange rate and have facilitated a more rapid decline in unemployment than would otherwise have been possible. It also explains in part why unemployment among young people is – fortunately – much lower in Iceland than in many of our trading partners. When full employment is achieved, productivity growth will become more important, however. If attempts to ease the tension in the labour market are unsuccessful and wages rise far more than is consistent with the inflation target, it will be unavoidable to respond by tightening the monetary stance; i.e., by raising interest rates. Even if inflation rises early on, the Monetary Policy Committee has the tools it needs to bring it back to target over the medium term. Higher interest rates will have a negative effect on GDP growth and employment over time, however. Real wages and the real exchange rate will rise because of the interactions between rising nominal wages and a tighter monetary stance. In addition, firms would probably respond by slowing down recruitment – perhaps even by cutting back on staff. There is the risk that such a turn of events would be most harmful to labour-intensive sectors and workers whose position in the labour market is weakest. It is therefore important to find ways to channel the desire to improve standards of living towards measures 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  that are likely to generate more lasting results without jeopardising stability and the economic recovery that has brought us this far. Honoured guests: The time for decisive steps towards lifting the capital controls is rapidly approaching. Some may think this step comes rather late. This is quite understandable. And there is no reason to soft-pedal the fact that the capital controls are harmful to the Icelandic economy. It is difficult to make a sufficiently accurate estimate of the magnitude of the negative effects, and I am not sure that the assessments made thus far would all stand up to close examination. One thing we do know, however: the detrimental effects escalate as time passes. But we must understand the nature and scope of the problem if we are to make a reasonably fair assessment of the time that has passed and of how quickly the controls can be lifted. In this context, I have found it helpful to explain to foreign observers that the collective collapse of Iceland’s three large banks is thought be the third-largest bankruptcy in history. The Lehman bankruptcy was larger, and its settlement is not complete. Our own settlement is taking place in one of the smallest countries in the world and is associated with a severe balance of payments problem, whereas in the case of Lehman, balance of payments problems have relatively little relevance. Another point that I make is that if all of the estates’ króna-denominated assets were added to the current stock of offshore krónur, the combined stock would increase to about half of GDP. Of course, we will not let that happen, but if it did, the new “overhang” would be much larger in proportional terms than the UK’s post-war sterling overhang, which totalled nearly a third of its GDP. It took the British over four decades to lift the capital controls that were imposed partly for this reason. The most usual way to describe the problem is to consider the capital that is likely to seek an exit as soon as the controls are lifted. This includes the failed banks’ estates, the potentially volatile ISK assets held by non-residents – usually called offshore krónur – and possible outflows from Icelandic residents as well. In this context, we are best equipped to predict what would happen if the controls were lifted from the estates without any mitigating measures, as we have mapped out the estates in infinitesimal detail. There is greater uncertainty about the offshore krónur. Following the Bank’s foreign currency auctions in the past few years, some of the remaining capital could be held by patient investors, as some of the parties behind it swear faithfully that it is. But it is safer to verify and secure this before we open the exit doors wide, and there are ways to do it. The greatest uncertainty centres on potential outflows from residents. To a degree, it is possible to estimate resident investors’ need to increase the share of foreign assets in their portfolios, but naturally, they may undertake such foreign investments at varying tempos. The most important factor either way is the level of confidence in Iceland and its financial system at the time the controls are lifted, which is obviously an unknown at this point. It will also be a major determinant of potential inflows from non-residents at the same time. It is precisely one of the key factors in preparing for liberalisation to facilitate the recognition of Iceland as a sound, trustworthy investment option, and that resident investors – and not only the sovereign – have access to foreign credit markets on sustainable terms. Under current conditions, this means that we need an economy that is growing and is in equilibrium, both internally and externally. We need a Treasury surplus, and we need to reduce the Treasury debt ratio. We need strong enough national saving to support a normal investment level. Given the current outlook for investment, this means we must have a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments. We need large enough foreign exchange reserves to sustain the confidence of foreign lenders, maintain our credit ratings, and cushion us against volatility. We need a banking system that is solid and resilient. As I mentioned earlier, we are doing well in many of these areas, and the conditions exist for further improvements during the current year. The extension of the maturity of Landsbankinn’s debt to the old bank (LBI), which was finally negotiated towards the end of last year, has improved the situation. It enhances the possibility of expanding the foreign 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  exchange reserves and increasing the portion not funded with foreign credit. In 2014, the Bank was a net purchaser of foreign currency in the amount of 111 b.kr. So far this year, it has bought currency for 30 b.kr., as opposed to 21 b.kr. over the same period in 2014. If it maintains that pace, it will buy more currency in 2015 than in 2014. As a result, the reserves exceed the outstanding foreign-denominated loans taken to finance them – by 65 b.kr. as of the end of February. But we mustn’t rest on our laurels; we need sizeable reserves as we prepare to lift the capital controls. I mentioned uncertainty surrounding the estimation of potential FX outflows once the controls are lifted. But one thing is certain: if the failed banks’ estates were given a green light tomorrow and could convert all of their krónur to foreign currency, and the same happened with the offshore overhang, there is no way we could safeguard stability, let alone bolster confidence, except perhaps after a long time has elapsed. The Central Bank of Iceland has designed a model intended to assess the impact of various developments in the balance of payments over a long horizon, including capital account liberalisation measures. When applied to this instance, the model reveals that our entire foreign exchange reserves would be wiped out – and more besides – if they were used to shore up the exchange rate. This would never be done, of course, and therefore the currency would depreciate sharply. It is clear that if residents were free to exit at the same time, they would participate in the run on the currency, and confidence would evaporate quickly, leaving us with a new currency crisis to grapple with. Of course, this is an extreme scenario in some respects, as the estates’ ISK assets, for instance, are not all liquid at this point in time, and a portion of the offshore krónur could be patient capital. But it gives an indication of the kind of problem we are dealing with. Therefore, we need other solutions that safeguard stability and prevent additional burdens from being placed on the sovereign or the Icelandic people. Such solutions do exist, and a large group of experts – foreign consultants; the task force for capital account liberalisation, which works for the steering committee on the capital controls; and experts from the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs – has been working hard on developing them in recent months. I would like to take a moment now and thank all of these people for their tireless efforts and excellent work. It would be premature to publicise solutions at today’s meeting. Moreover, it is not within my purview to do so on my own. The liberalisation of the capital controls is a collaborative project undertaken by the Central Bank and the Government, which actually means that elected representatives have the last word on the actions taken – particularly if and when tools are used that are not in the Bank’s toolbox. Honoured guests: I have spoken at some length on monetary policy and the labour market, on the one hand, and the capital controls, on the other. But I have done so with a purpose, as these are by far the greatest economic challenges facing us at the moment. Yet the Central Bank’s sphere of activity includes many other functions as well, not least those centring on the structure and stability of the financial system. Let us hope that, when we convene a year from now for the Central Bank of Iceland’s 55th Annual General Meeting, we will have resolved successfully the urgent issues now facing us and can turn our attentions to these other areas of activity. In the field of financial stability, emphasis has been on the risks related to the capital controls and on the formulation and implementation of the prudential rules that, in our opinion, must be in place once the controls are lifted. That work is well underway. And as regards risk assessment and contingency planning, the Systemic Risk Committee and the Financial Stability Council will be meeting next month, and the Central Bank’s Financial Stability report is scheduled for publication on 22 April. Honoured guests: As the Chairman of the Supervisory Board mentioned in his speech, the Central Bank was relatively successful in working towards its goals in 2014. In addition, a great deal of work was done to ensure the efficacy of the capital controls, the smooth 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  operation of financial system infrastructure, and the recovery of legacy assets from the crisis, among other things. This would not have been possible without the competent and hard-working people employed by the Bank. I wish to thank you all for your efforts. In this context, I would like to stress how important it is that, whatever amendments may be made to the Central Bank Act, the Bank must remain a strong institution capable of safeguarding monetary and financial stability in Iceland. In order to do so, it must have the independence to apply its policy instruments to this end. It must also be a professionally strong and vigorous workplace where senior management and staff members have a dynamic interactive relationship on matters relating to operations, analysis, and policy formulation. In closing, I would like to thank the Central Bank’s many collaborators for a successful cooperative relationship over the past year, in particular the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and the Financial Supervisory Authority. I thank the financial institutions with which the Bank interacts for their cooperation. I would also like to thank the Parliament of Iceland, particularly the Economics and Commerce Committee, for their collaboration. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Chris Salmon: Remarks given at the first meeting of the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates Remarks by Mr Chris Salmon, Executive Director for Markets of the Bank of England, at the first meeting of the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates, London, 18 March 2015. *      *      * Over the past two and a half years, the Bank of England has been firmly committed to benchmark reform. Much has already been achieved by regulators, administrators and market participants. Those achievements include the Wheatley Review of Libor, the development of IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks, the FSB’s recommendations on interest rate benchmark reform, and most recently the extension of the UK regulatory framework to cover additional critical benchmarks – including the interest rate benchmarks, SONIA and RONIA. But there is still much to do. The way ahead was signposted in the July 2014 Financial Stability Board Report, “Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks”. That Report recommended a “multi-rate” approach involving the strengthening of existing “IBOR” rates (such as LIBOR) by using, to the greatest extent possible, transactions data; and developing alternative near risk-free reference rates (RFRs) for use in derivatives contracts. The FSB’s recommendation to develop alternative reference rates alongside LIBOR recognises that there are, broadly speaking, two main applications for benchmark interest rates: (i) as reference rates in credit products, including bank loans, thereby helping banks to hedge their unsecured funding costs; and (ii) as reference rates in derivatives contracts, whose users are likely to be seeking to hedge exposure to the general level of interest rates, or to hedge secured funding costs. LIBOR originated as a reference rate for bank loans, and became the dominant reference rate in interest rate swap contracts because it was already the major established reference rate at the time the swap market developed. However market participants’ input to the FSB report suggested that many users of derivatives would prefer not to have exposure to banks’ term funding costs through LIBOR swaps, and would instead prefer those contracts to reference a near risk-free rate. This change will not happen spontaneously – liquidity in long-dated swaps is firmly concentrated in contracts referencing LIBOR and no individual player can change that situation. What is required is a collective effort to change market practice. That is why we have initiated the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates. It will be tasked with identifying a suitable near risk-free reference rate for sterling markets, and formulating a transition plan to catalyse a change in market practice so that a significant portion of derivatives contracts reference the new RFR rather than LIBOR. I believe that this is a critical component of the interest rate benchmark reform agenda. Structure of the group The Working Group we have initiated today is a private-sector group comprised of senior subject matter experts from major sterling swap dealers. Participation is at the invitation of the Bank of England, and we have convened this particular group because our experience of derivatives reform suggests that the swap dealer community can be most influential in catalysing a transition. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It will of course be necessary to reach out to a wide range of stakeholders – but the commitment to change must originate from this group, and this group is best placed to promote adoption amongst the swap user community. In particular, we expect that you will reach out to CCPs, exchanges, benchmark administrators, and end users – including institutional investors and corporate treasures. The Bank is prepared to facilitate this outreach process by hosting roundtable meetings at the request of the Working Group. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association will participate in a non-voting capacity and provide guidance on contract robustness and reference rate transition. Representatives from the Bank of England and the FCA will participate as ex-officio members. The Bank will also provide a secretariat, host meetings, and publish the terms of reference of the Group, meeting agendas and minutes on our website.1 Aims of the group and timeline The rest is up to you. The first task for the Group is to identify the most appropriate near risk-free reference rate for sterling markets. Alongside that you will consider how contracts referencing the rate can be made robust to changes in market structure. We expect these discussions to reach a conclusion during the third quarter of this year. The Group will then develop an adoption and transition plan over the remainder of 2015, considering the factors that could facilitate adoption of the chosen RFR, as well as metrics of success and a timeline for the transition process. It is anticipated that firms participating in the Working Group will sign letters of agreement to support adoption of the chosen RFR, referencing these metrics. Implementation is expected to begin in 2016. We believe that this needs to be a market-driven process and that the choice of RFR is yours to make. However, this is not an academic exercise. A “choice” means that you will be prepared to make meaningful transition commitments over a 12 to 24 month horizon. Bank of England data collection initiative Before I hand over to you all to begin the important work of this Group, I want to make you aware of a new initiative the Bank is embarking on, aimed at enhancing our measures of overnight interest rates in sterling markets. The Bank has a special interest in monitoring the overnight money market because it is a key aim of monetary policy to influence conditions in that market. Understanding developments in money markets is a crucial part of the Bank’s assessment of monetary and financial conditions. It is therefore of considerable importance to the Bank that robust, transparent measures of overnight interest rates are available. It is also in the interests of sterling markets more broadly that robust benchmarks are available. The two main existing sterling overnight benchmark interest rates, SONIA and RONIA, are based on the rates paid respectively on unsecured and secured deposits placed via brokers. The volume of transactions underpinning these benchmarks has fallen significantly in recent years, reflecting reduced money market activity as well as a decline in brokers’ share of that activity. The decline in transactions volumes raises questions about the long-term robustness of these benchmarks. That is of particular concern in respect of SONIA, which forms the basis of the sterling overnight indexed swap market, and is referenced in contracts with a gross notional outstanding value in excess of £13tn.                                                 1  See http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/sterlingoperations/rfr/rfr.aspx. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In our view there is a clear need for a more secure and broad-based source of transactions data to support robust overnight benchmark interest rates in sterling markets. Accordingly, we have reached the conclusion that the Bank of England should collect each day, from banks and building societies active in sterling money markets, data on their sterling overnight deposit transactions. The purpose of this data collection is to secure and improve the information available to the Bank on conditions in money markets, benefiting our analysis of both monetary policy and financial stability. We have written to around 30 banks who we will ask to participate in this data collection exercise. The Bank and the Financial Conduct Authority are in discussion with the Wholesale Market Brokers Association, the administrator of SONIA, regarding the future evolution of that benchmark. We believe that the data we plan to collect should, in time, play an important part in providing firmer foundations for this existing benchmark. Clearly a stronger overnight unsecured benchmark will be a more attractive candidate RFR than is SONIA in its current form. However I want to be clear that the Bank will pursue this data-collection initiative regardless of the outcome of your discussions on RFRs, since we believe it to be necessary for our own monetary policy purposes, and because it is in the interests of sterling markets more broadly to have robust benchmark interest rates in sterling markets. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Fritz Zurbrügg: After the minimum exchange rate – new monetary policy challenges Speech by Mr Fritz Zurbrügg, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Money Market Event, Zurich, 26 March 2015. *      *      * The speaker would like to thank Dirk Faltin for his valuable support in preparing this speech. He also thanks Marco Huwiler and Peter Kuster for helpful comments. Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. Ladies and gentlemen A warm welcome to our traditional Money Market Event in Zurich. We are delighted that so many of you accepted our invitation to attend. A year ago at this gathering, I spoke to you about the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) investment policy. At the time, I touched only peripherally on monetary policy and the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. It will come as no surprise to you that this year I have decided to devote my talk exclusively to monetary policy. On 15 January of this year, the SNB discontinued the minimum exchange rate to the euro. This step attracted a good deal of attention around the globe and triggered dramatic price movements on the financial markets for a short time. It has significant implications for large sections of Switzerland’s economy. For the SNB, too, the decision to discontinue the minimum exchange rate was a momentous one. I would like to take this opportunity to explain our rationale for discontinuing the minimum exchange rate in more detail. In doing so, I shall also outline the consequences of this decision for the economic outlook and price developments in Switzerland. Let me start by reminding you of the circumstances surrounding the introduction of the minimum exchange rate in September 2011. After my presentation, my colleague Dewet Moser will brief us on this latest chapter in monetary policy implementation. From financial crisis to minimum exchange rate The international financial crisis started almost eight years ago. In August 2007, extreme tensions became evident on the money market. Central banks in the advanced economies countered these developments by lowering key interest rates and expanded the liquidity supply to the interbank markets. As the banking crisis increasingly broadened into a wider financial and economic crisis, demand for safe investments – and hence also for Swiss francs – increased rapidly. From the end of the year, the franc came under substantial upward pressure (cf. chart 1). Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in autumn 2008, central banks quickly reduced short-term interest rates to unprecedented lows. At the beginning of 2009, the SNB lowered the target range for the three-month Libor to between 0% and 0.75%. The one-week repo rate, which is used to steer the Libor, had already been close to zero since the end of 2008. Conventional monetary policy – that is to say, the steering of the economy via short-term interest rates – had thus come up against its limits. However, fears that monetary policy had run out of options were unfounded. Central banks in the advanced economies increasingly began to resort to unconventional instruments. At the SNB, these included long-term repos, purchases of Swiss franc-denominated bonds issued by domestic, private-sector borrowers and interventions in the foreign exchange market. It is worth noting that the SNB had intervened only very rarely in the foreign exchange markets between the early 1980s and 2009. And on the occasions when it had, the SNB’s interventions had typically been small-scale and had been coordinated with the Group of Ten central banks. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  This changed in March 2009, when, having reduced the short-term interest rate to near zero, the SNB began purchasing foreign exchange in an effort to counter upward pressure on the Swiss franc and prevent an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions. The first escalation in the euro area debt crisis in the spring of 2010 required the SNB to make extensive foreign currency purchases; these were provisionally halted in June 2010 once the economic recovery had gained a foothold. In the first half of 2011, the situation in the euro area took another turn for the worse. Other euro area countries were being dragged into the crisis. The global economic outlook deteriorated and uncertainty on the financial markets was compounded by the US budget dispute. Upward pressure on the Swiss franc was immense at this time. In August 2011, the real export-weighted Swiss franc exchange rate was 40% above its long-term average (cf. chart 2). In August 2011, in an attempt to counter the exceptionally strong Swiss franc, the SNB narrowed the target range for the Libor to between 0.0% and 0.25%, aiming to keep it as close to zero as possible. It also took steps to expand banks’ sight deposits significantly.1 These measures were successful up to a point, however in the light of ongoing uncertainty on the financial markets and more bad news from the euro area, upward pressure on the Swiss franc remained high and became more intense still at the beginning of September 2011. The SNB therefore decided to provide the foreign exchange market with clear guidance in the form of a minimum exchange rate for the franc against the euro. On 6 September 2011, it announced that it would no longer tolerate a EUR/CHF exchange rate below CHF 1.20. This exceptional measure enabled the SNB to take a stand against an acute threat to the Swiss economy and to counter the risk of a deflationary trend emanating from the massive overvaluation of the Swiss franc. The minimum exchange rate was introduced as a temporary, emergency measure in a time of extreme turbulence. The franc remained high in the period that followed, yet deflation risk was held in check. Moreover, the minimum exchange rate bought Swiss companies – especially exporters and industries facing competition from imports – some time in which to plan their next steps in a very difficult operating environment. Discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate The minimum exchange rate has undoubtedly served Switzerland well during an exceptional period. However, the old adage popular among economists – “there’s no such thing as a free lunch” – holds true for monetary policy as well. The SNB Governing Board was well aware that the introduction of a minimum exchange rate would entail certain risks – and we consistently alluded to these. That the SNB would have to make large foreign currency purchases and expand its currency reserves in order to enforce the minimum exchange rate was thus to be expected. The SNB must be willing to bear these risks if doing so is necessary for the fulfilment of its legal mandate, and if these risks are justified given the chances of success. We enforced the minimum exchange rate consistently for more than three years (6 September 2011 to 15 January 2015). At the peak of the euro crisis in 2012, the SNB had to purchase CHF 188 billion of foreign currency. Adding this to purchases from prior years reveals that the SNB’s currency reserves rose from CHF 50.5 billion in 2007 to                                                 1  In August 2011, the SNB announced that it would very significantly increase the supply of liquidity to the Swiss franc money market by expanding banks’ sight deposits at the SNB from CHF 30 billion to CHF 80 billion within a few days. Shortly afterwards, the SNB decided once again to increase banks’ sight deposits substantially, to CHF 120 billion; this step was followed by a further – final – increase, this time to CHF 200 billion. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  CHF 432.2 billion at the end of 2012 (cf. chart 3), proving beyond doubt that the SNB is willing to accept balance sheet risks in order to enforce its monetary policy. Last year, the SNB’s shareholders, the Confederation and the cantons all learned that these risks can have real consequences. For the year 2013, for the first time in its history, the SNB was unable to pay any dividends or distribute any profit, as the fall in the gold price and exchange rate-related losses had led to a very negative annual result. As you might expect, this decision was not greeted with rapturous applause. However, the critical point here is that the principles of the SNB’s profit distribution agreement were not called into question. People generally recognised and accepted the fact that a larger balance sheet goes hand in hand with higher potential loss. Despite having successfully enforced the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro for several years, in January 2015 the SNB concluded that the measure had become untenable and was therefore no longer justified from a monetary policy point of view. What led to this far-reaching reassessment? Let us briefly re-wind to 2014. While in the US expectations of an interest rate rise were mounting, there were signs of further monetary policy easing in the euro area from mid-year onwards. The euro subsequently weakened significantly against the US dollar. This in turn affected the EUR/CHF rate, which had already been close to the minimum exchange rate for some time. As a result, the Swiss franc largely followed the euro downwards. Nevertheless, at the mid-December monetary policy assessment, we were still convinced that the minimum exchange rate was the right instrument for ensuring appropriate monetary conditions. Shortly thereafter, however, the euro depreciation gathered pace sharply, and pressure on the franc increased dramatically. It became clear that a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro was no longer tenable. Only sustained currency market interventions of rapidly increasing magnitude would have allowed the SNB to uphold the policy. Faced with these fundamental changes in international conditions, we came to the conclusion that the minimum exchange rate could only have been maintained through an uncontrollable expansion of the balance sheet, potentially even to a level several times higher than Swiss GDP. The risks associated with such a balance sheet expansion would have been out of all proportion to the benefits for the economy. An uncontrollable expansion of the balance sheet would have severely impaired the SNB’s ability to conduct monetary policy in the future and jeopardised the fulfilment of its mandate in the long term. On the one hand, the future use of currency interventions would have been severely constrained. On the other hand, reabsorbing this huge volume of liquidity once monetary policy began to normalise would have been very difficult and extremely costly. Communication and timing of the discontinuation The discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate took the financial markets by surprise and the price reactions on the foreign exchange and equity markets were correspondingly strong. In an age when transparency and openness in monetary policy matters are riding high, the decision to exit the minimum exchange rate policy so abruptly bewildered many observers. However, transparency is not an end in itself; it is part of monetary policy. Traditionally, monetary policy has been steered via short-term interest rates. These then feed through to exchange rates and long-term interest rates, thereby influencing – albeit with a time lag – the demand for goods and services and, ultimately, wages and prices in the economy. By communicating its intentions transparently and credibly, the SNB can influence expectations (e.g. on the financial markets), thereby rendering its monetary policy more effective. Fundamentally, we are keen to avoid surprising the economy and triggering major price movements on the financial markets with our monetary policy measures. In the context of conventional interest rate policy, it is thus advantageous to keep the gap between financial market participants’ expectations and the SNB’s actual interest rate adjustments within reasonable limits. Normally, therefore, there is no contradiction between the notion of transparent communication and our monetary policy intentions. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  But there are exceptions, and the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate – a measure that was directly linked to the foreign exchange market – is one such exception. An announcement, or even the slightest hint of an imminent decision to dispense with the minimum exchange rate, would have triggered massive speculation against the SNB. We would then have been forced to, as it was, subsidise this speculation via foreign currency purchases. Incidentally, these same arguments also explain why a gradual exit from the minimum exchange rate or a “gentle” transition to a policy involving some other form of explicit exchange rate linkage (e.g. pegging the Swiss franc to a basket of currencies) was impractical. Such a policy would likewise have opened the floodgates to speculators. There was thus no reasonable alternative to exiting the minimum exchange rate suddenly and completely. We discussed when would be the best time to communicate the decision. Our choice of the morning of 15 January was designed to allow market participants to start from a level playing field when adapting to this undoubtedly challenging new situation. By discontinuing the minimum exchange rate on a weekday when market participation was high, we minimised the risk of some banks and their customers being put at a disadvantage, or of individual participants gaining an advantage. At such a time, it would be possible for established market access channels, via electronic trading platforms or phone links to the trading desks of the main currency trading firms, to be widely used – although there were some bottlenecks immediately after the announcement. By contrast, if we had announced the move at the weekend, for instance, this would have caused uncertainty about the trading conditions when the foreign exchange market opened on Sunday evening (Swiss time). Australia, which normally accounts for only around 1% of daily turnover in Swiss franc forex operations, would have been overwhelmed by the volume of trades during its business hours. You can easily imagine that the turbulence on the Australian market would have been far greater than that observed on the morning of 15 January, with contagion potentially spreading to the entire financial market. We wanted to avoid this. Monetary policy after the minimum exchange rate So what will the minimum exchange rate discontinuation mean for monetary policy in Switzerland? First, let me emphasise that the exit from the minimum exchange rate does not mean that we will simply be a passive observer of the foreign exchange market in future. The SNB will continue to take account of the exchange rate situation in formulating its monetary policy and will intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary in order to influence monetary conditions. Nonetheless, the end of the minimum exchange rate does mean that interest rate steering will once again take on a more prominent role. In December last year, the SNB decided for the first time to charge negative interest (–0.25%) on banks’ and other financial market participants’ sight deposits at the SNB. On 15 January – concurrently with the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate – we lowered the interest rate again, this time to –0.75%. This marked interest rate reduction was intended to cushion the blow of Swiss franc appreciation and to counter a tightening of monetary conditions, by making it significantly more expensive to hold Swiss francs compared to other currencies. Negative interest rates have stimulated a lively public debate. This is hardly surprising given that, in this form, such an instrument is something of a novelty that only a few central banks have deployed.2 Apart from the SNB, the National Bank of Denmark, Sweden’s Riksbank                                                 2  Switzerland has seen negative interest rates before: in the 1970s, negative interest was briefly charged in the form of commission on foreign funds held at commercial banks. In contrast to that period, today’s negative interest rate affects all sight deposits held at the SNB by banks and other financial market participants. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  and the European Central Bank have made use of negative interest rates to date. Experience with this instrument is thus relatively limited. Today, two months after negative interest rates were introduced, we can see that the measure is working and having the desired effect on the money and capital markets. The three-month Libor has been in negative territory since the announcement, dropping to a low of –0.96%; it is currently roughly in the middle of the target range (cf. chart 4). Long-term interest rates have also fallen, and the exchange rate too has now pulled back from the extreme values observed immediately following the discontinuation announcement. In trade-weighted terms, the Swiss franc is still at least 10% higher than it was at the beginning of the year. Overall, the Swiss franc is significantly overvalued and should weaken with time. When discussing the structure of the instrument, our deliberations focused on the interest rate level, but also in particular on the exemption thresholds above which negative interest was to be charged. We ultimately concluded that these thresholds should be calculated according to the minimum reserves banks are legally obliged to hold. This is a method that is both firmly anchored in law and for which clear rules exist. As a result, banks with large Swiss franc holdings at the SNB relative to the size of their balance sheets bear a heavier burden than banks with lower sight deposit balances. The fact that the banks face differing burdens has been criticised in certain quarters. Some have argued, for instance, that negative interest rates are distorting competition. This is certainly not our intention. Negative interest is a monetary policy measure that – like any other form of interest rate change – affects different industries and companies in different ways. Negative interest is intended to make it less attractive to hold large amounts of liquidity in Swiss francs. It is thus logical from a monetary policy perspective that banks which hold large quantities of Swiss franc liquidity relative to the size of their balance sheets should shoulder a heavier burden. As already mentioned, the introduction of negative interest rates on sight deposits at the SNB has also caused longer-term interest rates to fall. And yet, we have been living through a period of exceptionally low interest rates for around six years already, with even long-term investments bearing virtually no interest. The Swiss are a nation of savers and many people are concerned about low interest rates. I understand this, however we should not forget that what really counts for savers is not the nominal but the real (i.e. inflation-adjusted) interest rate. For some time now, inflation has been very low and now it is even negative. If inflation is negative, the real interest rate is higher than the nominal interest rate. As chart 5 shows, there have often been periods in the past when real interest rates were even lower than they are today. During this challenging phase for the Swiss economy, it is important that the negative interest rate be allowed to take effect and help to bring about a weakening of the Swiss franc. Efforts to circumvent negative interest rates by obtaining exemptions or shifting to cash are not in the interests of Switzerland as a whole in the current climate. Interest rate and exchange rate developments in recent weeks suggest that our monetary policy measures are gradually gaining traction. Economic outlook By introducing the minimum exchange rate, the SNB moderated the risks and adjustment costs to which the Swiss economy was exposed and bought it some time to adjust to a stronger franc. We are aware that the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate will mean that Switzerland has some difficult times ahead. The higher Swiss franc exchange rate – and especially the speed of Swiss franc appreciation since the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate – is particularly challenging for exporters and industries facing competition from imports. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In 2014, the Swiss economy recorded year-on-year growth of 2%. This increase was slightly above long-term potential growth and reflects the robust state of our economy. The exit from the minimum exchange rate has led to a deterioration of economic conditions. We thus expect a much more modest expansion of real economic output this year of just under 1%. A noticeable weakening in the economy may be expected, particularly in the first half of the year. In the short term, significant underutilisation of production capacity may be expected and unemployment is likely to increase moderately. There is of course a particularly high degree of uncertainty attached to such forecasts. For one thing, they will depend on how the Swiss franc exchange rate evolves in the coming months. For another, it is not certain how international conditions will develop. The US economy is more robust today than it was in 2011. The latest GDP figures for the euro area are once again more reassuring, although the situation remains difficult. In addition, the substantial fall in oil prices has had an easing effect. Despite all this, the risks – notably the debt dispute between Greece and the rest of the euro area, as well as the crisis in Ukraine – are not inconsiderable. In the long term, I am confident that our economy will be able to cope with Swiss franc appreciation. The currency has been strong in the past, and has a tendency to appreciate. While a strong currency is an expression of a sound economy, it also presents companies with major challenges, as an appreciating franc means higher prices for foreign customers buying from Swiss firms. In order to remain competitive, this disadvantage has to be continuously offset by adaptability, quality and innovation. Various competitiveness and innovation indicators suggest that Swiss companies have been very successful on this score in the past; the country regularly ranks among the leaders in these categories (cf. chart 6). These findings inspire optimism, however it is important to remember two things. First, we are dealing with averages here. When it comes to managing the new currency landscape, the options available to individual industries and companies will vary greatly; and so, in turn, will the impact of Swiss franc strength.3 Second, the extent of recent Swiss franc appreciation presents Switzerland’s economy with exceptional challenges which should certainly not be underestimated. But one thing is clear: entrepreneurial thinking is remains important. We have the utmost respect for this entrepreneurialism and for the employees who are being called upon to support these adjustments. Inflation outlook Let me now turn to the inflation outlook. The SNB’s mandate is to ensure price stability in the medium term, while taking due account of economic developments. We remain committed to maintaining price stability and the decision to exit the minimum exchange rate has not altered our mandate in any way. Last year, the inflation rate – as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) – hovered around zero. This year, inflation will decline well into negative territory. This is first and foremost due to two factors: Swiss franc appreciation since the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate and the sharp fall in oil prices. Last year, oil prices fell by some 40% in Swiss francs. According to an economist’s rule of thumb, this should translate to a decline in CPI inflation of almost 1 percentage point. The low inflation we are witnessing is thus in large part attributable to the collapse in oil prices. The important thing to remember here is that the effects of both the Swiss franc appreciation and the oil price drop are temporary. They will not jeopardise price stability.                                                 3  Cf. Bäuerle, G. and E. Steiner (2013): “How do individual sectors respond to macroeconomic shocks? A structural dynamic factor approach applied to Swiss data”, SNB Working Papers No. 9, 2013, or Drechsel, D. et al. (2015): “How are firms affected by exchange rate shocks? Evidence from survey based impulse responses”, KOF Working Papers No. 371, January 2015. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  We have revised our forecast downwards for the current year, from –0.1% to –1.1%. Inflation is expected to reach its low point in the third quarter of 2015, at –1.2%. We anticipate inflation of –0.5% for 2016. As you can see from chart 7, inflation will move back into positive territory only at the start of 2017. These forecasts assume that the three-month Libor remains at –0.75% over the entire forecast horizon, and that the Swiss franc weakens. Our forecasts show that the period of negative inflation is temporary. The SNB’s monetary policy strategy provides for positive inflation rates of below 2% in the medium term. So as long as the inflation rate returns to this range in the medium term, price stability will not be threatened. The important thing is that medium-term inflation expectations remain within a range that is compatible with price stability. While these inflation expectations have declined substantially, they are still in positive territory. This is confirmed in regular surveys by third-party providers, as well as in conversations between the SNB’s delegates for regional economic relations and company representatives from all sectors of the economy. Sustained negative inflation, or even a deflationary spiral – a negative feedback loop involving an economic downtrend and falling price levels – is thus not expected. Closing remarks In conclusion, let me reiterate that the minimum exchange rate was introduced as an exceptional and temporary measure during a period of unprecedented turmoil for the financial markets and the global economy. It served Switzerland well for more than three years, partially correcting the massive overvaluation of the Swiss franc. Last year, monetary policy in the euro area and Switzerland increasingly began to diverge. This was reflected in a very sharp depreciation of the euro against the US dollar. A minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro was thus no longer sustainable. The high and rising volumes of currency intervention that would have been necessary to maintain the minimum exchange rate would have resulted in an uncontrollable expansion of the SNB’s balance sheet. In the long term, this would have severely restricted its room for manoeuvre in monetary policy matters, and in turn its ability to fulfil its mandate. Given prevailing international conditions, the negative interest rate – and our willingness to intervene on the foreign exchange market as necessary – give us the tools to ensure price stability in the medium term. Seen from the current perspective, too, there is no threat to price stability in the medium and long term. The impact of the appreciation on consumer prices is temporary, although it may linger for some time. As regards economic developments, we are aware that the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate means that there are difficult times ahead for Switzerland. We have every confidence that Switzerland’s economy and its economic agents will rise to the challenge and adjust to the strong Swiss franc. The last few years have provided an impressive illustration of just how exceptionally adaptable this country’s entrepreneurs are. The Swiss franc is significantly overvalued and while it is expected to weaken over time, until it does, this substantial – and above all abrupt – appreciation of the currency will present considerable challenges. I repeat: My colleagues on the Governing Board and I have great respect for the business community whose task it will be to make these difficult adjustments.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jens Weidmann: Welcome remarks – Bundesbank conference on debt and financial stability Welcome remarks by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Bundesbank conference on debt and financial stability, Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2015. *      *      * 1. Introduction Ladies and gentlemen I welcome you all to the Bundesbank conference on debt and financial stability. It is a pleasure to have you here. The financial crisis and the euro-area sovereign debt crisis have certainly tainted the notion of debt. Listening to some of the discussions on the economic effects of debt, one could get the impression that debt is shorthand for “destroying economies big time”. And certainly, the notion that debt can be dangerous cannot be dismissed. Leverage does seem to be a crucial ingredient for financial crises – what matters most for financial stability may not be the size of a bubble, but how it was funded. Seminal work by Kiyotaki and Moore1 as well as by Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist2 in the 1990s has shed light on how credit can amplify shocks to the economy. In a downturn, the deteriorating balance sheets of borrowers and lenders constrict new lending, which in turn curtails investment and hence worsens the downturn. So, too much debt can be dangerous. But it remains equally true that debt is indispensable. It allows someone with an idea but without capital to follow through on that idea, thereby enabling wealth creation that otherwise would not have happened. Many studies show that financial development and growth go hand in hand.3 Doing away with debt is not an option. Rather, debt, like so many other economic issues, is not a question of “yes” or “no”, but a question of “how” and “how much” – a Goldilocks issue. Or, as former BIS chief economist Stephen Cecchetti and his colleagues Madhusudan Mohanty and Fabrizio Zampolli put it: “Debt is a two-edged sword. Used wisely and in moderation, it clearly improves welfare. But, when it is used imprudently and in excess, the result can be disaster.” The question then naturally arises: How much is “just right”, to say it in the words of Goldilocks? Cecchetti, Mohanty and Zampolli4 come up with concrete numbers. They find that when household debt goes beyond 85% of GDP, it becomes a drag on growth. The same threshold applies to government debt, while the figure for corporate debt is slightly higher at 90%. According to these estimates, in the euro area we are already in the danger zone – at least with regard to public debt standing at 91% and corporate debt at 105%. Household debt currently stands at 62%. Some caveats are in order here, though. Correlation does not necessarily equal causation. Does debt slow growth, or does a slowdown in growth cause                                                 1  N Kiyotaki and J Moore (1997). “Credit Cycles.” Journal of Political Economy 105 (2), 211–248. 2  B Bernanke, M Gertler and S Gilchrist (1996). “The Financial Accelerator and the Flight to Quality”, Review of Economics and Statistics 78 (1): 1–15. 3  R Levine (2005): “Finance and Growth: Theory and Evidence”, in P Aghion and S N Durlauf (eds), Handbook of Economic Growth Vol. 1 Part A, Chapter 12, pp 865–934. 4  S G Cecchetti, M Mohanty and F Zampolli (2011). “The real Effects of Debt.” BIS Working Papers No 352. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the debt-GDP ratio to rise? The policy implications would be different, depending on what really drives what. And identifying turning points in econometric models is a notoriously tricky business. The thresholds presented by the BIS researchers should probably not be taken as precise estimates of when growth falls of a cliff, but rather as one more piece of a growing body of evidence that too much debt can be as harmful to growth as too little. This growth slowdown can either take the form of a gradual tectonic shift, as high levels of debt weigh on new investment. Or it can take the form of an explosive eruption, as we have witnessed during the global financial crisis. And while both forms raise serious questions for policymakers, it is mainly the latter that today’s conference will address, since financial stability is part of the central banks’ remit. For the reasons I have just outlined, it would probably be a futile undertaking to try to pinpoint exactly when debt starts subtracting from rather than adding to economic welfare. In the end, the amount and the form of financial intermediation has to be determined by market forces. It is therefore all the more important that this market process functions as efficiently as possible. And this is where the regulators come in. It is our job to make sure that the regulatory treatment of debt does not give rise to incentives that endanger financial stability. And it is our job to make sure that, if things still go wrong, the financial sector can still deliver its important services to the real economy. As the financial crisis and the euro-area sovereign debt crisis have shown, there is ample room for improvement here. In particular, we need to ensure that all actors bear the responsibility for their respective decisions. To me, three issues are of special relevance in this regard: the question of bail-in vs. bail-out, the regulatory treatment of sovereign debt, and the tax preference of debt over equity. 2. Bail-in vs. bail-out Let me start with a question that has been debated heatedly since the crisis broke out: the issue of bail-in vs. bail-out. The financial sector is unique in that a malfunctioning of this sector impairs the functioning of all other sectors of the economy. And the crisis has served as a stark reminder that a malfunctioning cannot be ruled out. Some form of protection is therefore called for – otherwise, innocent bystanders in the real economy will inevitably get hurt. Depending on the kind of malfunctioning, the central bank might be able to provide the protection. If the issue is a temporary dry-up of liquidity, it can act as a lender of last resort and supply the necessary funding – on an interim basis. But if the issue is one of solvency, then the central bank has no role to play, as taxpayers’ money might be ultimately at stake. Rather, it is then for politicians to decide whether to let a bank fail or not. Providing insurance in the form of a bail-out comes with obvious moral hazard problems. If banks know that they are too big to fail, they are tempted to make the most of this insurance and take on excessive risks, at the expense of society at large. As the Bank of England’s Chief Economist Andy Haldane put it: “Only in banking do control rights and incentive wrongs combine so uncomfortably.” Instead of the public providing cost-free insurance for banks, the onus is on banks to insure themselves against failure. Only then are risk and reward aligned in a way that serves the public good. Or, as my predecessor Axel Weber likes to say: “We need to put the market back into the financial markets.” 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Two aspects are crucial here: the loss-absorbing capacity of banks – that is, their capital – and their resolvability. With regard to capital, a lot has already been done. Basel III has increased considerably the demands for both: the quantity and the quality of bank capital. But will that be enough? Second, the capital rules that are binding as of today are risk-weighted. As a general rule, this makes sense: otherwise, banks have an incentive to invest in the riskiest assets. But risk-weighting also means that there are potentially two ways in which sufficiently high capital ratios may come about: high equity or low risk weights. If meeting the requirements is based on the latter, the capital buffer might prove to be a mirage when push comes to shove. This is why we have to supplement the risk-weighted approach with an unweighted capital ratio: the leverage ratio. From this year on, banks are required to disclose the leverage ratio. But transparency alone is not enough. Now, we need to make sure that after a final calibration, the leverage ratio becomes a binding Pillar 1 requirement by 2018. But capital shields against losses only up to a point. And in any case, if the business model is no longer viable, the bank must be allowed to fail – otherwise, incentives are stunted for bank managers to exercise prudence and to improve efficiency. Regarding the development of resolution regimes, progress has been made, although in some countries more so than in others. One crucial issue still needs to be resolved: the establishment of a common standard for bail-inable capital, the so-called Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, or TLAC. Here, it is imperative that this insurance can really be called upon when needed. And this means that a bank should be discouraged from holding the bail-in debt of another bank, as in the event of a system-wide financial crisis, the insurance has to be provided by less-leveraged market participants. Otherwise, the crisis might be spread instead of contained. 3. The treatment of sovereign debt The importance of realigning risk and return has come to the fore with regard to yet another issue: the regulatory treatment of sovereign debt, which is the second financial stability facet of debt I would like to touch upon. Currently, the proposal to end the preferential treatment of sovereign debt is being dealt with in the same way as physical exercise is. Everybody agrees it’s a good thing in theory. But in practice, it’s very hard to get off the couch. Hence, as of now, sovereign debt denominated in an advanced country’s own currency is still considered risk-free. Danièle Nouy recently grasped the nettle and pointed out: “Sovereigns are not risk-free assets. That has been demonstrated, so now we have to react.” I wholeheartedly concur and have repeatedly asked to put this issue on the regulatory agenda. Sovereign debt needs to be backed by capital, and exposure to a single sovereign must be capped, just as is the case for any private debtor. I welcome that the regulatory treatment of sovereign debt is now being discussed by the Basel Committee. But if these discussions fail to produce an agreement, we need to move forward with a European solution. In contrast to other jurisdictions, the Eurosystem is for good reasons forbidden to act as lender of last resort for governments. The risk profile of euro-area sovereign debt is therefore different. 4. The tax deductibility of interest As Benjamin Franklin famously said, nothing is certain except death and taxes. But actually, this timeless quip does not apply to debt. Interest expenses are tax-deductible, while equity disbursements are not. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  How sensitive are banks to this difference in tax treatment? A study5 by IMF economists suggests that they are as sensitive as any other firm. What does this imply for the leverage of banks? The IMF economists estimate that abolishing the preferential tax treatment of debt would raise average unweighted bank equity by 2.2 to 4.2 percentage points. Even though the authors caution that the effect is likely to be lower for the biggest banks, these numbers are sizable by any measure, especially considering that the proposed Basel III leverage ratio is 3%. Doing away with the preferential tax treatment of debt could therefore provide a major boon for financial stability. 5. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, debt is like oxygen: indispensable for economic life, but when you overdose on it, you first get high, and then you faint. Air quality regulation has made great strides over the last decades, at least in the advanced countries. I hope we can replicate this regulatory progress with regard to debt as well. And I am confident that today’s conference will contribute to this process.                                                 5  R A de Mooij, M Keen and M Oriharai (2013). “Taxation, Bank Leverage, and Financial Crises”.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ben Broadbent: The economics of deflation Speech by Mr Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy of the Bank of England, at Imperial College Business School, London, 27 March 2015. *      *      * The CPI in February this year was no higher than in February 2014. This is the first time the UK has failed to record positive annual inflation for over 50 years. Inflation was briefly negative in late 1959 and early 1960. Before then, you have to go back to the early 1930s, and the agonies of the Great Depression, to find a period when UK consumer prices fell over a sustained period (Chart 1 plots three-year rolling averages of inflation). Because of the depth of the economic downturn at that time, and the more recent stagnation of Japan, the weakness of price inflation today has raised fears in some quarters about the risks of sustained deflation in this country.  The MPC’s objective is not simply to prevent prices from falling: it is to ensure they rise at the target rate of 2% a year. Because of the attention it’s been getting, however, I’m going to focus today on negative inflation specifically. I’ll divide the substance of my remarks in two. One part will discuss the basic economics – how and why it matters if prices decline over a protracted period – the other, the frequency and implications of deflation in the historical data.  Chart 1 Deflation last seen in 1930s Within that first section there are two points I’ll try and get across. One is the distinction between the price of what we buy (consumer prices) and the price of what we sell (mainly wages). For the moment it’s the first that’s fallen not the second: the drop in inflation has been driven largely by something that has significantly boosted real incomes (the sharp decline in commodity prices). It is what some have termed “good” deflation and, while it is unlikely to go on for that long, it is positive, not negative, for demand and output. There is a risk that the fall in prices becomes more generalised and more sustained. If so – and this is the second point about the economics – what matters is not deflation per se but the capacity of monetary policy to respond to it.  Source: ONS and Hills,Thomas, Dimsdale (2010).  There are circumstances, in particular when the appropriate or “neutral” real interest rate is clearly positive, and when it’s not entirely unexpected, in which mild deflation wouldn’t pose a problem. I think Britain was in precisely that position for much of the classical gold standard period, during the second half of the 19th century (you can see from Chart 1 that periods of deflation were common at that time; as we shall see, they didn’t appear especially damaging for output growth). Deflation becomes a problem if, in conjunction with the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, it prevents the monetary authority from setting a real short rate that’s sufficiently low to ensure stable growth.  
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Following the financial crisis, of course, the developed world has been in exactly that position: the neutral real rate of interest has been extremely depressed, official interest rates have been pushed to the zero lower bound and central banks have employed unconventional means of easing monetary policy. Were it to occur right now, sustained deflation would therefore pose more of a risk than at times when the neutral real rate was higher.  But, in my view, those risks are nonetheless relatively contained. For one thing I think the evidence suggests that unconventional policy is effective: even if they don’t circumvent it entirely, asset purchases help soften the constraint of the zero lower bound. Second, with the financial system gradually improving my guess is that the neutral real rate of interest is more likely to rise than fall over the next couple of years. Third, and most importantly, I think the chances of a sustained and widespread deflation are in any case low.  That’s certainly what the international experience suggests. That experience is substantial: we have annual CPI data since 1960 for over 70 countries, a total of over 3,000 data points. In only 70 cases (barely 2% of the sample) have consumer prices actually fallen and in the majority of those inflation was positive the following year. Of the 24 instances in which prices have fallen for more than one year, all but four – two in Japan, two in Bahrain – have occurred in developing countries with pegged exchange rates. In fact, there’s a general tendency for changes in inflation to be more persistent when the exchange rate is fixed. At least when policy has a degree of credibility, deviations of inflation tend to peter out relatively rapidly in countries with independent monetary policies.   In part this may reflect precisely the freedom to ease policy that, if it’s not ruled out by an exchange rate peg, may nonetheless be compromised by the zero lower bound. At least until it began to conduct QE, almost a decade after the economy began to turn down, Japan was clearly in this position. But I suspect it’s also because, when there’s an independent and credible policy, the risk that inflation expectations become “de-anchored” from any target is lower to begin with.  As I say, for us that target is 2%, not zero. Even if the current undershoot is due mostly to the effect on the level of the CPI of the sharp drop in commodity prices, and should therefore have only passing effects on its rate of growth, our central expectation is that inflation will still be below target in a year’s time. All else equal, we probably need to see not just stable prices of commodities and other tradable goods if we’re to meet the target over a reasonable horizon, but some further acceleration in domestic costs as well. While that’s what the central forecast in the February Inflation Report entails, the MPC will obviously have to be watchful, in the meantime, for signs that “good” deflation is turning into something worse.  But we should not over-state the risks. The costs of deflation: income and interest rates matter too Something one hears quite often is that deflation is a problem “because it encourages people to postpone consumption”. Deflation – or more precisely the expectation that prices will fall – therefore weakens demand, it is said, and this can lead to a vicious circle in which prices are then depressed further.  As far as it goes this has some truth to it. But it’s at best a partial description of the problem, at worst a bit misleading. It leaves out two important considerations.  One is nominal income. Suppose you’re told that prices will fall over the next year but that the value of your income will remain unchanged. All else equal, the prospect of falling prices will give you an incentive to save more of your income (i.e. to postpone a bit of consumption). At the same time, the real value of that income will prospectively have risen. On most 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  estimates of the various sensitivities the second effect will dominate the first and consumption should actually rise1, even before those price cuts actually arrive.  Conversely, if all prices fall simultaneously, including the price of labour (the nominal wage), then there’s no boost to real income to offset any increased tendency to save. Not only that, falls in nominal income would also expose the economy to a potentially much more serious risk, namely a rising burden of debt. Because the principal is fixed in nominal terms, shortfalls in cash income make debts harder to service, increasing the risk of financial instability and the pressure on debtors to cut back spending. It’s this “debt deflation” channel, emphasised originally by Irving Fisher and studied in depth by Ben Bernanke, amongst others, that is thought to have been the main cost of falling prices and wages during the Great Depression. It’s therefore important to understand whether “deflation” is happening simply because there’s been a sharp drop in the price of something we buy – oil, say – or whether it’s a more generalised phenomenon in which nominal incomes too are falling.  The other important factor is interest rates. The incentive to save depends not on inflation expectations per se but on the (ex ante) real rate of interest. As long as nominal interest rates are higher than inflation – and that’s been the case through history, more often than not – foregoing £1 of spending today buys you more than £1’s worth of spending tomorrow. So this “postponement” effect doesn’t suddenly appear when expected inflation dips below zero: it’s always there, to varying degrees, and depends on the extent to which expected inflation lies below the nominal rate of interest, i.e. the real interest rate.  Indeed, it’s partly by tweaking this incentive to save, via the short-term real rate, that monetary policy is in theory supposed to work. If confidence in the future suddenly declines, for example – something that would on its own tend to push up rates of saving – the central bank will tend to react by lowering interest rates and pushing back in the opposite direction, in order to sustain demand. The appropriate real interest rate will therefore change over time. And the relevant question, in this context, is not so much whether people expect any sort of deflation, but whether they expect it at a pace that exceeds whatever is the appropriate real interest rate at the time2. If that were to happen, policy would run into the zero lower bound for nominal rates and central banks will find themselves reaching for unconventional policy tools.  Similarly, debt dynamics are driven not by nominal income growth in isolation but how that growth compares with nominal interest rates3. If the two fall rise and fall together – to the extent nominal interest rates can accommodate movements in nominal income growth – there’s no impact on debt accumulation: whatever proportion of income was needed to service debts beforehand is sufficient after the fact. It’s when income growth falls a lot further                                                 1 Economists call the sensitivity of consumption to a change in its relative price over time the “inter-temporal elasticity”. That coefficient is poorly measured in the data but usually found to be relatively small and significantly less than one. At the same time, a permanent gain in real income should, even it’s expected to arrive only a year from now, prompt an immediate and almost one-for-one response of spending today. So, at least in principle, the positive “income effect” of a prospective drop in prices – holding fixed nominal pay – should be expected to outstrip the negative “inter-temporal substitution effect”.   2 If the appropriate real rate is r* then the central bank would ideally want to set a nominal rate of r*+ πe, where the second term is inflation expectations. But nominal rates can’t be lower than zero – or whatever number, close to zero, constitutes the effective lower bound – so if r*+ πe < 0 the actual real rate will be higher than it should be. Note that this can happen either if πe is well below zero or if, as has been the case since the crisis, the same happens to r*.  3 If b is the ratio of debt to income then its growth rate is given by r−g−s/b, where r is the ex post interest rate, g the growth rate of income and s the proportion of income used to pay off debt. So if g falls and r does not either debt starts rising faster than income or debtors must save more; if r and g change by the same magnitude b and s don’t have to.  
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  than the interest rate, and therefore when servicing debts requires much more of their incomes than people had expected, that problems can arise4.  When (mild) deflation doesn’t matter: a high neutral real rate I think you can see the importance of these considerations in the UK, both in recent history and, as it happens, over a much more distant period.  In the second half of the 19th century, and up until the First World War, Britain and much of the advanced world were on the Gold Standard: the price of gold was fixed at £3.83/oz. Deflation was commonplace. Discoveries of gold occurred only intermittently, and because the global economy – and therefore the demand for currency – was generally expanding, its real price often came under upward pressure. With the nominal price fixed, the only way that could happen is if the denominator of that real price – the price of goods and services – declined. Thus UK consumer prices fell significantly during the 1840s, for example, and again in the late 1850s; they also fell through the 1880s (Chart 2). And although real pay tended to grow over time, these deflations were sometimes severe enough to mean that nominal wages declined.   Chart 2 Deflations common during Gold Standard However, there’s no evidence this had an especially severe effect on the economy. To be sure, lower inflation was associated with weaker GDP growth, lower wage growth with higher unemployment (Charts 3 and 4). But there doesn’t look to be anything particularly bad about negative inflation: as far as one can tell, the economic cost of moving from of zero to  –1% (say), whether in price or wage space, wasn’t any worse than that involved in going from 5% to 4% (for example5).  One reason for this may be that people were adapted to the regime – they were used to the idea that prices, and even nominal wages, occasionally declined, and because these things were therefore more flexible, it didn’t take an especially severe recession to get that to happen.   Source: ONS and Hills,Thomas, Dimsdale (2010).                                                    4 The lower bound for nominal interest rates may be relevant in this context too: in the United States wage growth averaged -13% between 1929 and 1932 and, by the time that deflation got going, it would have been impossible to cut interest rates to those sorts of levels. This led to dramatic rises in the burden of debt and rates of default.   5 If deflations per se were costly you’d expect to see Charts 3 and 4 become shallower south of the origin.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Chart 3 Those deflations no more costly than other disinflations… Chart 4 …same was true for wage growth   Source: ONS and Hills,Thomas, Dimsdale (2010). Source: ONS and Hills,Thomas, Dimsdale (2010).   Chart 5 Interest rate unconstrained by zero bound But what must also have been important, it seems to me, is that the appropriate level of real interest rates was sufficiently high through the period that monetary policy never had to contend with the zero lower bound on the nominal rate6. Chart 5 adds to Chart 2 the series for Bank Rate, in green. The real short-term interest rate – which we know, after the event, can’t have deviated that much from the level necessary to sustain stable growth and prices (since that’s what generally occurred) – averaged 4% between 1850 and 1914. If the neutral real rate is anything like that high, only a very severe deflation would drag the appropriate nominal rate close to zero. As it was, Bank Rate was unconstrained from responding to lower nominal growth7, when that occurred, and never fell below 2%.  Source: ONS and Hills,Thomas, Dimsdale (2010).                                                  6 By “zero” I mean the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates; this may not be precisely zero.  7 I say “respond” but, as a broad generalisation, the Gold Standard allowed for no significant degree of monetary autonomy: there might be a number of explanations for the pro-cyclicality of real short-term interest rates but they were not, by and large, a matter of free choice of the central bank (Obstfeld et al (2005); for a recent and interesting discussion, see also Morys (2012)). My point is that, had there been a lower neutral real rate, the Gold Standard would have delivered a worse outcome in co-ordinated downturns because the lower bound may have been a constraint.  
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Perhaps the authorities of the time were just lucky not to have run into the zero lower bound. But I think this episode illustrates that even protracted declines in prices needn’t be especially costly if, for whatever reason, the appropriate real interest rate is relatively high.  Sustained deflation more costly when interest rates close to the lower bound  Clearly, we are not in the same position today. Cuts in interest rates after the financial crisis were crucial in preventing a much worse downturn. They depressed the real short rate, softening what might otherwise have been a steeper rise in the saving rate. Matching the decline in productivity and income growth (Chart 6), the resulting falls in household interest rates meant deleveraging could occur without a big jump in gross debt repayments8. Net of interest payments, growth of nominal incomes has been little different over the past six years than it was in the pre-crisis decade (Chart 7).  But balance sheets and gross debts are clearly far larger now than in the late 19th century. Productivity and real income growth have been significantly lower and, partly for that reason, the neutral real interest rate fell steeply after the crisis and almost certainly into appreciably negative territory. So even without deflation, central banks have found themselves up against the zero lower bound and compelled to employ unconventional policy tools. As a result, there is now less room to deal with any entrenched and protracted deflation, in prices and wages alike, should that occur.

A good disinflation so far… What are the chances of such a thing? Certainly what we’ve had in the past few months doesn’t qualify. In fact, it’s been a largely positive story, because the fall in inflation has been                                                 8 Recall that the evolution of debt:income ratios depends on the gap between interest rates and income growth (footnote 3), i.e. the two lines in Chart 6. The fact this gap failed to widen didn’t prevent a significant impact of the credit crunch on spending: that’s effectively because, during such episodes, the maximum allowable debt:income ratio declines. So spending is forced to contract even without any increase in (r-g).    
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  driven not by the declining value of what we sell, including wages – though weak by pre-crisis standards, nominal income growth has actually risen slightly of late – but by a steep fall in the real price of something we buy9. This therefore counts as what the economist Michael Bordo calls a “good” disinflation, driven by an improvement in productivity or (as in this case) the terms of trade. In the year to 2014Q4 real per capita disposable income grew at its fastest rate for seven years; real income growth is likely to have picked up further in 2015Q1 (Chart 8).  There is evidence this has already fed through to spending and to household confidence. Real household consumption too rose at its fastest pace for seven years during the course of 2014. And this occurred despite a marked decline in survey measures of households’ near-term inflation expectations (Chart 9) – little evidence here that weaker inflation expectations delay or depress consumer spending.   Chart 8  Drop in commodity prices has boosted real per capita income Chart 9  Financial market measures of inflation expectations close to average  Source: ONS; ex income from and consumption of imputed rents.   Source: Source: Bank of England, Barclays Capital  In truth, I don’t think we should be terribly surprised by this. Theory says households will raise consumption one-for-one with any increase in the level of real income deemed to be permanent. In practice people may take time to react to real income shocks; it’s also possible they expect some of the recent declines in energy prices to be reversed10. But, in the data, there’s no correlation between household saving rates and changes in real energy prices, either here or elsewhere in the OECD11. This suggests their effects on income are in general matched by equivalent shifts in real spending. Note that the UK is not the only place where consumer confidence has risen in recent months (Chart 10).                                                  9 This point was made in a recent speech by the Governor (Carney (2015)) and, in an article, by Kristin Forbes (2015). 10 Forward markets discount an oil price of $69/bl at the end of next year, quite a bit higher than the current spot price though still well below where it was in mid-2014 ($54 and $110 respectively). 11 In regressions of changes in saving rates on the contribution to real income growth of energy and food prices, the estimated coefficient is close to zero and statistically insignificant in all 17 OECD countries for which we have data.  
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Nor is it unusual to see stronger demand at a time when these survey measures of household inflation expectations are falling. Typically, these near-term expectations surveys track actual inflation12. And quite a bit of the high-frequency variation in the CPI arises from things that don’t directly affect nominal pay – taxes and import prices, for example – but do affect its real value. When taxes or import prices go down, real incomes rise (and vice-versa). This produces a negative near-term correlation between inflation and real income growth; controlling for nominal pay, there is also a clear negative correlation between surveyed inflation expectations and household optimism (Chart 11).   Chart 10  Consumer confidence has strengthened in US, Euro area  Chart 11  Surveyed household inflation expectations, optimism negatively correlated   Source: European Commission, Conference Board   Source: ONS, Gfk/EC, Barclays Capital. Note: * after controlling for current wage growth.   These results might give one pause about whether the “delayed consumption” channel really is that important, or whether the surveys of inflation expectations are really telling you about what matters. The link between consumption and real interest rates is not an empirically strong one13. Other measures of inflation expectations – for example from financial markets – are less depressed (Chart 9). A recent study using US data found that, even controlling for nominal income, there was no correlation across individuals between their reported expectations of inflation and spending14. At the very least, the results are a reminder not to consider current inflation or survey measures of household inflation expectations on their own, but in the context of what’s happening to incomes and interest rates.                                                 12 By contrast, they contain no significant information about future inflation beyond past inflation itself. In other words, in regressions of inflation on lags of itself and lagged expectations, the estimated coefficients on the latter are typically statistically insignificant.   13 David Miles made this point in a recent speech (Miles (2015)). To take a few of many studies, see also Hansen and Singleton (1982), Campbell and Mankiw (1989) and Canzoneri et al (2005).  14 Bachmann et al (2015). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  International experience: proper deflations are rare, especially in countries with floating currencies That doesn’t mean we can rest entirely easy. In particular, it would be wrong blithely to assume that positive nominal income growth will continue, come what may. Deflations have to start somewhere and there is a risk that falling prices will beget yet weaker or even negative wage growth – that today’s “good” deflation will metastasise into something a good deal worse. Bordo classifies “bad” disinflations as those that coincide with recessions, “ugly” episodes as steep and generalised falls in nominal quantities, all the uglier in the presence of large gross debts.  However, my own view is that the chances of such an outcome are relatively low. I say that partly because base effects will naturally give a big positive impetus to annual inflation in early 2016. “Core” inflation is still running at over 1% and, barring another steep decline in food and energy prices over the next year, headline inflation is likely to rise quite steeply in early 2016.  I’m also struck by the rarity of persistent deflation in the past15, particularly amongst countries with an independent monetary policy. As we’ve seen, long periods of falling prices were perfectly common during the Gold Standard. That’s inevitable under a commodity peg if, over any period of time, the commodity itself is in fixed supply. The same was true in other countries at the time and, infamously, during the Great Depression. It was only when Britain came off gold, in 1931, that its nominal income started to accelerate16.  And since the Second World War, and the abandonment of commodity standards, positive inflation has been the norm – so much so, in fact, that the commonly cited example of the Japanese deflation is almost unique.

(2015)); see also Broadbent et al (2010).  16 For more on the contractionary effect of the Gold Standard during the Great Depression, see Eichengreen (1996).  
   10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The international data on consumer prices are relatively rich: we have annual numbers for over 70 countries, most of them back to 196017. In all, across countries and years, there are 3,300 separate post-war observations. In only 70 of these – barely 2% of the sample – has inflation actually been negative (Chart 12a); the majority of these “deflations” (46 out of 70) have lasted no more than a year, many of these shorter episodes coinciding with falls in oil prices; of the 24 deflations lasting two or more years, 20 have been in economies with fixed exchange rates, most of those emerging economies; among countries with freely floating exchange rates, only Bahrain and – somewhat more famously – Japan have experienced protracted deflations, both of them twice (Chart 12b). This is not a common occurrence. A credible monetary policy reduces the persistence of movements in inflation Why might deflations be rarer in countries with floating exchange rates, and in emerging economies, and should this provide any reassurance today? Yes, I think – to a degree.  One plausible reason for this pattern is that countries with fixed exchange rates give up autonomy to control their own rate of inflation. Instead, domestic inflation is determined by (i) inflation in the country to which their exchange rate has been fixed (most often the US) and (ii) forces affecting their real exchange rate. Those forces are often important in emerging markets: their terms of trade move around more and they are also subject to more volatile financial flows than developed countries. Shocks that would tend to depress the nominal exchange rate, were it free to fall – a drop in the terms of trade, for example, or heightened risk aversion and capital flight – instead show up as negative inflation18.  It’s not just the volatility that’s higher, however: it turns out that shocks to inflation are also more persistent in countries with fixed exchange rates (Chart 13; see also Monacelli and Gali (2005)). And while this may simply reflect the particular disturbances affecting the equilibrium real exchange rate – perhaps they play out only over time – it’s also possible that the persistence of inflation owes something to the lack of a stable domestic objective for monetary policy.  In our theories, wage and price-setting are forward looking: high (low) expectations of inflation over the future drag up (depress) actual inflation today. That’s precisely why central banks concern themselves with the stability of inflation expectations. It’s also why a credible inflation target is to some degree self-regulating. If people expect inflation generally to be on target, over the medium term, the central bank has to do less actively to ensure it. Notably, the persistence of movements in UK inflation fell sharply after the introduction of inflation targeting in 1992 (Chart 14). To the extent this reflects improved credibility it implies less of a need for policy to respond to one-off hits to the price level.                                                    17 Data from Bordo and Eichengreen (1999), updated from OECD and IMF sources. 18 The capacity of fixed-exchange rate systems to experience genuinely inflationary shocks – those that move wage and price inflation jointly – is also evident in Chart 2. The correlation between wage and price inflation was +0.6 during the classical Gold Standard; under inflation targeting it’s been -0.2. That may also reflect a more volatile environment for real wages shocks (i.e. to the terms of trade and productivity). Nor are floating exchange rates a guarantee of stable inflation: during the 1970s and 1980s, when there was no stable nominal target at all, this correlation rose to 0.9. But inflationary shocks appear better contained with a domestic inflation target than an exchange rate or commodity peg.

Conclusion: policy should be flexible but don’t over-react to low inflation We’ve heard a lot about the risk that deflationary expectations persuade people to defer spending. We’ll no doubt hear it again if inflation were to dip below zero over the next couple of months. But it’s at best a partial point. All else equal, the incentive to save depends not on inflation expectations per se but on how far away they are from the nominal interest rate, i.e. the real interest rate. By any measure – even if you use the near-term household surveys as measure of inflation expectations – the real rate is extremely low, and still negative (Chart 15). The extensive empirical evidence for this “inter-temporal substitution” channel is in any case relatively weak – as the Governor pointed out recently, the more important threat, particularly in developed economies with large balance sheets, is debt deflation. And in that regard, it’s the gap between interest rates and nominal income growth that matters. Notably, nominal income growth has not declined of late. Real interest rates still need to be low. Our inflation target is 2% not zero: what makes the current position “good” is not low inflation per se but the fact that, in this particular instance, it’s been caused by something (a drop in oil prices) that improves real incomes. Even though the direct effect of that decline will drop out of the annual comparison later this year and in early 2016, there’s a risk that, by depressing wage growth, sub-target inflation could persist for longer than we expect.   0.00.40.81.21.6196219721982199220022012Consumption deflatorGDP deflatorEstimated coefficient in regression of UK inflation on lagged inflation, 20 year rolling window 
   12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Chart 15 Real interest rates are low More fundamentally, as I sought to explain in a recent speech, the “neutral” interest rate consistent with stable growth and inflation seems to have fallen significantly over the years, both before and since the financial crisis. That’s why, even without deflationary expectations, central banks came up against the zero lower bound for interest rates. And it’s that zero bound that ultimately makes deflations costly.    Source: BOE, Barclays Capital and own calculations.  My own view, however, is that the likelihood of a broad and protracted deflation, afflicting wages as well as prices, is pretty low. The evidence suggests that asset purchases positively affect nominal growth – they may not by-pass the lower bound on interest rates but they certainly soften it. My guess is that, with the financial system improving, and signs that the worst fears about the global economy may be subsiding, the neutral real interest rate is more likely to rise than fall over the next couple of years. Over that period, headline inflation will get a sizeable kick upwards, once the falls in food and energy prices drop out of the annual comparison. In the meantime, the UK labour market continues to tighten – low inflation won’t be the only influence on pay growth this year – and the boost imparted by lower commodity prices to real incomes is already apparent in higher consumer spending, here and in other countries too.   Finally, history tells us these episodes are rare – rare, in the case of developed countries with floating exchange rates, almost to the point of uniqueness.  Thank you.

In March 2009 the Bank of England cut official UK interest rates to 0.5%, their lowest-ever level. Financial markets did not expect this low level of interest rates to persist, with the first rise expected nine months later in December 2009. Yet six years on, official UK interest rates remain at 0.5%. The first rise in UK interest rates is still expected around a year hence (Chart 1). Like a bad flight, the take-off time for interest rates has been repeatedly put back. That pattern has been mirrored internationally. In March 2009 US policy rates were in a range of 0–0.25%, their lowest-ever level. Markets expected them to rise within a year. In the euro-area, policy rates were also at all-time lows, but were expected to rise within 18 months or so. Six years on, US policy rates remain between 0–0.25%, while euro-area rates are 150 basis points lower. The first rise in US policy rates is still expected within a year, while the first rise in euro-area rates is now not expected for over four years (Chart 2).

   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches average, by only 10 basis points per year in the US, 7 basis points per year in the UK, 6 basis points per year in Japan and 5 basis points per year in the euro-area. That is the most gradual of interest rate glide-paths. The eventual cruising altitude for interest rates expected by financial markets is also remarkably low by historical comparison. The level of forward interest rates 30 years hence is around 3% in the US, 2.5% in the UK, 2% in Japan and 1.2% in the euro-area. Up until the crisis, the average level of policy rates in these countries in the post-war period was 3%, 7%, 4% and 3% respectively – for most, roughly double the levels currently expected. Interest rate end-points are also remarkably low. In a growing number of countries, interest rates are not just low but have recently turned negative. At last count, eleven countries had negative shorter-term bond yields, including nine within the euro-area. In part, that reflects the effects of a recent further round of policy loosening by central banks. At present, two-thirds of countries globally have policy rates below 3% (Chart 4).   Of course, what goes down can also bounce back up. Recently, there has been some upwards movement in UK and US yield curves. But yields elsewhere, especially in Europe, have continued to fall. And the longer-term trend is clear: a persistent ratcheting-down in interest rates across all maturities and virtually all countries, to reach unprecedentedly low levels. As a recent example of that, Chart 5 plots the UK forward curve at monthly intervals over the past 9 months.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 What explains this remarkable pattern of global interest rates? And what implications does it carry for monetary policy, in the UK and internationally? I want to offer some reflections on those two questions. To be clear, these views are personal ones, in my capacity as a member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), rather than necessarily representing the collective view of the MPC. The drop A significant part of the explanation for low interest rates, at least in the years immediately after the crisis, was the weakness of demand. Chart 6 looks at the path for UK output growth expected in the MPC’s Inflation Report each February since 2009. Up until around 2012, growth significantly and repeatedly disappointed to the downside. The same was true internationally, with IMF forecasts significantly and repeatedly revised down. With recovery weaker and taking longer than expected, the expected date of interest rate rises was repeatedly put back, and the expected level of future rates was lowered, in the UK (Chart 1) and globally (Chart 2). Over the past two years, this story has subtly changed. UK growth has, if anything, surprised to the upside over this period. UK growth in 2013 and 2014 averaged over 2%. And the MPC’s February Inflation Report forecasts the UK growing above its historic trend over the next two years. Yet despite this, the expected path of UK interest rates has continued to drift down. That is because macro-economic surprises have continued, but have switched from the real to the nominal side, from stalling growth to falling inflation. Inflation has consistently and significantly undershot the Bank’s forecasts since 2012, in particular over the past 12 months (Chart 7).

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 UK CPI inflation has closely followed global CPI trends since the crisis, with their correlation strikingly high at 0.8 – double its level pre-crisis. UK inflation currently stands at 0.3%, its lowest-ever recorded level. According to the MPC’s latest Inflation Report, it is more likely than not the UK will join those countries facing temporary deflation this year. These global disinflationary forces are, in large part, the result of shocks to world prices. Oil prices have fallen by over 50% since the middle of last year. By itself, this would be expected to lower temporarily UK CPI inflation by around ¾ percentage points. Beyond oil, agricultural commodity prices have fallen by 25% in the past two years due to good harvests. Global non-fuel export prices, on a UK trade-weighted basis, have fallen 2%. These weak external price pressures go a long way towards explaining the fall in global CPI inflation over the past two years. They also account for around two-thirds of the fall in UK CPI inflation over the same period. If these are one-off shocks to the price level, their impact on annual inflation measures should drop out after a year. Such temporary deviations of inflation from target should be “looked through” in setting monetary policy.2 This is not, however, the whole inflation story. The weakness of global prices is not wholly the result of one-off shifts in global supply. For example, although supply news is likely to have been the biggest driver of the recent fall in oil prices, a weakening outlook for world demand is also likely to have played a material role. Moreover, perhaps between a quarter and a third of the fall in inflation, globally and in the UK, is not explained by weak external prices. Another source of “drag” has been at work.3 Identifying those drag factors is important when accounting for disinflationary trends in the past, but also when assessing whether these trends will persistent in the future. The drag If you consider the traditional determinants of inflation, there are at least three plausible sources of disinflationary “drag”: slack in the economy, a weaker relationship between slack and wages and lower levels of inflation expectations. These explanations are not mutually exclusive. Higher levels of slack, or a weaker relationship between slack and wages, could lower inflation expectations – for example, if demand is weak today, people may expect lower inflation tomorrow. And lower wage and inflation expectations could themselves depress demand – for example, by raising levels of real interest rates. Nonetheless, it is worth considering these explanations in turn. (a) Slack and the Phillips Curve The short-term relationship between unemployment or the output gap and wage growth or inflation – the Phillips curve – is one of the most intensively studied in macro-economics.4 Despite that, empirical estimates of the Phillips curve have tended to be poorly-identified. That may reflect the effects of structural and behavioural shifts, which have the potential to alter historically-estimated Phillips curve relationships. For example, changes in the credibility of the monetary policy regime can cause inflation and wage expectations to alter, causing the Phillips curve to shift around over time for a given level of slack. And changes in the competitive structure of labour and product markets can influence the impact of slack on wage and price pressures, causing the Phillips curve to change slope over time.                                                  2 See the Governor’s Open Letter to the Chancellor (Bank of England, 2015b). 3 Bank of England (2015b). 4 Google Scholar lists more than 3000 citations for Phillips’ original article (Phillips (1958)). 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Chart 10 plots the historical relationship between wage growth and unemployment in the UK over the period since 1856. Although noisy, it suggests a negative relationship between the two, with an average slope of just under ½. In others words, a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate has, on average in the past, lowered wage growth by around half a percentage point. A somewhat clearer window on this long-run Phillips curve relationship is provided by looking at distinct monetary regimes: exchange rate targeting regimes under the Gold and dollar standards (1856–1970); discretionary monetary policy regimes without central bank independence (1970–1997); and inflation-targeting regimes with independently-set monetary policies (1997 onwards). Chart 11 plots the Phillips curve relationship over these windows. The introduction of discretionary monetary policy regimes, without independence, caused an outward shift in the Phillips curve and a shift up in wage and inflation expectations. That is consistent with a loss of monetary credibility. Since 1997, however, inflation expectations having shifted back inwards, restoring the Phillips curve to something closer to its position prior to 1970.5  Chart 10: A long run estimate of the wage Phillips curve in the UK      Sources:  Crafts and Mills (1994), Feinstein (1972) and ONS. Notes: Unemployment is measured here by the claimant count, and is lagged by one year. For more information on the long-run data used to construct this index, see Hills et al (2010, 2015). Chart 11: The wage Phillips curve under different policy regimes in the UK    Sources:  See footnote to Chart 10.  If we look more closely at the most recent period, a second feature stands out (Chart 12). UK wage growth has been puzzlingly weak over the past few years, lying below the Phillips curve estimated since 1997. While UK unemployment has fallen more than 2 percentage points since 2013, wage growth has remained in the range 1–2% per year. This is, to a degree, a global phenomenon. For example, the US Phillips curve also shifted inward after the Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s (Chart 13). And US wage growth has                                                  5 This result is also found when wages are adjusted for inflation expectations as discussed in Broadbent (2014).  -20-10010203005101520Wage inflationUnemployment rate (lagged 1yr)1856-2014-20-10010203005101520Wage inflationUnemployment rate (lagged 1yr)1856-19701970-19971997-2014
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 also been puzzlingly weak over the past few years.6 Despite unemployment falling around 2 percentage points, wage growth has remained around 2%.  Chart 12: The UK wage Phillips curve    Sources:  ONS and Bank calculations Chart 13: The US wage Phillips curve    Sources:  Thomson Reuters Datastream   These Phillips curve surprises can be clearly seen in the Bank’s own forecast errors for wage growth and unemployment over the past few years (Chart 14). Since 2011, unemployment has come in consistently below the Bank’s expectations. Yet despite this unexpected strength in the labour market, wage growth has come in consistently and significantly lower than the Bank’s forecasts. In part, that reflects weak productivity, which has also been significantly lower than the Bank’s forecasts. But wage growth has been surprisingly weak even allowing for that. In response to this wage weakness, the MPC has dynamically adjusted its estimates of slack. For example, last year the MPC revised upwards its estimate of the so-called “participation gap” – the wedge between actual and equilibrium levels of participation in the labour force. By increasing the assumed drag from slack, that revision explained away part of the wage puzzle.                                                  6 See Yellen (2014). -505101520253035400510151971-19971998-20122013-2014Fitted 1971-1997Fitted 1998-2014Unemployment rateWage inflation0123456789100246810121971-19821983-20112012-2014Fitted 1971-1982Fitted 1983-2011Unemployment rateWage inflationChart 14: Inflation Report forecast errors on wage growth and unemployment   Source: ONS and Bank calculations.

   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches Even after making these adjustments, however, the wage puzzle has persisted. This can be seen by comparing the actual and estimated paths of wages from the Bank’s suite of wage equations, using as inputs the Bank’s estimates of “slack” in the labour market, as well as productivity and other wage determinants.  Wage growth has consistently and significantly undershot its expected path, even after controlling for slack and other shocks. Cumulatively, this undershoot is large, with the level of wages more than 2% below predicted estimates over the past two years. There are a number of possible explanations for this wage puzzle. These have potentially quite different implications for future wage growth and hence policy.  The first is simply that the lags from lower unemployment to wage growth are a little longer than in the past. That might be the case because job-to-job flows in the labour market have been low by historical standards, only recently picking up towards pre-recession levels. If so, we might expect the recent undershoot in wages to course-correct in the period ahead, as labour market activity picks up. In essence, this is the judgement underpinning the MPC’s central view of wages in the February Inflation Report. Wage growth is projected to rise, reaching 3.4% by end-2015. In effect, wages error-correct. There is some tentative evidence of wage growth picking up over the past few months, although yesterday’s wage data were notably weaker. If this pick-up were to continue, the wage puzzle would have been benign. Indeed, with slack eroding, we might then be concerned that wage pressures could overshoot, posing upside risks to the inflation target.7 But there are other explanations of the wage puzzle which pose downside inflation risks. One is that the Phillips curve has become less steep than in the past. This would mean that a fall in unemployment might have a lower impact on wage pressures than in the past. This might arise because the pool of workers willing to enter the labour force at the existing wage rate has increased – for example, older workers prepared to work longer than they had planned or workers from overseas moving into the UK labour force.  There is evidence of many of these trends intensifying over the past few years. For example, the unemployment rate among 18-to-24 year olds has fallen by almost 4 percentage points over the past year. The trend in labour force participation rate has picked up significantly among women and older cohorts over the same period. And net migration to the UK was estimated to be almost 300,000 in the year to September 2014, almost double the level two years earlier.                                                  7 For example, Weale (2015).

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 There is evidence, in the UK and internationally, to support the Phillips curve having flattened over time. For example, cross-country evidence from the IMF suggests that the slope of the price Phillips curve has fallen, from around one in the 1970s to 0.1–0.2 today (Chart 16). That could reflect the effects of globalisation, enhancing competition in domestic labour and product markets.8 The implications of a flatter Phillips curve for future wage growth and inflation can be assessed by re-running the projections from the MPC’s February Inflation Report. Specifically, assume a halving of the Phillips curve slope used in the model of Chart 15, from 1 to 0.5.9 That slope is still well above the levels in Chart 16. Chart 17 shows the results from this exercise. Wages and prices are both weaker throughout: at the two-year horizon, wage growth is 0.6 percentage points lower than in the February Inflation Report, while inflation is 0.2 percentage points lower. In other words, a flatter Phillips curve would generate a downside risk to the inflation outlook at the policy horizon. A final explanation for the wage puzzle is that weak wages are signalling that the output or unemployment gap is larger than currently estimated. There are a number of potential sources of such additional slack, including greater spare capacity in firms, a greater willingness among workers to increase their average hours, or a lower long-term rate of unemployment than is currently estimated by the Bank.10  How much additional slack? Imagine you asked yourself how much slack would be needed to resolve the wage puzzle of the past few years. Even with a very conservative estimate of the Phillips curve slope, the implied degree of slack could be somewhere close to 4%, materially above the MPC’s current central view of slack of around ½%.                                                  8 For instance, see Rogoff (2003, 2006), Ball (2006), Bernanke (2006), IMF (2006), Borio and Filardo (2007) and BIS (2014). 9 The independent variable is the MPC’s estimate of the hours gap. 10 See Bell and Blanchflower (2011, 2013) for a discussion of the role of underemployment in the UK economy since the crisis.

   10 BIS central bankers’ speeches To give a sense of its implications, imagine the level of slack were currently around 2% and was only gradually eroded over the forecast. Chart 18 shows the resulting path of inflation and wage growth. Inflation and wage growth are both materially weaker: at the two-year horizon, they are around 0.2 percentage points lower than in the MPC’s February Inflation Report.   Each of these three explanations of the wage puzzle is empirically plausible. If some weight is given to the final two explanations, the risks to future wage growth and inflation would be skewed to the downside, not only in the short-term but at longer horizons too.11  (b) Inflation expectations  A complementary explanation for the wage puzzle, which goes in the same direction, is that inflation expectations have shifted downwards. To the extent these weaker expectations shape firms’ wage-bargaining and price-setting behaviour, this would impart downwards persistence into wage and inflation dynamics.  There is an array of inflation expectations measures covering different sectors – households, companies, financial markets – and horizons – short and longer term. All of these measures have fallen over the course of the past two years, as actual inflation has fallen, though often by differing amounts. Among households, one-year-ahead inflation expectations, as reported by Citigroup, have fallen by 120bp over the past year. At the five to ten year horizon, they have fallen by around 30bp (Chart 19). Shorter-term expectations are around 1.5 percentage points, and longer-term expectations around 1 percentage point, below their pre-crisis averages. Over the same period, households’ inflation expectations from the Bank/NOP survey have fallen by 90bp, 60bp and 50bp respectively at the one, two and five year horizons. Chart 20 looks at the term structure of expected inflation by households from the Bank/NOP survey, relative to the past and the Bank’s forecasts.12 The term structure of expected inflation is currently lower than at any stage since the crisis. Moreover, household inflation expectations are significantly below 2% at the two-year horizon and, to a lesser extent, thereafter. That means it is unclear, at present, whether household inflation expectations are consistent with the Bank hitting the inflation target.                                                  11 The MPC’s February Inflation Report included a small downside skew to the inflation fan chart, but this did not extend to two years.  12 These have been adjusted to take into account the average difference between perceptions of the level of current inflation and actual inflation.

Turning to financial market measures of inflation expectations, two-year ahead forward inflation rates have fallen by around 40bp over the past year and 5-year ahead expectations by the same amount. This appears to have been, to a degree, a global phenomenon, with forward inflation rates also falling in the US and euro-area (Chart 21).  Chart 22 looks at the term structure of RPI inflation implied by inflation swap rates. Inflation is near the bottom of its distribution over the period 2009–2013. Financial markets appear to expect inflation to remain lower for longer than in the recent past. Because the period 2009–2013 was associated with higher than target levels of inflation, financial market inflation expectations may still be broadly consistent with the Bank’s inflation target. 01234520062008201020122014Per centCitigroup 1 year aheadCitigroup 5-10 years ahead01234562000200320062009201220152018Vintage Series (2009 - 2014)Feb 2015 IRCPI DataNOP Feb 2015Per cent

Data from May 2012 to  January 2013 are excluded due to uncertainty about proposed changes in RPI methodology, which temporarily affected expectations of the RPI-CPI wedge.  On either measure, inflation expectations have fallen over the past year at all horizons. At longer-term horizons, that is difficult to reconcile with global disinflationary trends having been the result of one-off falls in global prices. Measured expectations suggest that lower inflation is expected to persist. To the extent this affected wage and price-setting, those expectations could become self-fulfilling. A number of plausible explanations for a shift in longer-horizon inflation expectations are possible. One is greater slack in the economy than is currently assumed in the MPC’s central projections. A second is doubt about the ability of monetary policymakers to boost inflation – for example, because of the constraint of the zero lower bound on interest rates. A third explanation is greater expected persistence in low global price pressures. One factor that could potentially depress global prices on a persistent basis is a shortfall in global demand relative to supply. As Chart 23 shows, the IMF estimates the global output gap currently to be around 2%. It is only forecast to close by 2019. This might be expected to exert global disinflationary pressure for the foreseeable future.13 A final factor, with particular relevance to the UK over the past two years, is the exchange rate. Sterling’s effective exchange rate has appreciated by around 15% over that period and by around 3% since the start of the year. A mechanical model treatment of the appreciation this year would imply inflation in the UK, at a two year horizon, would be around 0.2 percentage points lower. What explains sterling’s appreciation and might it continue?  Over the past few years, there has been a positive relationship between countries’ effective exchange rates and news about demand relative to overseas competitors (Chart 24). Positive output surprises have increased the attraction of a currency relative to its competitors, including by increasing the chances of a rise in relative interest rates.                                                  13 I discussed the longer-term global growth outlook in a previous speech (Haldane (2014)).  -0.8-0.7-0.6-0.5-0.4-0.3-0.2-0.100.10.2Mar 2014Sep 2014Mar 2015UKEuro-areaUSPercentagepoints2.02.53.03.54.04.52345678910111213141516171819205th to 95th percentile (2009-13)Interquartile range (2009-13)Unconditional mean (2009-13)LatestYears aheadPer cent
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 13 This is a plausible explanation for the recent appreciation of sterling and the dollar, with positive demand and interest rate surprises in the UK and US relative to the euro-area and Japan. Indeed, those latter countries have in addition embarked on programmes of asset purchase which might have intensified downward pressures on euro and yen assets. This decoupling of the relative demand and monetary policy positions of the UK and US on the one hand, and the euro-area and Japan on the other, might have on-going implications for exchange rate movements. If these trends continued, they could result in some further appreciation of sterling and the dollar relative to the euro and yen, which would tend to increase disinflationary pressures in the UK and US.

Notes: Domestic demand series show revisions to average domestic demand growth relative to main trading partners.  With inflation expectations having adjusted, how might this affect wage and inflation behaviour? Table 1 shows estimates of two estimated Phillips curves, which include the typical wage-determinants, such as productivity, but also include (lagged) measures of inflation expectations for households (at a 2-year horizon) and financial markets (at a 5-year horizon). Both expectations measures are statistically significant in explaining wage growth. Every one percentage point fall in inflation expectations results in a similarly-sized fall in wage growth the next period. With household expectations having fallen 90bp, and financial market expectations by 40bp over the past year, this implies they would be exerting a significant drag on wage growth at present. That is consistent with survey evidence from the Bank’s agents, whose contacts cite falling inflation expectations as the most important factor currently holding back wage settlements.14                                                  14 From the recent Agents’ survey on pay and labour costs (Bank of England (2015a)). -4-3-2-10123456-4-3-2-1012342000200320062009201220152018Global output gap - UK wtd (rhs)Global output gap - PPP wtd (rhs)World export prices - UK wtd (lhs)PercentPercent-10-5051015-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.5Apr-13Aug-13Dec-13Apr-14Aug-14UK DD (RHS)EA DD (RHS)US DD (RHS)€ERI (LHS)£ERI (LHS)$ERI (LHS)ppPer cent

It is possible to simulate the effects of lower inflation expectations on the MPC’s February Inflation Report projections using the estimated wage relationships from Table 1, together with the Bank’s general equilibrium forecasting model.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 15 question is what, if any, monetary policy response might be appropriate as insurance against those downside risks. One insurance device comes from the specification of the inflation target itself. Even if the risks to inflation are asymmetric, central banks’ inflation targets typically are not. This reduces the risk of monetary policy imparting a “deflationary bias”. The MPC’s own mandate is crystal clear: deviations above and below the 2% inflation target are to be treated symmetrically. In its Open Letter to the Chancellor earlier this year, the MPC made clear it would act symmetrically to meet the inflation target.15 A second insurance policy against downside inflation risk comes from clearly specifying the horizon over which inflation is expected to return to target following a deviation. Provided that horizon is credible, this reduces the risk of inflationary expectations becoming dislodged from the target on a persistent basis.  In the UK, the inflation-targeting regime requires the MPC to specify the horizon over which it expects inflation to return to target if it deviates by more than one percentage point. In its Open Letter earlier this year, the MPC stated that it judged it appropriate to set policy so that inflation would likely return to target within two years. That was intended to provide a clear horizon for the MPC’s actions and as an anchor for inflation expectations.16 A third potential source of policy insurance comes from making clear that, were it necessary on inflationary grounds at the two-year horizon, monetary policy could be eased further. If monetary policy were perceived to be constrained to the downside – for example, because of the zero lower bound on interest rates – that could affect agents’ perceptions of the distribution of inflation risk, which would be skewed to the downside.  At the time of its Open Letter, the MPC stated that it had a variety of tools available to ease policy, should that prove necessary. That included re-starting asset purchases (Quantitative Easing or QE) and cutting interest rates from their current level of 0.5% towards zero. The latter reflected a re-assessment by the MPC of the relative costs and benefits of a rate cut.  Back in 2009, the MPC’s judgement was that the benefits of cutting rates below 0.5% were probably outweighed by their costs, in terms of the negative impact on financial sector resilience and lending. With the financial sector now stronger, the MPC judges there may be greater scope to cut rates below 0.5%. This change in assessment could itself have had some impact in reducing the downside risks to inflation expectations. To see that, consider two inflation fan charts based on simulations from the Bank’s macro-economic model.17 Monetary policy is set according to a policy rule, which weights deviations of inflation from target and output from trend. These rules only differ in their assumed lower interest rate bound.18  Chart 26 shows the inflation fan chart assuming an effective lower interest rate bound of 0.5%, whereas Chart 27 shows it with an effective lower interest rate bound of zero. Both these fan charts are negatively skewed. But by reducing the lower bound, this skew is reduced significantly. For example, at a two-year horizon the probability of deflation is reduced from around 20% to around 10%.                                                  15 Bank of England (2015b). 16 Bank of England (2015b). 17 Because these fan charts are based on stochastic simulations, they do not match precisely the fan charts in the Inflation Report, which are based on the MPC’s best collective judgement of the balance of risks. 18 To keep things simple, the simulation does not consider the effects of QE, though in principle this could also be used to boost demand and inflation expectations. 
   16 BIS central bankers’ speeches Essentially, a lower effective bound gives the central bank more room for manoeuvre when responding to downside inflation news. Indeed, if this cushion gets internalised in expectations, it reduces the probability of disinflationary dynamics taking hold in the first place.   Chart 26: Annual CPI inflation with an effective lower bound of 0.5% Chart 27: Annual CPI inflation with an effective lower bound of 0%  Source: Bank calculations.   A final, and the most conservative, insurance policy against disinflationary risks would be to ease monetary policy pre-emptively. Even if the modal view of expected inflation is for it to return to target over the planned horizon, mean expected inflation will be lower if risks are skewed to the downside. Provided policymakers care about these risks, there is then a case for setting policy in response to mean, rather than modal, inflation expectations.19  This option is not a hypothetical one. Already during the course of less than three months this year, more than 25 central banks internationally have eased policy through a combination of lower interest rates, currency adjustments or unconventional methods.  Here in the UK the situation is somewhat different, with activity growing pretty strongly and slack being eroded. The MPC’s best collective judgement is that interest rates are more likely than not to rise over the forecast horizon. Recent surveys of professional forecasters suggest they believe, unanimously, that the next rise in UK rates is likely to be upwards.                                                  19 For example, a simple approximation to the assumption that policymakers care about the risks to the inflation outlook is the use of a “quadratic loss function” to characterise preferences over alternative outcomes. One implication of that approximation is that policymakers should care about the mean path of inflation (see Svensson (2002)). Policymakers who take into account the risks associated with uncertainty over the structure of the economy (such as those discussed earlier in this speech) should care about the entire distribution of inflation (Svensson and Williams (2005)). -4-3-2-101234562010201220142016Per cent-4-3-2-101234562010201220142016Per cent
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 17 But financial market participants have a more nuanced view. They currently assign a roughly 15% probability to UK interest rates being cut over the next 12 months, versus a 40% probability of a rise (Chart 28). The most likely outcome, in their view, is that rates will not change over the next year. I do not currently see an immediate case for a policy change in either direction. If one were required, given the asymmetry of inflation risks, I think the chances of a rate rise or cut are broadly evenly balanced. In other words, my view would be that policy may need to move off either foot in the immediate period ahead, depending on which way risks break.  As a thought experiment, imagine policy were not set by the MPC but instead by algorithm.  Specifically, this algorithm sets rates to minimise deviations of inflation from target and output from trend, using the Bank’s forecasting model, COMPASS, to simulate the effect of alternative policy paths.20 What would it suggest was the optimal policy path given these preferences and the projections in the February Inflation Report? This is shown in Chart 29. With the lower bound set at zero, the optimal path for interest rates would involve them being cut in the short-run towards zero for around a year, before then roughly following the market yield curve. This results in inflation and output returning to target sooner than in the February Inflation Report, at the cost of a slight over-shoot thereafter. Even without any asymmetry in risks to the inflation outlook, a case can be made for policy easing today.                                                  20 The algorithm also puts some weight on smoothing of the interest rate path.

Were downside risks to inflation to materialise, this case is strengthened. Chart 30 shows the optimal policy paths if we assume the starting level of slack is larger in line with Chart 18.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 19 policy credibility cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, there are upside as well as downside risks to the inflation outlook. Nonetheless, these experiments are in my view the right baseline when assessing the appropriate policy stance today. Conclusion Inflation has dropped like a stone over the past year, to close to zero. This largely, but not wholly, reflects external forces. On the MPC’s central view, inflation will remain close to zero in the near-term, before rising to reach the inflation target over a two-year horizon. The risks to inflation at that horizon are plainly two-sided. But my personal view is that these risks are skewed to the downside. In my view, that means policy needs to stand ready to move off either foot in the period ahead to meet the symmetric inflation target. Thank you.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sayuri Shirai: Shifting toward a moderately inflationary economy in Japan – overview of firms’ and households’ inflation expectations Speech by Ms Sayuri Shirai, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at Bruegel, Brussels, 4 March 2015; the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 6 March 2015, and the Bank of England, London, 10 March 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech or on the Bank of Japan’s website I. Introduction It is a great honor to have this opportunity to speak to you today about Japan's current monetary policy. With the aim of achieving its 2 percent price stability target, the Bank of Japan (hereafter the Bank) adopted quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in April 2013. QQE was expanded further in October 2014. This was because of the potential risk that a decline in the consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate – driven by somewhat weak domestic demand following the consumption tax hike and a substantial decline in crude oil prices – may have exerted downward pressure on inflation expectations, thereby undermining the positive developments in wage negotiations and firms’ price-setting behavior. In my view, the QQE expansion was important to ensure a virtuous cycle from income to spending. Thereafter, crude oil prices dropped further and inflation has continued to decline, but domestic demand has continued its moderate recovery trend. Moreover, the Bank believes that inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat long-term perspective. Nominal and real incomes are expected to rise, and thus the rate of increase in the CPI is expected to become positive once drops in crude oil prices stall and prices subsequently increase moderately. Low inflation also prevails in Europe. In the euro area, the rate of increase in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) turned negative in December 2014 mainly as a result of the decline in crude oil prices. Some indicators of inflation expectations have also decreased. The European Central Bank (ECB) has undertaken additional unconventional monetary easing measures in January 2015 similar to those adopted by the Bank. The common features are (1) large-scale purchases of various financial assets (mainly sovereign bonds) as a main pillar and (2) a long-term conditional lending facility, where the amount of lending to financial institutions depends on the increased lending volume by those institutions to the private sector (Chart 1). In this low-inflation environment, one of a central bank's main tasks is avoiding deflation in Europe and conquering deflation in Japan. Bearing this in mind, I will review the Bank’s outlook for economic activity and prices over the past two years and explain my opinions on the upside and downside risks with the latest baseline scenario. In addition, I will discuss developments related to inflation expectations in Japan. II. The bank’s outlook for economic activity and prices and risk assessment A. The bank’s baseline scenario The Bank presents quarterly forecasts on real GDP and core CPI (all items less fresh food), prepared by the nine members of the Policy Board, on a year-on-year basis for the next three years (currently, up to fiscal 2016). Chart 2 shows the median, minimum, and maximum forecasts of the majority of policy board members for the selected four forecast points: (1) April 2013 (the month when QQE was adopted); (2) April 2014 (a year after adoption); (3) October 2014 (the latest month of the publication of the biannual Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices); and (4) January 2015 (the latest forecast point). As the median forecast is often regarded as mostly reflecting the Bank’s baseline scenario, I will proceed with my explanations on the Bank’s baseline scenario based on that median. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  If one reviews the Bank’s medium-term forecasts on economic activity and prices, it is evident that there were rather large downward revisions over that period (Chart 2). The same is also true of my medium-term relatively cautious forecasts, which have been consistently lower than the median for both real GDP growth and core CPI inflation since the introduction of QQE in April 2013. It is natural for a central bank to revise its forecasts given changes in assumptions with respect to domestic and external conditions. Nevertheless, since the revisions have been large, I feel it necessary to provide a clear explanation for these developments. Thus, I will provide my views in this area in the following sections. B. Revisions of the bank’s outlook for economic activity Downward revisions on growth forecasts for fiscal 2014  In Chart 2, one feature that may attract your attention is the large revisions made on economic growth for fiscal 2014 – from 1.4 percent in the April 2013 forecast point to minus 0.5 percent most recently. Four main reasons may be given here. First, the downward revision took place mainly owing to the greater-than-expected decline in private spending caused by the consumption tax hike in April 2014 as well as the weaker-than-expected subsequent recovery pace. The declines in private consumption (especially durable goods) and residential investment are attributable both to a reaction to the front-loaded increase prior to the tax hike and to a decline in real (disposable) income, mainly associated with the tax hike. The adverse impact of the tax hike turned out to be greater than projected – perhaps because it was difficult to grasp the structural changes in the economic and social structures that occurred after the previous tax hike in 1997. Those changes included the following: (1) an increase in the number of pensioners and a temporary cut in pension benefits in fiscal 2013–15 (owing to dissolution of the special level of pension benefits); and (2) a continued decline and resultant low level of per-capita nominal income that is prevalent even after the wage increase since fiscal 2014 (as a result of the growing number of nonregular workers and the long spell of restrained wage growth for regular workers). In this regard, I have repeatedly emphasized that the Bank should recognize the pace of improvement in the employment and income situation as a downside risk. It is clear that this risk has materialized and played a major role in the downward revision of the Bank’s outlook. In other words, a decline in domestic demand as a result of a real income drop (the Keynesian effect) appears to have exceeded an increase in domestic demand driven by the improved sentiment toward the sustainability of the fiscal balance and the social security system (the non-Keynesian effect). In addition, bad weather conditions adversely affected private consumption in July-October 2014. Thereafter, however, private consumption started to recover gradually as the adverse impact of the tax hike waned. Residential investment also appears to have more or less bottomed out. Second, the sharp depreciation of the yen brought only a limited gain in export volume, thus failing to offset a substantial decline in domestic demand caused by the tax hike. The tepid export performance was due to the following: (1) a shift to overseas production, which was accelerated in the phase of the yen’s sharp appreciation; (2) a loss in price competitiveness in some manufacturing sectors; and (3) weak recovery of global demand. The limited growth in export volume produced few benefits for manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which generally operate as suppliers of parts and intermediate goods to larger domestic manufacturing firms; the latter gained profits partly driven by the valuation effect. Since the second half of 2014, meanwhile, the export volume has begun to rise moderately, reflecting a gain in price competitiveness and the relatively strong economic recovery in the United States. Third, while the above two factors were the major reasons for the downward revisions, business fixed investment also did not rise as much as projected. This was partly because the end of support for some widely-used software programs and tightening of gas emission 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  regulations applied to construction machinery produced a front-loaded increase in purchases of personal computers and construction machinery before April 2014; this was followed by a subsequent decline in such purchases. Moreover, some firms postponed their plans to expand business fixed investment owing to the greater-than-expected accumulated inventory (especially consumer durable goods). Currently, however, investment continues to recover, inventory stock has begun to fall, and industrial production has started to rise. Fourth, the potential economic growth rate has trended downward historically, and it still remains below 0.5 percent despite a moderate recent increase (Chart 3). This may be one of the reasons that according to various opinion surveys, many households have not felt signs of economic recovery. That could be contributing to the sluggish pace of domestic demand recovery. The decrease in potential economic growth is considered to be the consequence of demographics, a deceleration in total factor productivity (TFP) growth, and a decline in capital stock (driven by delayed investment). Moreover, the unemployment rate has already dropped to around 3 percent – a level closer to the natural unemployment rate – and along with the decline in the working-age population, the labor shortage is increasingly evident. The labor shortage has favorably contributed to creation of new employment and nominal income growth; however, it has also incurred constraints on economic growth by allowing mainly SMEs and firms in nonmetropolitan areas to lose the opportunity to expand or continue their businesses. For example, owing to a severe shortage of skilled workers and engineers, the construction sector was prevented from adequately expanding the volume of their building construction starts in response to the front-loaded order placement of public investment in April-June 2014. Instead, this sector faced a rapid increase in the unit operating price caused by rising personnel expenses and cost of construction materials. Regarding residential investment, a decline in the real interest rate generated by QQE helped stimulate potential demand for mortgage loans. Conversely, an increase in housing prices caused by rising construction costs partially discouraged residential investment by ordinary households. Nonetheless, let me stress that the economic growth rate for fiscal 2014 could have been even lower without QQE. Corporate profits as well as the employment and income situation might have been less favorable than at the current level. QQE has brought negative real interest rates and promoted the following: (1) the wealth effect, for example through stocks and real estate; (2) the diversification of financing sources for firms; and (3) a correction of the yen’s excessive appreciation (Chart 4). These effects, in turn, have given rise to various positive developments by activating firms’ fixed investment and pricing behavior, financial institutions’ lending and investment behavior, individual investors’ incentives to manage financial assets, and inbound tourism. Therefore, although there were downward revisions to the Bank’s economic outlook, I believe that the effectiveness of QQE should not be questioned. Upward revisions of growth forecasts for fiscal 2015 and 2016 By contrast, the Bank’s forecast on economic growth for fiscal 2015 was adjusted upward significantly from 1.5 percent in the April 2013 forecast point to 2.1 percent in the most recent forecast. The upward revision is natural since it reflects the adjustment process of returning from the bigger-than-expected decline in the previous year. In addition, as for reasons why degree of upward revision was particularly large in the latest January 2015 forecast, I personally view that the following four factors were incorporated: (1) improvement in corporate profits and the resultant greater active business fixed investment (owing to a crude oil price drop and the lagged impact of the yen’s further depreciation since November 2014); (2) gradual recovery overseas (owing to a crude oil price drop) and the resultant positive effects on exports from Japan; (3) an increase in real income and resultant expansion of private consumption (driven by a crude oil price drop and the postponement of the second round of the consumption tax hike); and (4) expected positive effects from the government’s economic measures based on the supplementary budget for fiscal 2014. The most recent 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  forecast on economic growth for fiscal 2016 was also revised upward to 1.6 percent, partly because of a shift of the front-loaded increase in spending from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 as a result of the postponement of the second round of the tax hike. I project that the potential growth rate will rise gradually toward somewhat below 1 percent by the end of fiscal 2016. This will occur mainly through an accumulation of capital stock, an improvement in TFP growth, and a reallocation of the labor force – through corporate sector restructuring and greater focus on higher value-added goods and services. It is also expected that the government will make greater efforts in implementing growth strategies and reforms aimed at promoting greater labor participation by female and elderly persons. C. Revisions of the bank’s outlook for prices Let me now address the Bank’s outlook for prices. The Bank’s forecast on the rate of increase in the core CPI for fiscal 2014 was revised downward from 1.4 percent in the April 2013 forecast point to 0.9 percent in the most recent forecast (Chart 2). The downward revision was due to the following: (1) the greater-than-expected base effect; (2) the delayed improvement in the output gap, which had seen an unexpected deterioration for two consecutive quarters since April-June 2014, although it was at around zero percent (Chart 3); (3) a slower-than-expected increase in inflation expectations; and (4) a decline in crude oil prices since around July 2014. These factors delayed the timing for the rate of inflation to resume the rising trend from fiscal 2014 to the latter half of fiscal 2015. The adjustment for fiscal 2014 also contributed to the forecast on the rate of inflation for fiscal 2015, which was revised downward significantly from 1.9 percent in the April 2013 forecast point to 1 percent in the most recent forecast – primarily because of the decline in crude oil prices. The Bank currently estimates that the contribution of energy items will be in the range of minus 0.7 percent to minus 0.8 percent of the core CPI. It is projected that downward pressure on prices caused by crude oil price drops will diminish gradually toward the middle of fiscal 2015. Subsequently, the rate of inflation is projected to accelerate sharply from around the second half of fiscal 2015 and approach close to around 2 percent by the end of the fiscal year for several reasons. First, the pace of improvement in the output gap will be greater than that envisaged in the April 2013 forecast point due to upward revisions on the economic growth forecast. Second, there will be the lagged impact of the yen’s further depreciation from November 2014. Third, the pace of the increase in inflation expectations will also be greater than initially projected, once it resumes its rising trend. In other words, the forecasts for fiscal 2014 and 2015 reflect the Bank’s view that the underlying price developments will remain intact. First, though the effect from the decline in crude oil prices is considered temporary, its positive support for economic activities will result in an improvement in the output gap, thereby eventually reinforcing longer-term upward pressure on core CPI inflation. Second, while inflation expectations inferred from market data had exhibited a decrease in recent months, as in the United States and Europe, those inflation expectations inferred from various surveys remain roughly constant. Third, spring wage negotiations for fiscal 2015 are currently ongoing. The Japan Trade Union Confederation demanded an over 2 percent increase in base salary, and the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations expressed its willingness to make the greatest efforts to raise wages. These positive developments may be a sign that firms’ and households’ price perceptions and related economic behavior are gradually adjusting to a moderately inflationary environment. It is expected that these forces will generate sufficient upward pressures on prices such that the rate of inflation will accelerate to around 2 percent by the end of fiscal 2015. This is why the Bank maintains the view that this rate is likely to reach about 2 percent around the middle of the projection period, that is, in or around fiscal 2015. The forecast for fiscal 2016 thus remains largely unchanged with the rate of increase in the core CPI exceeding 2 percent. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  D. Risk factors related to the bank’s baseline scenario Next, let me explain my views on the upside and downside risks that are important as factors that may affect the Bank’s latest outlook. Regarding risks related to the Bank’s outlook on economic activity, I pay particular attention to external factors, including unstable financial and commodity markets and economic developments abroad, which may work both as upside and downside risks. In Europe, there is uncertainty regarding the impact of drops in crude oil prices, debt problems, low inflation, and the geopolitical issues on business fixed investment and employment conditions. In the United States, the economic recovery is solid. The normalization process of the monetary policy by the Federal Reserve is notable, especially with regard to its effect on the domestic economy and markets, as well as global capital flows and economies. The continued economic recovery in the United States with a smooth implementation of the exit policy and a moderate increase in crude oil prices will likely generate upside risks. Regarding the risks associated with domestic factors, I believe that there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the extent of the increase in business fixed investment and domestic consumption in response to higher corporate profits and real income growth. First, it may take some time to improve significantly the sentiments of households that are facing difficulties following a sharp drop in real income in fiscal 2014. Second, households may allocate a higher portion of their increased income to savings if they regard it as a temporary windfall gain and do not expect future permanent income growth. Third, households’ and firms’ economic growth expectations may not rise unless the government’s growth strategies make progress. Concerns over the sustainability of the social security system and fiscal balance may undermine households’ and firms’ incentives for spending. In this respect, some local governments, firms, and financial institutions are gradually taking advantage of the accommodative financial environment generated by QQE and the government’s economic policy and structural reforms to energize the local economy and firms’ competitiveness and innovation. Whether remarkable progress will be made remains uncertain – both in terms of upside and downside risks. Turning to my views on risks related to the Bank’s outlook for prices, I pay particular attention to the following three types of risks. First, the crude oil price decline may not only lower the prices directly through a reduction in imported energy prices, it may also lower prices indirectly, through a decrease in overall imported prices caused by global disinflation. Second, though a rise in income (nominal and real) and the resultant improvement in households’ sentiments may make it easier for firms to charge higher sales prices, some firms may lower or contain sales prices to acquire greater market share in the presence of fierce domestic competition. Third, inflation expectations may remain sluggish throughout fiscal 2015 so that the timing for these expectations to resume rising may be delayed. Alternatively, these expectations could become unstable because those of households in particular are heavily affected by the actual price movements of daily necessities and gasoline, as I will indicate later. Finally, in my view, given that QQE was already expanded in October 2014, a temporary reduction in the core CPI inflation is acceptable as long as the underlying price developments and recovery process in domestic demand continue. Nonetheless, the timing of a rate of inflation approaching around 2 percent now entails greater uncertainty, including the possible delay from the Bank’s latest forecast. III. Overview of inflation expectations in Japan A. Underlying price developments Earlier, I mentioned that the Bank regards underlying price developments as having remained unchanged despite a fall in actual inflation rate. Here, I will first explain more clearly what the Bank means by underlying price developments. Generally, underlying price developments are assessed by the output gap and medium- to long-term inflation expectations, and they are typically monitored through the core CPI – assessed after 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  excluding volatile items (that is, fresh food in the case of the Bank). Of course, these relationships are reflected in the trend in income growth and firms’ price-setting behavior. However, the core CPI is not the only indicator monitored. The Bank looks at a wide range of other price indicators, including the 10 percent trimmed mean, the Laspeyres chain index, the ratio of items whose prices are rising to core CPI items (the rising-CPI item ratio), and the breakdown items of the CPI. Producer price index, services producer price index, and commodity prices are also closely monitored. The core CPI, 10 percent trimmed mean, and Laspeyres chain index have shown a decline since the middle of 2014. By contrast, the rising-CPI item ratio has remained unchanged (Chart 5). In practice, whether the underlying price developments remain unchanged could be assessed by observing whether (1) the prices of a wide range of items are increasing, (2) such a rise is persistent, and (3) medium- to long-term inflation expectations have on the whole increased or at least remained stable. Currently, the rising-CPI item ratio indicates that a persistent increase in prices is widely observed for about 60 percent of the items covered by the core CPI. On medium- to long-term inflation expectations, some market-based indicators – such as the break-even inflation (BEI) and inflation swap rates – declined over the past months, but have become constant or begun to rise recently (Chart 6). Moreover, the survey-based indicators of firms, households, and economists have remained more or less stable, as noted earlier (Chart 7). B. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations Major central banks have clear inflation targets and conduct monetary policy so as to achieve around 2 percent in the medium term. Under the so-called flexible inflation-targeting framework, a temporary deviation of actual inflation from the target is accepted. This is permissible as long as there is a natural tendency for actual inflation to converge to around 2 percent. In assessing whether such a tendency prevails, medium- to long-term inflation expectations play an essential role. If these expectations remain stable (or “anchored”) at around 2 percent, actual inflation is likely to converge to around 2 percent – even if actual inflation fluctuates around the target. In this environment, wage negotiations and firms’ price-setting behavior are more likely to be determined based on expectations of approximately 2 percent inflation. Such an economy could be referred to as having achieved price stability. In the case of Japan, where mild deflation has persisted over a long period, inflation expectations have not been anchored. Moreover, those inflation expectations have been volatile at around 1 percent. Thus, one of the Bank’s challenges is to raise and anchor such expectations toward around 2 percent. A central bank generally makes a judgment on the movements of medium- to long-term inflation expectations using several indicators; this is because the levels of inflation expectations and their directions of movement often differ. This reflects the fact that (1) each indicator entails various, specific biases, and (2) some indicators target different price indexes. With (1), for example, households’ inflation expectations tend to be upward-biased since households always expect that the price level will increase, as will be discussed later. By contrast, large firms’ expectations on sales prices tend to be downward-biased because they tend to make cautious management plans. With (2), for example, the Opinion Survey on the General Public’s Views and Behavior compiled by the Bank asked respondents the price outlook referring to “overall prices of goods and services the respondents purchase.” By contrast, the Bank’s Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) explicitly refers to the CPI when asking firms about their outlook on general prices. Moreover, the BEI and inflation swap rates target the core CPI, but they include both inflation expectations and various premiums. Chart 8 provides basic information about survey based indicators on short-term (one year or less) and medium- to long-term (over one year) inflation expectations. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  In achieving price stability, what matters most are the inflation expectations of firms and households, as well as their associated economic behavior. I will therefore concentrate on these inflation expectations here. C. Developments in inflation expectations of firms The Bank’s quarterly Tankan asks about 10,000 firms with at least 20 million yen in capital about their outlook regarding sales prices (rate of price changes relative to the current level) and general prices (annual percentage rate changes) for three projection periods: one year, three years, and five years ahead. These questionnaires have been incorporated since the March 2014 survey, and so currently four forecast points are available: March, June, September, and December 2014. Since the amount of data acquired is not yet sufficient, some caution is required in interpreting the results. The respondents are also decomposed into four groups (large manufacturing, large nonmanufacturing, small manufacturing, and small nonmanufacturing). I will now share with you in the following sections my preliminary observations on the survey results. Since the findings that I will describe remain largely unchanged across the forecast points, I will focus on the latest (December 2014) forecast.  Inflation expectations for sales prices (one, three, and five years ahead) The outlook on sales prices is chosen from ten options from “around plus 20 percent or higher” to “around minus 20 percent or lower” (categorized in 5 percent increments) and “Don’t know.” The average inflation outlook on sales prices for “all firms, all industries” is 1 percent for one year, 1.7 percent for three years, and 2 percent for five years ahead, and shows a rising trend relative to the current level. It should be noted that these figures refer to the rate of changes relative to the current level, not the annual percentage rate change. Thus, taking the difference between these intertemporal figures gives a 0.7 percent increase for three years relative to one year ahead and a 0.3 percent increase for five years relative to three years ahead. Namely, the scale of the sales price increase tends to fall as the projection period moves from one to five years ahead. Another caution is that the average outlook figures are obtained from the sample pool after excluding the “Don’t know” respondents. So the average outlook figures are based on a limited number of respondents – especially for the outlook over three and five years ahead. • First, large manufacturing firms expect on average that sales prices will remain unchanged from the current level in three years’ time (plus 0.1 percent) and will fall from the current level in five years’ time (minus 0.2 percent). This shows a sharp contrast from the three other groups, all of which expect a rising sales price level from the current level (Chart 9). In large manufacturing, the declining price expectation is evident for five years ahead, especially among processing sectors, such as electrical and transportation machinery. Given that these sectors face fierce competition, large firms in these sectors are more likely to formulate their business plans conservatively or envision their future sales prices without an increase. • Second, regardless of the scale of firms, nonmanufacturing firms tend to expect their future sales prices to be higher than manufacturing ones. Among large nonmanufacturing firms, relatively higher sales prices are expected in the construction & real estate sectors for three years ahead and in the construction & real estate, retailing, and accommodations & eating & drinking services sectors for five years ahead. With small nonmanufacturing firms, relatively higher sales prices are expected in the construction & real estate and accommodations & eating & drinking services sectors for three years ahead and in the construction & real estate, wholesaling & retailing, accommodations & eating & drinking services, and transport & postal activities sectors for five years ahead. Some of these sectors are already facing a labor shortage, higher real estate prices in large cities, or a rise in construction materials. 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  These two observations suggest that sales prices are projected to rise in nonmanufacturing – rather than in manufacturing – and in the labor-intensive sectors. Next, I examine the three largest responses – “around plus 5 percent,” “around 0 percent,” and “Don’t know” – among the aforementioned ten options. The following additional points are observed: • Third, for “all firms, all industries,” the responses for one year ahead tend to concentrate on “around 0 percent” (from the current level); they account for about 60 percent of all responses. The next-largest responses are related to “around plus 5 percent,” which account for about 20 percent. By contrast, the responses for three years ahead are more widely spread among the various options. The largest responses are for “around 0 percent” (accounting for about 30 percent), and the next two largest responses are for “around plus 5 percent” and “Don’t know” (accounting for over 20 percent each). Those three options account for about 80 percent of all responses. Regarding the responses for five years ahead, the largest responses relate to “Don’t know” (accounting for about 35 percent); the proportion of the “around 0 percent” responses drops to about 20 percent and that of the “around plus 5 percent” responses remains at over 20 percent (Chart 10-1). • Fourth, the four-group classification indicates that there are greater differences between large and small firms rather than between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. For both large and small firms, the “Don’t know” responses grow as the projection period increases from one year to five years ahead. However, the proportion of the “Don’t know” responses is greater among large than among small firms for any projection period. Small firms tend to choose the “around plus 5 percent” option more frequently than large ones (Charts 10–2, 10–3, and 10-4). In light of these responses, it may be said that small manufacturing firms find it easier to form expectations on sales prices than do large ones. This is probably because small manufacturing firms tend to project future sales prices through supplier-transaction relationships with large firms and also because they deal with limited kinds of parts and intermediate goods. Meanwhile, small nonmanufacturing firms form expectations on sales prices by taking into account an expected increase in production costs while considering relevant market prices influenced mainly by large nonmanufacturing firms. This may reflect the fact that small nonmanufacturing firms are relatively more labor intensive than large ones and are already facing a labor shortage.  Inflation expectations on general prices (one, three, and five years ahead) Let us now examine the outlook for general prices, as measured by the CPI. The responses are chosen from ten options, ranging from “around plus 6 percent or higher” to “around minus 3 percent or lower” (categorized in 1 percent increments), and “Don’t have clear views” with three sub-categories (on general prices). The average inflation outlook for “all firms, all industries” is 1.4 percent for one year, 1.6 percent for three years, and 1.7 percent for five years ahead, and shows a rising trend as the projection period increases from one to five years ahead (Chart 7). I will now elaborate on three observations on these results. • First, the four-group classification reveals that the differences in the projected inflation level are greater between large and small firms than between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. Large firms project on average 1.1 percent for one year ahead and 1.2 percent for both three and five years ahead; and small firms on average report about 1.7 percent for one year, 1.8 percent for three years, and 1.9 percent for five years ahead. So while they both basically project a rising trend, small firms have higher levels of inflation expectations (Chart 11).  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  By focusing on the four largest responses – “around plus 2 percent,” “around plus 1 percent,” “around 0 percent,” and “Don’t have clear views” – among the aforementioned options, the following points are observed: • Second, among “all firms, all industries,” the general price outlook for one year ahead is relatively widespread among the options compared with the sales price outlook. The largest “around plus 1 percent” responses account for about 30 percent of total responses, followed by the “around plus 2 percent” and “around 0 percent” responses (accounting for about 20 percent each). The “Don’t have clear views” responses account for approximately 15 percent of total responses. On the outlook for three years ahead, the “Don’t have clear views” response increases to about 30 percent. The next-largest responses are “around plus 1 percent” and “around plus 2 percent” (each accounting for about 20 percent). This pattern becomes more apparent with the outlook for five years ahead. The proportion of the “Don’t have clear views” responses rises to approximately 40 percent; the “around plus 1 percent” and “around plus 2 percent” responses both drop to about 15 percent. From one to five years ahead, the proportion of “Don’t have clear views” responses are greater than that of the “Don’t know” response for sales price outlook  (Chart 12–1). • Third, the four-group classification reveals that the “Don’t have clear views” response is greater among large than among small firms. The responses account for over 40 percent on the outlook for three years ahead and over 50 percent on that for five years. As for small firms, the proportion of “around plus 2 percent” responses is greater than that for large firms with the outlooks for one, three and five years ahead (Charts 12–2, 12–3, and 12–4).  Summary of observations related to inflation expectations of firms  Based on the aforementioned results, I will now summarize the combined observations on sales price- and general price-related inflation expectations of firms. 1. The average outlook for general prices among “all firms, all industries” indicates 1.4 percent for one year, 1.6 percent for three years, and 1.7 percent for five years ahead. However, the outlook among large firms remains largely unchanged over the same projection period. This implies that the rising trend in the outlook appears to largely reflect the outlook among small firms. Large firms also appear to make more conservative, lower projections on sales prices than small firms. 2. For both general and sales prices, the “Don’t have clear views” and “Don’t know” responses are greater among large than small firms. Large firms are likely to face a greater degree of uncertainty in their outlooks for both types of prices – probably because of the direct exposure to fierce global and domestic competition in final-product markets. By contrast, small firms tend to expect higher general and sales prices through labor shortage and high input costs because of their labor intensity and relatively low profit margins. 3. Large firms project more conservative, lower sales prices than small firms. This may in turn affect the sales prices of small firms through transaction relationships. As a result, some small firms may find it difficult to pass their rising production costs onto their sales prices, thereby squeezing their margins and profitability. This suggests that small firms will need to make greater efforts to improve margins and shift to higher value-added business models. 4. Because large firms often play a role as price setters, aggregating their sales price outlooks, especially those of processing industries whose products are close to final goods, will likely result in the true outlook for general price inflation, such as CPI inflation. If such large firms maintain their conservative, lower pricing behavior with 
   10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  respect to sales prices, the level of actual inflation in general prices may turn out to be lower than the level suggested by the average of inflation expectations for “all firms, all industries.” 5. Finally, for both general and sales prices, the “Don’t have clear views” and “Don’t know” responses account for 20 percent-40 percent for the projection for three years ahead and 30 percent-50 percent for that for five years. Moreover, greater dispersion among the responses is observed as the projection period increases. In terms of level of general price inflation, even the average of projections by small firms for five years (whose average is highest) is 1.9 percent. In this regard, it may be said that firms’ medium- to long-term inflation expectations are not yet anchored and that the Bank has only passed the halfway point on the path toward achieving the 2 percent price stability target. D. Developments in inflation expectations of households The Bank conducts the Opinion Survey on the General Public’s Views and Behavior with a sample of about 4,000 people (a little over half provide valid responses). The quarterly survey results are currently available on a consistent base since June 2006 up to its latest December 2014 survey. There are two indicators related to inflation expectations: one year (the outlook for price levels one year ahead); and five years (the outlook for the annual average change in price levels over the next five years). In addition, some other relevant price-related indicators that can be calculated using the survey data include the perception diffusion index (DI) of present price levels (the difference between perceived increase and perceived decrease responses compared with one year earlier) and the price rise tolerance DI (the difference between rather favorable and rather unfavorable responses to the price rise). I will explain the features obtained from these indicators and other relevant information derived from the survey (such as income, spending, and employment conditions DIs), starting with the present and short-term developments and proceeding to medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Attitude to the price rise (price rise tolerance) • The perception DI of present price levels appears to be inversely related to the price rise tolerance DI (Chart 13). Namely, whenever households believe that present price levels have increased compared with one year earlier, the price rise tolerance DI tends to drop or the attitude to the price rise becomes negative. The price rise tolerance DI rose from late 2009 to early 2010, when both the actual CPI and the perception DI dropped during the middle of the global financial crisis. This suggests that households accepted the price rise more favorably or found price drop more unfavorably – probably not because of the price hike per se but because of growing concerns about recession reflected in an actual price decline.  • Comparing two observation years – 2008 and 2014 – during which a comparable rise occurred in CPI inflation, the price rise tolerance DI was greater in 2014 than in 2008. This may be associated with better employment and income conditions in 2014 than in 2008. Indeed, the present income DI, the one-year-ahead income DI, and the employment conditions DI were all higher in 2014 than in 2008 (Chart 14).  Expectations for one-year inflation and relations to income and spending • The indicators for one-year inflation expectations on average remain positive – even in the phase of deflation. This suggests that households always believe that price levels one year ahead will be higher. Conversely, both the present income DI and one-year-ahead income DI remain negative. This suggests that households always consider their present income to have declined compared with one year earlier and that their income one year ahead will decrease compared with the present. This 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  implies that households always expect that their real income one year ahead will decline (Chart 15). • Meanwhile, the present spending DI remains positive, whereas the one-year-ahead spending DI remains negative (Chart 15). Namely, households have increased the present level of spending compared with one year earlier, but plan to reduce the spending level one year from now. Moreover, households tend to regard the rise in living expenses as the main reason for the increase in the current spending level when the present spending DI grows. Taking these features into account, it may be said that households plan to reduce spending one year ahead because they expect their real income to have declined by then. Generally speaking, with a rise in one-year-ahead inflation expectations, households tend to frontload their spending today and reduce their future spending to smooth the intertemporal budgetary constraint. In this regard, an increase in the present spending DI associated with the increase in one-year-ahead inflation expectations could be understood as a sign of defensive action against future price hikes. Present price perception and inflation expectations (one and five years) • Like one-year inflation expectations, the indicators for five-year inflation expectations on average remain positive. This means that households expect that price levels will rise over the next five years – even during a time of deflation (Chart 16).  • Among the following – (1) the perception of present inflation (based on the year-on-year percentage price change), (2) one-year inflation expectations, and (3) five-year inflation expectations – the fluctuations for (1) are greatest, followed by (2). Chart 16 reveals that the perception indicator grew sharply in 2008 compared with one- and five-year inflation expectations. This suggests that although households found that present prices had increased sharply in 2008 compared with one year earlier, they believed that that extreme price hike would eventually be contained. By contrast, all three indicators remained stable in 2014, with average values of around 4 percent-5 percent. • The opinion survey began a biannual questionnaire about information sources for households’ price views in September 2013. According to the most recent (September 2014) survey for both present price levels and five-year inflation expectations, “developments in prices of frequently-purchased items such as foodstuffs” was chosen as the most applicable source, followed by “developments in gasoline prices.” Over 50 percent of all respondents regarded those two options as their most relevant information sources (Chart 17). • The indicators for five-year inflation expectations remain stable. At first glance, adopting the 2 percent price stability target and QQE in 2013 appear to have exerted no significant effects on inflation expectations. However, I will return to this issue.  E. Summary of households’ inflation expectations and relation to those of firms Let me know sum up my observations on households’ inflation expectations and relate them to the expectations of firms. 1. Households’ five-year inflation expectations on average appear to remain stable at around 4 percent at first glance. However, the survey revealed that the basis for five-year inflation expectations largely depends on the prices of frequently-purchased items and gasoline – and not much from monetary policy. Thus, stable movements in inflation expectations do not necessarily mean that their medium- to long-term inflation expectations are anchored. 
   12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  2. One interesting feature is that households rely more heavily on general price-related information and various other sources with respect to five-year inflation expectations compared with perceptions of present price levels. For example, they rely relatively more heavily on “media reports on individual prices of goods and services and prices in general” and “developments in foreign exchange rates” (Chart 17). 3. In addition, the indicators for one- and five-year inflation expectations remain largely unchanged before and after adopting the 2 percent price stability target and QQE. It might appear at first glance that the effects of the monetary policy have been limited. However, the survey responses are known to have reporting biases: outliers with extreme numbers; downward rigidity or the tendency to avoid negative numbers – even when respondents expect deflation; and many responses with integers, especially multiples of five. After taking these biases into account, the modified distribution of one- and five-year inflation expectations has displayed notable changes since 2013. Namely, the skew to the deflationary side has diminished for both inflation expectations. The right tail to the inflationary side for five-year inflation expectations has contracted. As a result, the spike at around 2 percent has become sharper for both inflation expectations, which shows that households’ inflation expectations concentrated at around 2 percent (Chart 18). This may suggest that the change in the Bank’s monetary policy in 2013 has positively affected households’ inflation expectations, leading to a greater concentration of responses to about 2 percent.1 4. Households’ inflation expectations are higher than those of firms, which suggests the presence of an upward bias. This may be because of two possible reasons. One is that households and firms envisage different prices when responding to the survey questionnaire. Households are asked to respond to “overall prices of goods and services the respondents purchase,” whereas firms are asked to respond to general prices measured by the CPI. The reason households are asked in this manner is that some respondents are unfamiliar with the CPI, which makes it difficult to form an outlook based upon it. 5. The other possible reason for the upward bias is that households tend to perceive and expect higher price levels as a corollary of long-standing sluggish income growth, resulting in an anticipated tightening of household budgets. By contrast, firms tend to form conservative inflation expectations based on the surrounding economic environment and information obtained from transactions with other firms. Given that firms appear to weigh more on macro information and that some of them perceive price developments based not only on input prices but also on sales prices, their inflation expectations as a whole are more likely to be lower than those of households and more closely approximate the rate of actual CPI inflation. The most important finding is that households expect that prices will have risen one year ahead and will increase over the next five years; such an expected price rise is regarded as rather unfavorable because it is associated with an expected decline in their future real income. Partly reflecting such limited tolerance for price rises by households, large firms (manufacturing and nonmanufacturing) may tend to project a relatively conservative, lower increase in both general prices and sales prices than small firms. Households’ poor tolerance for price rises reflects the perception that their present income level has declined compared with one year earlier and also that their income level one year ahead will not increase much. To achieve the 2 percent price stability target with a sustainable increase in private spending, it is necessary for price rises to be widely accepted                                                 1 See Shunsaku Nishiguchi, Jouchi Nakajima, and Kei Imakubo, “Disagreement in Households’ Inflation Expectations and Its Evolution,” Bank of Japan Review Series 2014-E-1, March 2014. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 13  by households. This requires an improvement in current employment and income conditions as well as an increase in expectations of future income growth. In this respect, I will closely monitor favorable developments in income (nominal and real) projected for fiscal 2015 and beyond as important steps toward achieving the price stability target. IV. Concluding remarks The Bank adopted the 2 percent price stability target for the following reasons: (1) the need to maintain a sufficient buffer for inflation owing to the upward-bias problems inherent in CPI statistics; (2) the need to leave sufficient room for the conduct of flexible monetary policy by achieving a certain level of inflation in recessionary phases; and (3) the need to set a target of around 2 percent as a global standard in terms of a price stability target to avoid reemergence of excessive appreciation of the yen. In addition, the 2 percent target is essential to realize normal economic conditions, in which positive rates of nominal GDP growth occur on a sustainable basis. However, households tend to regard price level rises as unfavorable. It is not easy to promote their understanding of the Bank’s price stability target – especially since real income dropped sharply in fiscal 2014. Nonetheless, income (nominal and real) will likely rise in fiscal 2015. Therefore, it is essential for the Bank to boost the effectiveness of its communication strategy by explaining more clearly why it aims to achieve the 2 percent target and how this will improve people’s lives in the medium to long term. I will continue making further efforts in this regard. In addition, even though the Bank’s economic growth outlook for 2014 has been revised sharply downward, it is clear that Japan’s economy is currently in a far better shape than it was before the introduction of QQE. A virtuous cycle from income to spending, which is the driving force of the economy, is being maintained in the household and corporate sectors. Thus, it is crucial for the Bank to continue to support the current recovery process.  I sincerely hope that all entities will take full advantage of the opportunity afforded by the highly accommodative financial environment generated by QQE to expand their efforts toward enhancing innovation and productivity – in concert with the economic growth strategy and structural reforms implemented by the government. Thank you very much for your kind attention.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sarah Dahlgren: The importance of addressing cybersecurity risks in the financial sector Remarks by Ms Sarah Dahlgren, Executive Vice President of the Financial Institution Supervision Group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the OpRisk North America Annual Conference, New York City, 24 March 2015. *      *      * Introduction I would like to thank Operational Risk & Regulation for inviting me to speak here today. I appreciate the opportunity to address this group and kick off what looks like a very interesting and comprehensive few days of dialogue around current and future risks facing the industry. As always, my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. I will begin my remarks with a high-level overview of the progress made in recent years in addressing some of the most significant risks facing the industry following the financial crisis. I will then go on to discuss one of the areas where I see some of the biggest challenges in the road ahead. As the industry continues to adapt to and implement necessary regulatory changes, it is also adapting to and leveraging technology changes: technology changes that offer both exciting opportunities and more complex risks than – I think – we are prepared for. Progress Coming out of the financial crisis, we all knew that we needed to be better prepared for future crisis events, whatever their character, source or timing. We needed financial firms, and a financial system, that was better prepared to weather all storms. In 2011, we developed the Framework for Supervision – a framework designed to ensure we had firms and a system that were less complex, more resilient and better managed. Collectively, we have made a lot of progress since 2011 – and the industry is in much better condition relative to the pre-crisis period. But, as you all know, business does not stand still and this constant evolution results in new risks and new challenges. Before turning to one of the biggest risks or challenges I see, I want to pause and recognize two things: • First, it’s clear that progress has been made across the industry in a number of areas – particularly in making firms and the system more resilient through improvements in capital and liquidity, as well as enhancements in risk management, including capital planning and stress testing across the range of risks firms face. But, in the remaining two areas of the Framework – less complex and better managed – I think it’s safe to say that despite the fact that firms are addressing a number of outstanding issues, these areas continue to present challenges in reaching the desired end state. • Second, as I’m sure you would agree, we collectively still have quite a bit of work to do to fully implement all of the changes required under new rules and regulations. And, we must continue to devote sufficient attention and resources to complete the efforts. At the same time, though, it is important to take stock of the changes made over the past few years – for two important reasons: first, to assess the impact of those changes, both intended and unintended; and, second, to understand the contours of the “new” financial system operating under the range of new rules and regulations, both national and global in nature. Such a stocktaking is important to 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  ensure that we collectively understand how the “new” financial system is operating. Firms and supervisors will continue to face challenges and competing demands as we press, in the months and years ahead, on implementing necessary changes and assessing the “new” financial system. What the future holds One of the topics that I feel will compete for, and will deserve, a lot of attention in the foreseeable future is cybersecurity. I am often asked about my list of “things that keep me awake at night,” and I think it’s fair to say that cybersecurity is at the top of that list – as I’m sure it is for many of you in this room. In fact, I think cybersecurity is one of the topics that should be on everyone’s list – from the most senior managers and boards of directors, all the way down to line managers. Cybersecurity is not a topic or an issue just for the Information Technology staff or the CIO to address; it is a risk that isn’t exclusive in who, what or where it targets. • It is a risk that is difficult to clearly define. • It is a risk that is constantly evolving. • It is a risk that is not limited to one source. • It is a risk that is faced by every single financial firm, regardless of size or complexity. • In fact, it is a risk that is faced by every business, organization, school, church or group that uses technology. In other words, no company is immune (unless, of course, you operate an all cash business from a brick and mortar store and keep your earnings under your mattress – not something we see a lot of in today’s world). The financial sector, in particular, is under unprecedented attack from a broad spectrum of intent and attack methods that are complex, widely distributed, and increasingly interconnected. These highly dynamic systems give rise to the “new normal” – system design and architecture that needs to support rapid and compartmentalized change. So, where do we begin when we look at a risk of this magnitude? And, how do we get our arms around the many associated risks that surround it? Let me begin with what it is not. Cybersecurity is not an “Information Technology” issue. It is not a risk that can be addressed by simply having a strong IT team in place. It is not a risk that just affects a firm’s technology – it affects the business itself, in every aspect – the bottom line, reputation, processes, and so much more. However, information technology and cybersecurity are intrinsically linked. I’d like to cover both of these issues in my remaining remarks and focus on several of the underlying issues that need to be addressed. Information technology and legacy issues The first dimension is legacy: there is still a great deal of “clean-up” to do to fix longstanding technology and data issues that have built up over the years. The investments necessary are long-term and the fixes, in many cases, will take multiple years to execute. The range of issues include: systems or processes that are manual or not fully automated; asset management tools that are drastically insufficient; and business processes and models built without security requirements, to name but a few. As firms address these challenges, they must also be flexible and agile enough to keep up with the changing environment and incorporate new developments as they arise. While a number of firms have sound programs in place to address these longstanding issues, strong 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  project management and tenacity will be crucial to see them through. In addition, continued prioritization and commitment of resources, as well as support from the firm’s senior management and board of directors, are critical. I see commitment to this basic “blocking and tackling” as essential to financial institutions’ continuing to be competitive – and relevant – in the digital world. While the legacy issues need to be addressed in the near-term and quickly, we can’t hold off on addressing the vast number of issues around cyber – since cyber is upon us now. Information technology and cybersecurity The area where I will spend most of my time discussing today is cybersecurity. Suffice it to say that as I think about the kinds of risks that might cause the next crisis, cybersecurity is the one that worries me the most. While I will focus my remarks on the financial sector, my concern is not limited to the financial sector. This is much bigger than just banks or financial institutions; it includes many other sectors as well. As it relates to the financial industry in particular, the interconnectedness of firms continues to pose a particular risk to financial stability; from trading systems to settlement activities, we are at risk of a major disruption to financial stability. During the last financial crisis, we began to get a glimpse into the challenges faced as a result of interconnectedness and systemic failures. Years later, we are still faced with some of the same challenges, with only a limited view into the true complexities behind how firms are linked, connected, and ultimately intertwined to form the fabric of the financial industry. While we have begun to address other areas of systemic risk, I feel the industry as a whole is just beginning to scratch the surface of the potential system-wide impact of a significant cyber-attack. This risk can be referred to as “single point of failure.” What is this? These are areas that, despite all of the work that has already been carried out, are significantly more vulnerable than others. We need to identify where they are and focus our combined efforts on understanding their systemic impact and addressing them. I want to be very clear here. I don’t think that this isn’t a regular topic of conversation among directors, executives and managers – in fact, based on discussions I’ve had with many of you, I know that it’s quite the opposite. There is a lot of discussion within firms about the topic – and there’s quite a bit of activity more broadly that suggests that many different people are talking about cyber. There are conferences on cybersecurity every week. Consultancy firms are working with the industry on how to protect against attacks. Law enforcement agencies are investigating and cracking down on attacks and those behind them. Everyone is talking about this! And, I think that’s appropriate and necessary – this is everyone’s issue. As we engage in discussions on the subject and flesh out our plans to address this risk, there are a number of topics that are key to keep in mind. Before I go through that list, I want to provide an overview on where we, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, are in our process. While cybersecurity has been on our agenda for quite some time, and we have been dedicating resources to assessing it in large complex firms and setting expectations for smaller firms, we have elevated our efforts in recent months and have formed a dedicated team focused on further strengthening our overall supervisory approach to cybersecurity. As I mentioned at the beginning, I think we’ve done a reasonable job in developing rules and regulations to ensure firms are prepared to withstand the other types of shocks we have experienced in the past. But, cyber adds an element to planning for the next crisis that goes beyond what additional capital and liquidity, for example, can provide to the system. The newly-formed team, led by Roy Thetford, the former Information Security Officer for the Bank, will be working with our examination teams to establish a new risk-based cybersecurity assessment framework, based on best practices in the field, as well as exploring additional standards that might be set out for supervised institutions. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In addition, to further strengthen and build out our program, we will be collaborating with critical stakeholders, including experts in security and cybersecurity; financial institutions, including both banks and non-banks; critical third-party service providers; domestic regulatory bodies; enforcement agencies; and international supervisors. As we move forward with developing the framework and standards, we are reviewing current and emerging laws, regulations and guidance; further researching best practices; and identifying gaps in current assessment efforts. As we do this, we have identified a set of issues that are top of mind: 1. This is not just an IT issue As I mentioned earlier, cyber isn’t just an IT issue. I don’t think I can say this enough. It is a business issue first and foremost and needs to be tackled as such. Cyber needs to be owned by the business leaders in the firm – partnering with the experts of course. There needs to be a foundational shift in thinking at the top of the house: it needs to be a regular topic on the agenda for the board of directors; it needs to be at the top of the priority list for senior management of the firm; and it needs to be on the mind of every employee, to some extent. It needs to be part of everyone’s vocabulary and recognized as a valid threat at every level. 2. Good risk management is the foundation Good risk management and good IT practices set the foundation for a solid program to address cyber-related risk. It’s hard to imagine that a firm that doesn’t manage its IT risk well is ever going to be able to manage cyber risk well. In fact, two areas that we recently reviewed that require attention include basic IT asset management and strengthening patch and vulnerability management practices. These are necessary hygiene steps and should be a fundamental for a sound cyber security defense program. As part of good risk management, firms also need to start considering how to assess the costs of cyber and connect the pricing of cyber risk to the businesses. You must ask yourself “what is my cyber exposure?” And, you need to think about how you should price it, because until cyber is priced, it may not get the attention it needs. 3. It’s not just the banks Cyber isn’t just about the banks – it’s about the entire financial sector, as well as the connections between the financial sector and other sectors like the utilities, retail, and others. We know that every area of the industry is interconnected; and it’s not just financial firms. As the old saying goes, we are only as strong as the weakest link. In the financial system, that weak link could be a weak firm, a weak vendor, a weak point of vulnerability in a payments or clearing system, etc. A weakness in any of these areas exposes the entire system, because the interconnections mean that you are all linked to each other, to non-financial firms, and to every system that supports the operations and structure of the industry. The additional risk to keep in mind here is the growing number of unregulated firms operating in and competing in this arena. As the industry moves to overcome the risks associated with cybersecurity, you have to consider the additional vulnerabilities you are exposed to through non-regulated entities that will not be subject to the same guidance and standards. The big question lies in how you, as an industry, ensure that the ‘industry as a whole’ is safe, not just regulated entities. 4. One size does not fit all Just as firms are diverse in size, complexity and product offerings, so too are technologies, processes and systems. While some firms house all technology work internally, others outsource the entire function or a significant part of it to third-party vendors. In addition to the variety of systems used and approaches to information security within firms, as I said earlier, we have an entire subsystem that supports the financial sector and ultimately connects every firm to some extent. In response to this, we are working under the 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  assumption that there will not be a one-size-fits-all solution and the approach taken will need to be comprehensive and flexible enough to be adopted by all types of firms. 5. We are in this together Cybersecurity is an area where I believe our interests are aligned and our shared goal is two-fold. In addition to wanting to see firms that are adequately protected against cyber-attacks and prepared to respond should they occur, we are equally as concerned with the overall safety and soundness of the financial system – as a whole. No one firm or agency is going to come up with the one and only permanent solution or protection against cyber-attacks. I see how we approach cybersecurity similar to how we approached Y2K – I’m sure you all remember that. • We need an approach that everyone agrees to adopt. • We need to see more public/private partnerships in the development of that approach. • We need to come together to identify the vulnerabilities that are shared and what needs to be done. • We need to agree on a path forward and how we test it. • We need to acknowledge that, unlike Y2K, this does not have an expiration date. Cybersecurity is a “new normal.” It is going to become part of our vocabulary in nearly every exam we conduct, conversation we have with senior management, and conversation about the future of financial services. To be successful, we have to agree that we have common goals; although we can approach them from different angles and think creatively about solutions, we should all be working toward understanding the threats we are facing. The threat landscape is shifting constantly, and we are all responsible for keeping up with the changes and adapting our controls accordingly. This includes firms, systems that support the industry, third party vendors, consultants, regulators, and law enforcement. 6. We need to leverage best practices Leveraging a common set of best practices across the industry will be an important first step in closing the gap on the current vulnerabilities. Unlike the approaches taken by other supervisors to address cybersecurity concerns, our initial focus in this area is on better understanding the vulnerabilities, how firms are addressing them, what progress has been made by firms and assessing where the industry stands as a whole. Yes, we want you to address the weaknesses, but this is a lot bigger than the weaknesses identified at one firm. We will be looking to firms to leverage guidance around best practices to identify their weaknesses, and we want firms to bring forward other issues, concerns or vulnerabilities they encounter in doing so. We need to identify, as an industry, where the risks truly lie and what we are doing about them. There has been a lot of work done in this area by experts, including the NIST, the FBIIC, FINRA, PRA, FFIEC, NCUA, etc. – the list goes on. And, there are a number of sets of best practices already published. We are aware that firms have been looking for guidance on which approach to take or framework to adopt. As we review all published guidance, assess the broad volume of research that is already out there and come to consensus on an evaluation framework, we encourage firms to look at the fundamental commonalities across all best practices and build them into your ongoing/current activities. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  7. Assessing the threat To fully assess a threat or risk to a firm, we must first understand where the risk lies, who it affects, how it is defined, and what the associated costs are. In the case of assessing the risk and impact of cyber-attacks, I believe firms need to be cognizant that every business decision, every process, every change a firm makes ultimately has a cyber-related element to it. To add to the complexity of this, the firm’s self-awareness must extend beyond the four walls of their company and must also take into account the impact critical service providers have on the firm. You can outsource the service, but not the risk. Everyone should be using threat intelligence as we go about our day-to-day activities – using the potential of a cyber-attack as another filter through which we view every decision. As we think about the variables to be considered in the decision-making process, we must build in the potential for creating weaknesses, vulnerabilities or opportunities for cyber-attacks, and be aware of the associated costs. I fear that until we can assign financial consequences to cyber risks, and ensure staff are taking that into account when making decisions, we will not get the commitment needed from every level of the organization to adequately address the problem. As long as decisions are made and actions are taken without this type of assessment, we are going to see more and more of these weaknesses exposed. These vulnerabilities are not necessarily new, but the exposure to them is increasingly being made available to attackers. For instance, a weak patch management process comes with the risk that systems may take longer to patch (or not be patched at all!) resulting in a much larger target window of opportunity for attackers. As we assess the potential impact, it is also important to remember that protecting against an attack is only half the solution – particularly because, as my InfoSec colleagues like to say: “It’s not a matter of IF we get hacked; it’s a matter of WHEN.” A strong cyber resiliency program is a good starting point to address this, but we also need to focus on limiting the impact following an attack by addressing the fundamental structure within the organization – how safe is the system, how compartmentalized are the core areas of technology, and what your ability is to isolate the threat. 8. Need to address communications Finally, to successfully address this risk with a unified front, we must develop an approach to enhanced communications around cyber threats and events, and revisit supervisory guidance in this area. Silence and fear of sharing intelligence in this area could be detrimental to efforts to address the vulnerabilities systematically. We know that breaches have occurred and will continue to occur until the industry is better equipped to be ahead of the attackers, not playing catch up. Right now we are interested in learning from these breaches and using intelligence garnered to get ahead of game. There is a lot to think about here. With all this in mind, I will end this part of my remarks with a reminder of what we see as the key components of any solution designed to address cybersecurity. It must: • Be comprehensive, risk-based and threat-informed; • Be a joint effort between public and private sectors; • Be flexible enough to evolve as technology advances; – Automated – Scalable • Support information sharing; • Leverage best practices; 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  • Include all in the industry – regardless of size or processes (internal systems or external providers); and • Delve deeper than one step below the surface. Conclusion We live in an ever-changing environment where speed and agility are of the essence. Demands from customers change, expectations from shareholders fluctuate and the regulatory landscape you work within will continue to evolve to keep pace. Constant change – and commitment to evolution – is not a choice. It is the only way to survive, stay competitive and stay safe in a complex and vulnerable world. As it relates to cybersecurity, I believe we are at a pivotal moment: we know there is an issue; we will work with you on fully understanding the scope and breadth of the risk; we will be pragmatic and add value; we are looking at this holistically; and our goal is to come out with a set of next steps that will benefit all of us, including protecting the financial system and the U.S. economy as a whole. We need to address cybersecurity before we see a catastrophic event, not analyze it afterwards. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Sustaining the economy’s growth saga through the 3Ps of policymaking – proactive, pre-emptive, and prudent Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the Euromoney Philippines Investment Forum, Manila, 24 March 2015. *      *      * I see from the conference agenda that you have already covered critical topics this morning. Our place in the ASEAN Economic Community, our prospects in the mass market and our infrastructure are certainly key issues for the Philippines today. Before you take on capital market issues and the rest of the forum topics, I thought it would help in the discussion of these sectoral issues, if I would spend the time allotted to me to speak on the broader economy that we operate in. In particular, I would like to speak briefly on the risks to the macroeconomy that the BSP sees in the horizon, and how we, from a monetary and banking policy framework, intend to address these. First, the risks: The risks we face come mainly from the external side. Here I mean the interplay of three key factors: (1) the uneven global economic growth; (2) the uncertainty of the oil price path and the ambiguity of the underlying drivers of the oil price decline; and (3) the resulting divergence in monetary policy stance among major advanced economies. In the last year and a half, these factors have manifested themselves in the movement of global capital into US assets (away from core Europe and emerging markets), an appreciating trend in the US dollar and a decline in global long-term interest rates. The rebalancing in global portfolios, as funds search for better yields, has surfaced in our domestic financial markets as volatility in the peso/dollar exchange rate, and in the local bond and equity markets. Going forward, should the uneven global growth scenario persist, we may see this translate into more pronounced changes in trade patterns. Monetary policy thrusts: In response, the BSP has opted to use a mix of monetary policy tools over the last year. These actions included increases in reserve requirements on bank deposits, upward adjustments in policy interest rates, a strategic presence in the FX market, alongside a clear communication plan, and other macroprudential measures. The BSP did these to allow it to: 1) better manage credit and liquidity growth, 2) anchor inflation expectations, and 3) ward off any potential build up of excesses in some segments of the market that may be overly-reliant on the historically low interest rates for their growth and exuberance. The BSP will continue this strategy of using what it deems as appropriate from the whole range of tools available in its enhanced tool kit. I believe the domestic markets have come to understand this. They now appreciate that the BSP’s approach to responding to challenges is really to be Pro-active, Pre-emptive and Prudent. Three P’s. Banking reforms: Given the central role of banks in the transmission of monetary policy, the BSP is also strategic in ensuring the resiliency of the banking system. We have repeatedly said that our handling of the banking system is premised on striking a balance between the needed prudential limits and the ability of banks to make sound 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  business decisions based on the idiosyncrasies of their operations and the realities of their market. In practice, this translates into specific actions under two facets. 1) Regulatory framework, and 2) Access to financial products. The first facet is crafting a regulatory environment that encourages innovation while adequately mitigating unwarranted financial risks. I want to be clear though that it is not just about Basel 3, although we consider Basel 3 as a primary safety net. There was much apprehension surrounding our adoption of the capital requirements under Basel 3. In fact, I note that one of the topics for discussion in the session following my talk is whether the capital regulatory reforms are affecting banks’ ability to lend. Not to preempt the later discussion, let me just share that, the initial fear over the implementation of the Basel 3 framework is unfounded. Today, our universal and commercial banks continue to have capital levels that can withstand credit stress tests of 20 to 50 percent write-offs. In addition, credit continues to grow at healthy levels. Equally worth noting is that the quality of loans has been improving, with NPLs continuing to fall. It will be interesting to find out the perspectives of the Conference on this issue. I won’t attempt to list all the regulatory reforms, but just to illustrate, let me cite a couple. We have amended the credit risk framework for banks to align this with the global best practice of highlighting the factors that go into a sound credit decision, without relying only on the collaterals pledged against the credit. We have also streamlined the minimum capital requirement for banks so that it is tiered with the extent of their branch network. At the same time, liberalization of bank branching was undertaken so that banks can better make the business decision of how and where they wish to serve their target constituents. To round this out, we have likewise pursued the longstanding objective of developing our capital markets. Recent amendments to our regulations address gaps, particularly in arriving at market rates for purposes of marking-to-market. These new interest rate benchmarking regulations should make pricing of bonds for capital build-up more transparent. All of these are done with the objective of making the regulatory environment more open to the business decisions of service and product providers. They broaden what can be achieved within the banking industry without unduly compromising the regulatory oversight for risks and conflicts of interest. This dovetails with the second facet of how we strike the balance between prudential limits and banks’ decision-making ability. This is – liberalized access to the banking market. It is critical that our market is “financially inclusive” given the structure of the Philippine archipelago. This means that access, products and policy have to generate the desired synergies so that we can equally respond to the needs of those traditionally underserved or underbanked. This is a key advocacy of the BSP, for which we could easily devote another forum. Even if I limit myself today to the traditional banking market, so much has already happened of late. With the enactment of Republic Act 10641, we have increased the ownership ceiling of foreign banks to 100 percent from 60 percent, liberalized branching requirements and allowed foreign banks to participate in foreclosure proceedings of real estate properties. With capital infusion and market presence, the expectation is that the Law would bolster the local banking industry through greater competition, and the benefits from the transfer of skills and technology. This liberalization of the entry of foreign financial institutions positions us well for the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework. But more than just ABIF, we have pursued and supported these legislative initiatives because a competitive globally-oriented banking industry is an essential portal for foreign investments. This, in turn, feeds off the investment grade rating we have obtained from international credit rating agencies. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  While liberalization has its advantages, we recognize that there may be potential issues such as the relaxation of credit standards in the pursuit of larger market share, the risk of contagion and volatile capital flows. Financial stability lens: Ladies and gentlemen, when the BSP considers the effects of potential risks, we do not merely look at the impact on individual firms. Rather, through the lens of financial stability, our concern becomes the bigger picture, examining the interaction among institutions, transactions, products and markets. It is through this new prudential norm that we address the contagion of risks, including those that may potentially arise from any liberalization initiative. Outlook: Against this monetary and banking sector policy backdrop and in light of the risks we anticipate, how do we see the operating environment going forward? Very broadly, we see the country continuing to grow in a stable inflationary environment. We believe liquidity is sufficiently calibrated and that it would support broad-based growth without fuelling inflation which we monitor particularly in view of policy normalization in the US. More specifically, the government’s target of 7–8 percent is attainable as domestic demand conditions remain firm and supported by improving production efficiency and robust labor market dynamics. Meantime, inflation expectations will remain well-anchored. Latest inflation forecasts, based on surveys by the BSP and the Consensus Economics, remain close to the mid-point of the target band of 2–4 percent for 2015–2016. On the banking side, we see that this will remain a reliable intermediator of funds. Given the reform agenda, the system will continue to be characterized by solid asset growth, improved quality of loans and assets, strong capitalization, and better risk management practices. We see the external current account remaining in surplus as exchange inflows from overseas Filipinos (OFs) remittances, business process outsourcing (BPO) revenues, as well as tourism receipts are seen to continue to grow. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, given the positive alignment between inflation and growth, and augmented government resources as a result of fiscal consolidation, both the monetary and financial sectors have sufficient room to make policy adjustments, as may be warranted. Conclusion: You may ask, will the Philippine economy be able to sustain its successive years of strong growth performance over the medium term? I believe so. Apart from the country’s strong fundamentals, the government’s commitment toward sustaining its structural reform agenda would lend critical support to achieving our growth potential. The BSP shares the same commitment. After all, we follow the framework of the Three P’s. I am confident that we will be able to attain our goal of an upward economic growth trajectory, in an environment of price and financial stability because we will remain Proactive in policy dialogue with stakeholders such as yourselves. Pre-emptive in putting in place forward looking policies, and Prudent in adopting reforms. Ladies and gentlemen, even as the outlook remains favorable, now is not the time for complacency. As the genius behind Intel, Andy Grove, once said, “Only the paranoid survive.” I wish therefore that your conference would be peppered with just the right amount of paranoia and balanced with enough openness for finding suitable solutions. Good afternoon and thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Barry Whiteside: Promoting money managerial skills in Fiji Address by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the “be Money Wi$e” Essay Competition Awards Ceremony, Suva, 20 March 2015. *      *      * Distinguished Guests Colleagues Ladies and Gentlemen and most importantly our essay winners – Sakshi Prayatna (Lautoka Andhra Sangam College), Divneeta Devi (Tavua College) and Upasna Chand (Ahmadiyya Muslim College), who are present here today along with their proud school principals and parents. Introductory comments A very warm welcome to you all. I am delighted to be present here with you all, to award and recognise the efforts of our winning students for this important initiative – the “be Money Wi$e” (bMW) Essay competition. I am also grateful for the support of the school principals, teachers and parents of these students. Congratulations to our winners Firstly, congratulations to our three winners who have travelled all the way from Lautoka and Tavua and from nearby Nasinu with their teachers and parents. You have come out on top of 224 other students who are your peers and I know that this must be a proud moment for you. Background This essay competition was launched last December, as one of the activities under the “be Money Wi$e” (bMW) Program, with the theme “be money wise – securing your future goals today”. The bMW program is part of the Capital Markets Awareness platform, targeting school students. Its objective is to promote the importance of acquiring good money management skills with a particular focus on understanding the concept of investing and investment products available in Fiji. The Program has been designed to teach our children “money smart” principles by using creative fun-filled activities which we envision that, in time, will lead to the development of a culture of financial prudence in our children, preparing them well for their adult working life. From the essays that were submitted, it was good to note that many students appreciate the importance of saving towards future goals. It was also great to note that students are now able to identify with the capital markets, (an area still viewed as highly technical by many). I am confident that activities like this competition will help create a culture of learning and information sharing amongst our students, teachers, parents and will help enlighten the nation as a whole on the products and services available in our very own Capital Markets. Building on the success of this activity, we in the Reserve Bank and on our National Capital Markets Taskforce, will continue to commit ourselves to promoting Fiji’s capital markets with the relevant stakeholders and more such activities will be organised for the schools and students in near future. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Acknowledgements Organising activities of such magnitude requires a concerted effort by many stakeholders. So please allow me to thank our sponsors: the South Pacific Stock Exchange; V B Holdings Limited; Fijian Holdings Unit Trust; and the Unit Trust of Fiji, who made this initiative a success. Special thanks also to the Ministry of Education, especially the Acting Permanent Secretary, for supporting our “be Money Wi$e” Program and also for assisting us in relaying the awareness to all schools in a timely manner. We will continue to work closely with Ministry of Education and hope to receive the same support for other activities which will be organised as part of the “be Money Wi$e” Program. Special appreciation must also go out to the members of the Capital Markets Awareness Working Group for helping assess the essays and choosing the winners. Your commitment to the BMW Program is greatly appreciated With all your support and hard work we received a total of 224 entries from secondary schools around Fiji. I might mention that it was certainly not an easy feat to decide on the winners, which was proof of the high calibre of the entries Concluding remarks In concluding, I would again like to congratulate the three winners, Sakshi, Divneeta and Upasna. With your research towards this essay we hope that you have learnt and now have a better feeling of what the capital markets are all about. We also trust that with this knowledge you will be great ambassadors on the subject in your schools and communities. We hope that your prizes will lay a foundation for your future investments and you would, over time, grow to be more savvy investors in Fiji’s Capital Markets. With this, ladies and gentlemen I thank you for your presence here today, thanks also to our winners and all their fellow participating students and I wish you all a great afternoon. VINAKA 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  R Gandhi: Corporate debt market: what needs to be done – a reaffirmation Inaugural address by Mr R Gandhi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the “CARE Ratings Debt Market Summit – 2015”, Mumbai, 23 March 2015. *      *      * Assistance provided by Ms Anupam Sonal is gratefully acknowledged. Good morning ladies and gentlemen! 2. I would like to thank CARE Ratings for taking this initiative of holding this Summit on the corporate debt market. As I can see, the seminar is quite exhaustive in content and we will be having some excellent speakers representing various segments of the industry and hence it will be very interesting to hear their views. As a regulator, we in the Reserve Bank do have our own approach to the development of any market, but to hear the market participants is always important for us as it is only when we debate the issues that we can come to a workable solution. I am sure that we will have a lot to pick up from these deliberations that take place here today. Corporate Bond Market in India – Current status 3. Indian Corporate Debt market has seen some growth in recent years, both in terms of number of issues and amount. The outstanding issues which were at 12,155 as at end March 2011 increased to 18,664 by end Dec 2014. During the same period, the amount outstanding increased from ₹ 8,895 billion to ₹ 16,485 billion. While the types issued included fixed rate bonds, floating rate bonds, structured notes and other types, the fixed rate bonds were predominant both in number and value. Another characteristic of the issuances was that almost all issuances were by financial sector entities. Yet another peculiar feature of our Corporate Bond market is that private placements are the norm. The public issuances which were ₹ 94.51 billion in 2010–11 increased to ₹ 423.83 billion in 2013–14, though it fell back to ₹ 90.49 billion in the current year till Feb 2015. The private placements were ₹ 2187.85 billion in 2010–11, ₹ 2612.82 billion in 2011–12, ₹ 3614.62 billion in 2012–13, ₹ 2760.54 billion in 2013–14 and ₹ 2692.45 billion in the current year till Dec 2014. The secondary market trading was ₹ 6053 billion in 2010–11, ₹ 5938 billion in 2011–12, ₹ 7386 billion in 2012–13, ₹ 9708 billion in 2013–14 and ₹ 10043 billion in the current year till Feb 2015. 4. Though the above mentioned figures do indicate a healthy growth in number and volume of corporate bond market activity, in comparison with government bonds market, the corporate bond market is dwarfed. A comparative position of the governments bonds and corporate bonds as on March 2013 as a proportion of GDP among the major Asian countries in the Table (page 2), reflects India at a very low position vis a vis some of the major Asian countries. Indian Corporate Debt Market – An Enigma 5. Thus corporate debt market in India has been quite an enigma. We keep talking of the issues that are in the way of its progress and the solutions that could address them. Yet, there has been limited movement in this area despite several attempts and there is some kind of gravity keeping us down. We had the R H Patil Committee Report on corporate bonds and securitization of 2005 which has served as a reference point for all of us. However, the progress in the growth of the corporate debt segment has not been too satisfactory and there is evidently a pressing requirement to revisit this subject. There have been several suggestions made – some have been implemented with mixed success. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  6. Yet, as noted earlier, the debt market remains confined largely to financial institutions, and corporates are not much in the picture. Even within this limited perimeter, public issues are less frequent and the preference has been for private placement of debt paper. This is the starting point of the puzzle which we need to analyze. 7. Another part of the puzzle relates to our own achievement. We did experience close to double digit GDP growth in FY08 and our investment ratio was 38.1% in that year- with financing issues not coming in the way. On the face of it one may tend to conclude erroneously that there is no need to get too worried about the absence of development in corporate debt market. After all, have we not got investment rate of 38.1%? The reason why the problem does not appear to be magnified is because we are working at well below our potential. We are not realizing that the paucity in long term resources can severely come in the way of investment. Therefore, the question to be asked is as to for how long can we carry on with this situation. 8. We do have fairly large numbers that are required for financing both industrial growth of 8–10% in the next five years and funds required for infrastructure development. Presently as industrial growth is in the phase of stagnation and infrastructure well below satisfactory levels due to a varied set of factors around policy action, the demand for funds has not really reached the expected levels. Evidently this should not give rise to complacency and we should work in this period in building structures for growing our corporate debt market. Need to develop the Corporate Debt Market 9. The government has its own limitations when chipping in as the fiscal responsibility targets leave little scope for finding funds. Though the commercial banks do cater to the 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  investment needs of corporate and infrastructure sectors, they are also reaching their own limitations. We have gotten support from FDI and external borrowings, but they have their own pace and size. External borrowings are a good way out when global interest rates are low. But, the repercussions on our external debt are significant, and while we have been permitting ECBs into various sectors, the external debt levels have been rising which has servicing implications. Intuitively we can see that the capital market has to become progressively more relevant in this process of garnering long term funds. 10. Economists contend that the absence of an adequately sized corporate debt market leads to an oversized banking system in any economy. It also results in a large portion of the lending market being excessively regulated, without being subjected to free market forces. Such an imbalance is not desirable, because this becomes the perfect breeding ground for crony capitalism, sloppy lending by banks and careless investments by corporates. Financing of resources through corporate bonds rather than bank finance instills a greater sense of credit discipline among the borrowers as the default events are captured immediately and placed in the public domain. The disclosure requirements act as a big disincentive for default or delayed payment. It has been observed that borrowers take the regulatory norm of 90 days period for a default to be recognised as a Non-Performing Asset as a leeway for withholding the payment till the 89th day from the due date. On the other hand, even a single day default by an issuer of corporate bond will be recognised as default in the market and the information of default will be publicly available. Further, such information / risk will also be reflected in external credit ratings and traded credit derivatives on a real time basis. Pricing of credit also gets diluted in bank financing as credit facilities are extended not only on the basis of credit worthiness of the borrower but also the relationship between the banks and their borrowers. Financing through corporate bonds might remove such distortions to a large extent as investors will demand higher coupon for issues with lower credit worthiness, while borrowers with strong fundamentals and sound business get rewarded by lower cost of financing. Thus there are many advantages of an efficient, well developed and liquid corporate debt market. 11. The importance of a developed debt market viz., the corporate debt market for a country like India, which has an huge and ever growing capital funding requirement is widely acknowledged and although various measures on the regulatory and policy front have been introduced in recent times, concerted efforts from all market participants is required to develop and grow the largely untapped potential of the country’s corporate debt markets. Expert Committees 12. In India, progressively, a number of Committees and Groups were set up by RBI to study the bank financing / funding patterns vis a vis the corporate funding requirements. Prominent among them were the Tandon Committee, Chore Committee, etc. The committees uniformly recommended that corporate reliance on bank finance for short term recurring expenses need to be brought down. Chore Committee specifically recommended the need for reducing the over-dependence of the medium and large borrowers – both in the public and private sectors on bank finance. 13. More recently, a High Level Expert Committee on Corporate Bonds was set up under the chairmanship of Shri R. H Patil which submitted its report in December 2005 and made several recommendations including the need for rationalisation of stamp duty structure and issuance costs, tax deducted at source, encouraging securitization, repos and CDS in corporate bonds, enhancing issuer and investor base, simplifying issuance procedures, etc. 14. In the year 2009, the Committee for Financial Sector Reforms (CFSR) (Chairman: Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan) also looked into the issues inhibiting the corporate debt market and made several recommendations on similar lines. Some of the highlights were to bring all trading related regulation within the purview of SEBI, improve coordination between various concerned agencies where multiple regulators share concern, set up a working group on 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  financial sector reforms with Finance Minister as Chairman, the Committee, had recommended the sequencing approach for corporate finance, which entails developing a number of missing markets as well as complementary development of other sectors in the economy for a healthy development of the corporate bond market. Current issues 15. There are some key issues that the corporate debt market faces. They need be tackled to facilitate improvement and growth of this segment. Foremost among these are as follows: a) The abysmal liquidity and the consequent lack of depth in the corporate debt markets. The absence of a liquid corporate bond market acts as a deterrent to investor participation. Trading in Indian bond markets are characterized by trading in certain maturities and tendency of investors to ‘buy and hold’ instruments, both of which inhibit liquidity. Here the role of institutional investors such as pension funds, provident funds and insurance companies must be reassessed. They do need to take some more initiative and be aggressive in actively managing their portfolios. Their investment horizon should not be confined to AA and above only. This will add a lot of buoyancy to the market. b) Low investor base – The investor base in the corporate debt market is confined to banks, insurance companies, PFs, pension funds and primary dealers. Retail participation remains low due to absence of knowledge and understanding of bonds as an asset class. It is imperative to consider innovative ways for expanding the investor base. The fund management industry can contribute significantly in attracting the retail investor to corporate debt. c) Preference of public debt – The huge supply of government papers in the country is one of the major impediments to growth of the corporate bond markets. Government borrowing and thereby the supply of government papers are seen to grow unabated year on year. We have seen that the government is progressively trying to rein in the deficit at the absolute level which will put less pressure on the market. Also the move of the Reserve Bank to gradually lower the SLR which can also be positive for the corporate bond market. d) Limited instruments and products – There is need for a wide array of instruments and products to be available in the markets that would meet the diverse needs of its participants. There is lack of these in the Indian context which in turn inhibits development of these markets. CDS and IRFs have been some of the instrument that have come in of late and it is expected that these will grow. Of late, there has been some element of buoyancy in the IRF market which is a good sign. Securitization of the corporate debt instruments would provide a big fillip to the market as it would improve risk transference and diversification and provide liquidity to the issuers. e) Market Infrastructure also finds mention as a factor affecting corporate bond market trading and thereby transparency and vibrancy in the market. Infrastructure facilities such as screen based automated order matching, central clearing and settlement, negotiated dealing system, etc. on the lines available to the government securities market would certainly facilitate and encourage secondary market trading, enhance market transparency and liquidity as well as develop scientific risk pricing. We need to improve the credit rating mechanism for corporate bonds and encourage market for lower grade ratings which inhibits the market. f) Ease of issuances – Bond issuance is viewed as being costly and cumbersome compared with bank lending. For it to be attractive to the issuers to approach the corporate debt market, the ease and cost of issuance has to improve. The listing 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  and disclosure requirements and procedures have to be simple and less complicated. The size, scale and tenure of issues must improve and need to be made more attractive by encouraging public offers instead of the current preference for private placements. It is expected that consolidation of bond issues through reissuance/s would improve liquidity and encourage secondary market transactions. However, care would need to be taken to prevent excessive batching of redemptions and consequent liquidity stress. g) Market making – The growth and development of any market is dependent on market makers who can provide both buy and sell quotes. Although prevalent in the government securities markets, they are lacking in the corporate bond segment. Market makers not only assume risk, they add diversity to the markets. Therefore, we need to develop a class of underwriters and market makers in corporate debt bonds on the lines of Primary Dealers in the government securities market. Policy Initiatives 16. What are we doing to tackle these issues affecting the corporate bond market? Several measures are being undertaken at the policy level to address these. Some of the recent initiatives by Government, the Reserve Bank, SEBI and other agencies in the direction of developing the corporate debt market are as follows: a) Trade reporting platform: For improving transparency, reporting platforms for OTC trades in corporate bonds, Commercial Paper, Certificates of Deposits, Non-Convertible Debentures and securitized debt has been set up. Till recently, reporting of trades in corporate bonds was done at three different places (FIMMDA’s FTRAC, reporting platform of NSE and BSE). Though multiple reporting platforms were available, majority of trades were reported on FIMMDA platform and cleared through one of the clearing houses of the stock exchanges. The reporting of secondary market trades in corporate bonds and securitised debt by RBI regulated entities has been shifted to stock exchanges with effect from April 1, 2014. b) Pooling account: Clearing houses of the stock exchanges have been permitted to have a pooling fund account with RBI to facilitate DvP-I based settlement of trades in corporate bonds. c) Repo in corporate bond: In 2010, repos in corporate bonds were permitted to regulated and other RBI permitted entities. Guidelines were further relaxed in terms of reduction of minimum haircut requirements and expanding the list of eligible collateral by permitting short term instruments like CP, CD and NCDs of original maturity less than 1 year. Scheduled Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) have also been permitted to participate in the repo market subject to adherence to conditions prescribed. d) Credit Default Swaps (CDS) on corporate bonds: CDS on corporate bonds has been permitted to facilitate hedging of credit risk associated with holding corporate bonds. Based on market feedback, short term instruments like CP, CD & NCDs and unlisted but rated corporate bonds have also been permitted as eligible reference obligations. e) Encouraging participation of banks and PDs in corporate bonds: i. In July 2014, banks have been permitted to issue long-term bonds with a minimum maturity of seven years to raise resources for lending to (a) long term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors, and (b) affordable housing. These bonds have been exempted from computation of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as well as Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) and are therefore not been subjected to CRR / SLR or priority sector lending requirements. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  ii. The Reserve Bank has issued the instructions asking banks to consider raising Tier II capital through public issuance to retail investors. iii. In order to encourage active participation of standalone PDs in corporate debt, investment norms have been relaxed by allowing them to invest funds borrowed from call money market subject to certain limits, enhancing investment limit in Tier II bonds of other PDs / banks / FIs from 5% to 10% of NOF and increasing the Inter Corporate Deposit (ICD) borrowing limit from 75% to 150% of NOF. iv. Banks and standalone PDs have been allowed to become direct members of stock exchanges for undertaking proprietary trades in corporate bonds. v. Credit enhancement by banks – As per a recent policy announcement made, it is proposed to permit banks to offer partial credit enhancement to corporate bonds by way of providing funded and un-funded credit facilities for infrastructure projects but not by way of guarantee. The final instructions are expected to be issued shortly. f) Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs): i. Rationalisation of investment limits: FPI investment limits have been rationalised, whereby existing limits and subdivisions have been merged in two broad categories – government securities and corporate bonds. The sub-limits for FPIs in Government securities ($10 billion) and dated securities ($15 billion) and other categories have been merged to retain the overall cap of $25 billion. In case of corporate bonds, the ceiling of $1 billion for qualified foreign investors (QFIs), $25 billion for FPIs and $25 billion for FPIs in long-term infra bonds, have been merged – retaining the overall cap for corporate bonds at $51 billion. ii. Rationalization of allocation of debt limits: Method for allocation of debt limits in corporate bond market through auction has been changed. As per revised scheme, FIIs can now invest in Corporate Debt without purchasing debt limits till the overall investment reaches 90% after which the auction mechanism would be initiated for allocation of the remaining limits. Consequent to the changes, the restrictions on re-investment by FPIs, shall no longer apply in respect of limits held / investments made by FIIs in the Corporate Debt category, till the limits are available on tap. iii. Withholding tax rate: The rate of withholding tax on interest payments on the borrowings of Infrastructure Debt Funds (IDF), investments made by a non-resident in rupee denominated long-term infrastructure bonds and interest on FIIs’ investment made in bonds issued by Indian companies and Government securities have been reduced from 20 per cent to 5 per cent. iv. New Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Regulations: Recently, SEBI has notified new FPI regulations to put in place an easier registration process and operating framework for overseas entities seeking to invest in Indian capital markets. The new regulations replace the existing SEBI regulations for FIIs and the new class of investors, FPIs, would encompass all FIIs, their sub-accounts and QFIs. v. The Budget for 2015–16 has proposed to extend the period of applicability of reduced rate of tax at 5% in respect of income of foreign investors (FIIs and QFIs) from corporate bonds and government securities, from 31.5.2015 to 30.06.2017. g) Credit enhancement by IIFCL: It has been mentioned in the Union Budget 2013–14 that IIFCL will provide partial credit guarantee to enhance ratings of bond issues, enabling 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  channelization of long-term funds for infrastructure projects. IIFCL is presently undertaking pilot transactions under its Credit Enhancement initiative. h) Introduction of Rupee linked offshore bonds by International Finance Corporation (IFC): With an objective to signal confidence in the Indian economy and encourage inflows of USD in India, IFC was permitted to float a rupee linked bond overseas for an amount of USD 1 billion. IFC received very good response and the limit has been fully utilized by IFC. i) Domestic Issuance of bonds by IFC: Approval has also been given to IFC to issue bonds in India worth ₹ 15000 crore for infrastructure financing. This will also facilitate development of benchmark yield for long term corporate bonds. Way forward 17. Going forward, we expect a special impetus to the growth of corporate debt market in our guidance to the banks to issue long term bonds to support infrastructure and housing projects. Further, in order to meet the capital requirements under the Basel III Framework, banks will tap the market with their Additional Tier 1 bonds, besides Tier 2 bonds. These developments can usher in emergence of quasi government yield curve, which can serve as benchmark for corporate issuances. When the Basel 3 Framework relating to Large Exposure norms take effect, and as banks reach their limits in supporting direct lending to the corporate sector, corporates be nudged to resort to market borrowing. On top of this, the expected robust economic growth will also compel the corporate sector to approach the market. Keeping all these in perspective, we need to ready ourselves with the following measures to usher in a vibrant corporate debt market: a) regulatory and administrative reforms to institutionalize debt markets, b) involvement of market-makers who can provide two-way bid-ask quotes, c) enhancement of investor base, d) increasing the efficiency of these markets through better reporting, settlement and clearing platforms, e) emphasis on the reduction of information asymmetry. Conclusion 18. To conclude, the debt markets is undoubtedly a very essential segment of the country’s financial markets and vibrancy in these markets is imperative to meeting the massive funding requirements of the country. I am confident that this Conference proceedings and discussions will lead to specific suggestions for action and provide clarity on issues. 19. I thank you all of you for your time and attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  S S Mundra: Defeating poverty – issues and challenges Keynote address by Mr S S Mundra, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 39th Skoch Summit, New Delhi, 20 March 2015. *      *      * 1. Mr. Sameer Kochhar, Chairman, Skoch Group; other dignitaries on the dais and in the audience; delegates to the Summit; members of the print and electronic media; ladies and gentlemen! It is a pleasure and privilege for me to be present here today at the inaugural session of the 39th Skoch Summit on the theme of “Defeating Poverty”. The theme of this conference is extremely relevant at the current juncture when the groundwork on linking each household to the banking sector in a mission mode under the PMJDY is nearing completion. I congratulate Skoch for choosing this particular theme for its Summit. 2. The ILO Declaration of Philadelphia, 1944 states “Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere.” Poverty, therefore, has implications for global stability which has been well appreciated by the policy makers the world over. As across the globe, policy makers in India i.e. GOI and the financial sector regulators, particularly RBI have also endeavored to ensure that poverty is tackled in all its forms and that the benefits of economic growth reaches the poor and excluded groups in the society.  3. Franklin D. Roosevelt said “the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.” If we were to apply this yardstick for measuring our progress, we would be considered to have failed miserably. Even after nearly sixty eight years since achieving our independence, poverty remains one of India’s largest and most pressing problems. There is no gainsaying that a nation cannot become great when the lives of millions of its citizens are benighted by poor nutrition, limited by poor learning opportunities and shriveled by gender discrimination. What is poverty?  4. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines poverty as “the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions.” However, poverty is not simply characterized by a lack of adequate income. It has far reaching implications. People who suffer from poverty experience a number of deprivations and restrictions. Its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion, as well as the lack of participation in decision-making and in civil, social and cultural life. One important thing to note is that poverty cannot be defeated through charity. Empowering people with a means to sustaining themselves in the long term is the solution that can defeat poverty. 5. Unemployment is at the center of poverty. For the poor, labour is often the only asset that can be used to improve the lives and wellbeing. It is crucial that we empower the poor who have the potential but often lack opportunities to shape their lives. Bidirectional cause-effect relationship between financial exclusion and poverty 6. As I said earlier, poverty is generally associated with a low level of income. This income is primarily directed towards consumption thereby leaving very little for saving/investment. A low level of savings obviates the need for a banking account thereby creating financial exclusion and lack of investment opportunities. This creates a barrier for financial inclusion from the demand perspective. Conversely, financial exclusion can deprive people of the benefits and the incentives offered by the financial system. Poverty can, therefore, be self-fuelling from generations to generations. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  How to break this vicious circle? 7. I am not an economist. Many eminent speakers would dwell on this issue during the day. However, I wish to put forward some perspectives as I see them. Let me begin with measurement of poverty. I am not on whether those spending below Rs. 32 in rural areas or below Rs. 47 in urban areas (as defined by the Rangarajan committee) or Rs. 27 and Rs. 33 respectively as fixed by Tendulkar Panel earlier, are to be considered poor. My question is whether such income levels across countries or states (even after adjusting for purchasing power parity) are comparable without taking into account the availability, quality and cost of such basic amenities as health care, education, transport, sanitation etc. Would not a composite index (if one can be devised) of these two elements would be a truer indicator of real poverty level? This can be elaborated with several measurable examples but time limit does not permit to do so.  8. Extending that argument further, would it mean that there could be two ways to address the challenge of defeating poverty? a. State ensures availability of quality amenities I mentioned earlier to all needy citizens – question is, whether it is feasible? b. Empower and facilitate all citizens to earn such levels of income that they can buy these services from the open market. Issue to contemplate is whether this can be done in a short term or even in the medium term.  9. Then would it be fair to assume that a combination of above two would be a more realistic goal to pursue for quite some time to come considering the dimension of the work involved? Would it also be fair to assume that pursuing only one of the above or even both but with varying emphasis would not serve the purpose? 10. Leaving this broader issue for wider discussion, let me now turn to the various initiatives taken in past few years in respect of poverty alleviation /financial inclusion /employment generation etc. Priority Sector Lending 11. Efforts are also underway to reorient the priority sector lending guidelines to serve today’s growth and inclusion agenda. An Internal Working Group at RBI has revisited the existing guidelines and suggested revisions for ensuring channeling credit to segments that get crowded out in the absence of specific targets. These include small and marginal farmers, micro enterprises and the weaker sections while broadening the scope to include other underserved categories of national priority, such as agriculture infrastructure, social infrastructure, renewable energy, exports and medium sized enterprises. Financial Inclusion Plan 12. Let me briefly highlight what RBI has been doing for mainstreaming the marginalized sections of the society and for ensuring an equitable growth in the country. RBI has been relentless in its pursuit of achieving universal financial inclusion by following a structured and planned approach. As I mentioned earlier, the focus is not only on ensuring access to financial services and products but also taking efforts to address issues emanating from the demand side through Financial Literacy initiatives. Phase II of the Financial Inclusion Plan is currently under operation which seeks to connect all the 600,000 plus villages in the country to banks either through a brick and mortar branch or a BC agent by the end of the year.  PMJDY 13. To say that Government’s PMJDY scheme has been a success would be a massive understatement. One must admire the vision and intent behind the program. Lot of efforts 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  has gone into opening the bank accounts and most households have been connected to the formal financial system. The need of the hour now is to ensure that services are easily accessible to the account holders, are cost-effective and service efficient & most importantly the accounts remain active. For the account to remain active, the holders would need income and benefits to flow into them. Focus should also be placed on inculcating savings habit among the people. Once the saving habits take root, people would look for investments. Only then this massive exercise would be meaningful. Direct benefit transfer 14. In order for the new bank account holders to continue to remain engaged with the formal financial system, Government’s DBT program is expected to play a big role. It would ensure that the benefits are transferred directly to the targeted population and the leakages are avoided. Licensing of payment and small finance banks 15. With the objective of furthering financial inclusion and supply of credit to small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and other unorganized sector entities RBI has decided to license a number of small finance banks. Also, licensing of a few payments banks is envisaged to provide payments/remittance services to migrant labour workforce, low income households, small businesses, other unorganized sector entities and other users. Promoting entrepreneurship and self-employment  16. Preparing the poor people for self-employment is perhaps the most lasting solution for poverty alleviation. The role of entrepreneurship as a key driver of economic growth and development and alleviating poverty and unemployment has been well researched and documented in both developed and developing countries. Entrepreneurship promotes innovation, creates competitive advantage and economic prosperity and helps create wealth and job opportunities thereby improving the standard of living of individuals, their families and communities.  Empowerment through microfinance 17. Microfinance is an influential means of empowerment for the poor and vulnerable and helps in extricating them out of their poverty and misery. It basically works on the premise that it is better to teach someone to fish rather than simply giving them a fish. It gives the poor the necessary tools, skills, and resources to help them engage in productive activities and grow their way out of poverty.  SHG bank linkage model 18. SHG (Self Help Group) bank linkage programme piloted by NABARD in 1992 with 500 SHGs of rural poor has now transformed into the world’s largest microfinance initiative with over 7.4 million SHGs representing 97 million rural households becoming part of the movement. This has been the predominant form of lending to women as 84% of SHGs are women SHGs as on March 31, 2014. The scale of the programme is huge given savings of women SHGs in banks stands at over Rs 80 billion as on March 31, 2014 and bank loan outstanding against women SHGs is over Rs 360 billion as on March 31, 2014. The emphasis of the SHGF program is now to shift towards livelihood opportunities to SHG members apart from the expanding outreach across the country. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Role of MSMEs in poverty alleviation 19. Promoting growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is critical from the perspective of job creation which is recognized as a prime mover of the development agenda in India. MSMEs sector contributes about 45% of the total industrial output, 40% of the export and 8% in the GDP. Also, the sector employs largest amount of workforce after agriculture and promotes balanced regional development. In terms of the recommendations of the Prime Minister’s Task Force on MSMEs, banks are advised to achieve a 20 per cent year-on-year growth in credit to micro and small enterprises and a 10 per cent annual growth in the number of micro enterprise accounts. It is also mandated that 60 per cent of MSE advances should go to the micro enterprises keeping in view large scale exclusion of micro enterprises from the formal banking system.  Focus on skill development 20. Globally, most students after completing their class 12th are considered to be ready for a job as the education system prepares them for a vocation of their choice. In India, however, the lack of employment opportunities after getting the basic education necessarily results in two outcomes – one of disillusionment with the education system and second, keep on pursuing higher education for want of a job.  21. Dearth of formal vocational education, high school dropout rates, inadequate skill training capacity, negative perception towards skilling, lack of industry ready skills even in professional courses, continue to stand out as some of the major causes of poor skill levels and lack of entrepreneurship in India’s workforce. There is a pressing need to scale up the skills of the unorganized workforce within the sector as well as those of the MSME employers through training inputs. Integrating the skill development initiatives with secondary and intermediate level education would address the challenge of low education levels and also provide school dropouts with employability skills.  22. It is heartening to note that the Government is committed to encourage entrepreneurship in the country through a revision of the national skill development policy of 2009 so that schemes of different ministries can be routed through the newly formed skills ministry. This would be vital considering the current Government’s thrust on “Make In India.” Conclusion  23. Before I conclude, let me raise a few concerns which can be detrimental to the consolidation and furtherance of the significant work done in the area of financial inclusion and poverty alleviation in the recent past. • Is too much demand being placed on the banking system resources? The banks are presently almost alone expected to identify & enrol new customers, educate them, conduct Aadhaar registration, carry out administration of linked life/non-insurance schemes & pension products and so on. The issue is whether it would encroach upon their other obligations of credit dispensation, maintaining asset quality, maintaining service standards etc. • Loan waiver schemes or employment not resulting into creation of social infrastructure /productive assets raise risk to broader work culture/credit culture in the country  • Non-adherence to basic economic discipline by the states eg. in fixing the Minimum Support Price can be counterproductive in the long run  • Weakened Governance and multiplicity of regulations in the co-operative sector- Are we doing enough to exploit potential of co-operative sector? • Need we draw lessons from the history of RRBs while pursuing BC model? 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Then there are two larger issues- one each in respect of rural and urban poverty alleviation  • Don’t we need a new model to enhance productivity & stop further fragmentation of already smaller land holding – Are DBT/interest subvention long-term answers to these problems?  • Migration from rural India and rapid urbanization is a reality with social, infrastructural, employment and inclusion dimensions – are we adequately prepared to deal with them?  24. It must thus be appreciated that poverty alleviation is a long drawn process and needs support from all quarters – the Government, other policy makers, the media and the society at large. Each one needs to do his/her bit to ensure that the poverty is defeated so that prosperity thrives. An ecosystem needs to be created which can fight poverty in all its manifestations. I once again thank Mr. Kochhar and SKOCH for inviting me to this Conference and wish the deliberations all success! Thank you.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Regional integration and global integration – is there a conflict? Speech by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum Kuala Lumpur Debate, Kuala Lumpur, 20 March 2015. *      *      * It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the inaugural Kuala Lumpur Debates, which is being held on the side of the 19th ASEAN Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meetings. It is envisaged for this to be the first in a series of KL Debates intended to serve as a strategic forum for policy makers, industry players as well as members of the public to constructively discuss the key issues confronting the economies of our region and thus to facilitate greater understanding as we work towards building stronger foundations for sustainable growth. The motion that is put forward for debate today is “Regional integration and global integration: is there a conflict”. The debate format is chosen to allow both points of view to be heard, thereby ensuring a balanced discussion and evaluation of the issues. This topic is highly relevant to ASEAN as there have been various views on ASEAN integration and what it means for the rest of the world. East Asia in particular has become more integrated than ever before as manifested by the size of intra-regional trade, which now accounts for about half of the region’s total trade in 2014, and the increase in intra-regional investment flows (foreign direct investment for ASEAN-10 for example rose more than 50 percent to 17% in 2013 from 11% in 2003). Regional cooperation such as the harmonisation of rules, liberalisation and deregulation in various economic sectors, enhancing regional safety nets, has also intensified since the Asian financial crisis. The increase in the network of dialogue has also brought the region closer together. These trends have coincided with Asia’s increasing significance, influence and integration in the world economy, with the region contributing to more than half of global growth since 2008. There is hence a growing international interest to better understand the region and the implications of the greater regional integration in Asia within the context of the global economy. I believe we have an eminent and well qualified panel of speakers to provide us their perspectives on this topic. I hope you enjoy listening to their views. I am certainly looking forward to it. On that note, I wish to thank OMFIF for co-hosting this debate with Bank Negara Malaysia. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Glenn Stevens: Remarks to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia (AMCHAM) Remarks by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia (AMCHAM), Melbourne, 20 March 2015. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to join you today. In an audience of business leaders exposed to the American and Australian business scenes, I might be expected to attempt some comparisons of the two economies. So I offer the following snapshot. • In America, growth has improved over the past year, having been much slower than policy makers would have liked for quite a few years, after a very deep recession in 2008–09. Real GDP per head is 2¾ per cent above its previous peak in December 2007. • In Australia the economy is growing, but has been somewhat slower than we would have liked for a while. We haven’t had a deep downturn for more than twenty years. Real GDP per head is about 5½ per cent higher than in December 2007. • In America, the unemployment rate peaked at 10 per cent in October 2009 and is now at 5½ per cent. The average rate in the new century to date (ie since 2000) is 6½ per cent. • In Australia the unemployment rate in October 2009 was about 5½ per cent. It fell, then gradually rose again to be 6¼ per cent now. The average in the new century to date is 5½ per cent. • In America, inflation is low and asset values have been rising. Interest rates are extremely low, but the central bank is talking about raising them. • In Australia, inflation is low and asset values have been rising. Interest rates are very low, and the central bank has talked about lowering them further. • In America, international competitiveness is declining due to the rising US dollar. • In Australia, international competitiveness is improving, due to the declining Australian dollar. • In America, there is political partisanship across a range of issues, and budget stalemate. • In Australia, there is political partisanship across a range of issues and, over the past year, budget stalemate. The result? American businesses and households seem to be getting more optimistic about the future. But Australian businesses and households seem to be getting less optimistic about the future. It would be an interesting lunch conversation to talk about how all those facts lead to the two differing conclusions about the future. Admittedly, the global backdrop in some respects is less supportive to Australia than it had been some years ago. Our terms of trade are falling. They have been doing so for about 3½ years. It had always been understood that this would occur, even if we were not very accurate in predicting its timing (we predicted it way too early) or its extent: some key resource prices initially fell a little more slowly, but more recently a good deal more quickly, than either official or private consensus forecasts had assumed. Nonetheless, the actual 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  event has been getting much attention. The various ramifications – declining mining investment, the effects on incomes and government revenues – are the subject of daily news. In some other respects, not a lot has changed lately. China continues to grow in size and importance and to open up. Much was made of China “missing” its 2014 growth target, by one tenth of a percentage point. (Let us in Australia hope our target misses are all only of that size.) Much was also made of the lower target set for 2015, but this was always going to occur, and successive growth objectives are likely to get progressively lower over the years ahead. An economy as large as China is unlikely to sustain the sorts of growth rates seen in earlier years. No one grows at 10 per cent forever. Even growth a bit below this year’s objective would still be a considerable impetus to global demand and output. That said, the outworking of some of the excesses of the earlier period of rapid growth, especially the period just after the financial crisis of 2008, remains a work in progress and a source of risk. But in other ways, one could argue that the global backdrop has improved. As I have noted, the US economy – still the world’s largest and most innovative – has gained momentum over the past year, looking through the temporary ups and downs of the data. For all China’s great importance to Australia these days, a healthy US economy should not be underestimated as a driver of business thinking and as a trend-setter for financial markets. In addition, the fall in oil prices, which is mostly the result of more oil being available than used to be the case, is mainly a bullish development for the global economy in the short term, problems for producer states notwithstanding. It is a bonus for American consumers certainly. It is expected that the Federal Reserve will, some time this year, lift the federal funds rate accelerator off the floor. If that happens there will no doubt be some disruption, as always, and more so as it will be the first Fed tightening for nine years and the ECB will be easing policy at the same time. So there is likely to be some turbulence in asset and foreign exchange markets. On the whole, though, I think we should regard the Fed’s likely actions as a positive development. Fed policy is still likely to be quite expansionary for some time. The punch bowl isn’t being taken away, its contents are just being made a little less potent. While that is going on our own economy continues its adjustment to the end of the investment phase of the “mining boom”. The massive run-up in resources sector capital spending that was a natural response to earlier very high prices is reversing, causing a drag on demand. So we hope for other sources of demand to speed up to help make up the difference. Some of them are, though not as seamlessly as any of us would like. I’ve talked a lot about this before so I won’t labour the point. It is a major transition. We can hope to assist it, and the Reserve Bank is doing that, and will continue to lend what support it can, within the limits of its powers and consistent with its mandate. The decline in the exchange rate is assisting the transition (as it assisted in absorbing the earlier phase of the mining boom). But we have always said we cannot hope to fine-tune this transition, however much we may wish otherwise. Looking back at the history of such episodes, of which there have been a few over the past century or more, if we come through this terms of trade event with neither a major outbreak of inflation in the upswing nor a major crash in the downswing, even if we have a period of sub-average growth in the process, we will have done far, far better than in any previous event of this kind, let alone one of this magnitude. I still think that is the most likely outcome. Even so, the lower terms of trade mean that, all other things equal, the path of future incomes is not as high as it might have looked a few years ago. Even allowing for the fact that we all knew, intellectually, that at least part of the boom was not permanent, there is a human tendency to project what we see now (good or bad) into the future. Eventually reality intrudes and we have to re-evaluate. That has happened countless times before and will again, no doubt. It means that attention needs to be given to the things that help our economy work to deliver what we need even with a lower terms of trade. These were the sorts of things that made a 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  difference before the mining boom. They are not my field of expertise. I can simply observe that things such as: • open, competitive markets; • education and skill building; • flexibility and adaptability; • quality public infrastructure; • strong public institutions, and pragmatic, balanced regulatory arrangements; and • rewards for entrepreneurial risk-taking are likely to give us the best chance for the kind of prosperity we seek. Public policy will have its own contribution in fostering such an environment, but it is businesses (large and small) and individuals making their own choices that will ultimately deliver whatever success we are capable of.  
   Haruhiko Kuroda: Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing – theory and practice Speech by Mr Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan, Tokyo, 20 March 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. Introduction It is my great honor to have the opportunity to speak today at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan. With the European Central Bank (ECB) having started its asset purchase program, most of the major central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BOE), now have adopted quantitative easing (QE). If I may borrow the words of Professor Takatoshi Ito, a friend and someone I greatly respect, “we are all QE-sians now.” That being said, the economic and price situation against which QE has been introduced, as well as the policy transmission mechanism assumed, differ among countries and regions. Today, I would like to clarify the characteristics of the Bank of Japan’s current quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) by focusing on similarities to and differences with the QE introduced by other central banks. I will further explain how QQE has been producing the intended effects. I. The theory behind QQE Similarities and Differences between QE and QQE I just mentioned that “we are all QE-sians now.” What brought us into this situation is the global financial crisis in 2008. The U.S. and European economies deteriorated considerably due to the global financial crisis and unemployment increased substantially, so that central banks had to stimulate the economy through monetary easing. Initially, central banks in Europe and the United States responded to the crisis by using the traditional policy tool of lowering short-term interest rates, but since the economies deteriorated quite significantly, those rates soon approached the zero lower bound (Chart 1). Facing the zero lower bound on short-term nominal interest rates, central banks were therefore confronted with the question of how to proceed with further monetary easing. The Federal Reserve’s and the BOE’s answer was to introduce QE. QE mainly aims at stimulating the economy by lowering long-term interest rates, which still had room to fall, through massive purchases of government and other bonds by the central bank. The Bank’s QQE is similar to QE in that it aims to encourage long-term interest rates to decline through massive purchases of government bonds. QQE, however, has another element: to drastically change the deflationary mindset that had taken hold amid the prolonged deflation. In order to understand this point, it is necessary to correctly diagnose the problems ailing Japan’s economy and identify appropriate remedies. Japan’s economy had been suffering from deflation since the mid-1990s, with the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) being about zero or slightly negative. A key feature of deflation in Japan was that it was mild but persistent: the average of the year-on-year rates of change in the CPI from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 2012 was only minus 0.3 percent, but the deflationary situation lasted for a decade and a half (Chart 2). Japan got mired in deflation due to a variety of factors, including balance sheet adjustments by firms and financial institutions following the bursting of the asset price bubble, the inflow of low-priced goods from emerging economies, and the excessive appreciation of the yen. BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   Whatever the reasons may be, a key problem that arose is that, as prices continued to fall due to these factors for a prolonged period, a deflationary mindset took hold among the public – that is, the belief became entrenched that prices would not increase but continue to steadily decline. Once this deflationary mindset had taken hold, people engaged in economic activity assuming that deflation would continue. As a result, the economy fell into a vicious cycle of a decline in prices, a decline in sales and profits, stagnant wages and consumption, and a further decline in prices. Moreover, under deflation, the real value of cash and deposits increases with the decline in prices. Therefore, hoarding cash and deposits becomes a relatively better investment strategy than actual investment, discouraging firms from taking risks and investing in business facilities and in research and development to launch new businesses. In this way, deflation in Japan perpetuated itself in a self-fulfilling manner and the growth potential continued to decline. In order to overcome this situation, it is necessary to change the entrenched view that “prices will not rise” and achieve a state in which firms and households act based on the assumption that “prices will rise moderately every year.” In the economic jargon, people’s view on how prices will develop in the future is called inflation expectations. And although inflation rates tend to fluctuate – reflecting not only the business cycle but also temporary factors such as changes in commodity prices – they are likely to do so at around the level of inflation expectations on average, if medium- to long-term inflation expectations are anchored at a certain level. A numerical definition of what central banks consider as price stability based on a specific price index is about 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI; this has become the global standard in recent years. While I will not go into detail due to time constraints, this figure – 2 percent – takes into account the upward bias in the CPI, that is, the tendency of the index to overstate inflation, and provides a buffer allowing to sufficiently lower real interest rates should the economy deteriorate. For Japan’s economy to overcome deflation, it was necessary to dispel the deflationary mindset and raise inflation expectations – which had declined to about 0 percent – to about 2 percent and re-anchor expectations at that level. Changing people’s expectations is the main aim of QQE. The theory behind QQE Attempting to change people’s mindset and perceptions through monetary policy is not without historical precedent. For example, while the direction of desired change was the opposite of that in Japan, the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker was successful in the late 1970s to early 1980s in substantially lowering inflation expectations, which had been ratcheting upward, through powerful monetary tightening (Chart 3). Since both unemployment and inflation were surging at the time, such stringent monetary tightening created both political and social challenges. Despite such difficulties, however, it was quite clear to Chairman Volcker what policy steps he had to take to lower inflation expectations: he had to pursue strong monetary tightening by substantially raising short-term interest rates to contain inflation. On the other hand, while QQE would not aggravate unemployment, it faced another problem, namely that the tools for monetary easing were limited, given that short-term interest rates were close to the zero lower bound. The thinking behind QQE is as follows. First of all, as I discussed earlier, given that short-term interest rates had declined to zero, the Bank, like the Federal Reserve and the BOE, decided to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates through massive purchases of government bonds. The Bank then focused on the fact that what influences economic activity is not nominal but real interest rates, that is, the interest rate level obtained by subtracting inflation expectations from nominal interest rates. In this regard, the fact that inflation expectations in Japan were well below the price stability target of 2 percent provided a way to break through the 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   deflationary mindset: if the Bank could raise inflation expectations, real interest rates would fall, stimulating economic activity by firms and households. In this sense, raising inflation expectations is both an objective of QQE and, at the same time, the key to implementing the QQE transmission mechanism to overcome deflation. This raises the question of how people’s deflationary mindset can be changed and inflation expectations can be raised. For firms and households with a deflationary mindset to start thinking that “from now, we will act based on the assumption that prices will rise by about 2 percent every year,” it is necessary above all that the central bank fully commits itself to achieving 2 percent inflation. Based on these considerations, the Bank committed itself to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years, and to maintaining the target in a stable manner. And as a means to this end, the Bank introduced large-scale monetary easing in the form of QQE. A decline in real interest rates can be expected to stimulate private demand such as business fixed investment, private consumption, and housing investment. Such an increase in private demand in turn reduces the output gap, that is, the amount of slack in the economy as a whole, thereby putting upward pressure on prices. And once people actually experience inflation, this will boost their confidence in the Bank’s commitment, leading to a further rise in inflation expectations and reinforcing the aforementioned processes, forming a virtuous cycle. This is the mechanism through which QQE aims at raising inflation and inflation expectations to 2 percent. II. The practice of QQE Effects of QQE So far, I have talked about the theory of QQE, but to what extent has this policy actually been exerting any effects? First of all, as a result of the Bank’s massive purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), long-term interest rates have further declined. Ten-year JGB yields have recently been around 0.4 percent (Chart 4). Moreover, the average interest rate on new loans has declined to historic lows of about 0.9 percent. In addition, people’s perception of inflation has clearly changed. Various indicators of medium- to long-term inflation expectations show clear increases since the introduction of QQE. For example, the figure presented in the Consensus Forecast was 0.8 percent in October 2012 but has risen to 1.5 percent of late. Therefore, real interest rates, including longer-term ones, have become clearly negative. Also, people and businesses feel that, in their daily life, the inflation environment has been changing substantially. Let me cite two noteworthy examples. First, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive for 20 months since June 2013. This is the first time since 1998 that people have experienced inflation for such a long period. It means that this is the first time ever for people in their 20s or younger to experience rising prices. Second, since last year, nominal wages have been rising. Of particular note is that during the annual wage negotiations last spring, the so-called spring offensive, base pay rose for the first time in about 20 years, and rising base pay is likely to be seen in increasingly many firms this year. Both examples represent landmark changes for Japan, which has experienced deflation for such a long period. While the word “deflation” – defure in Japanese – had become part of everyday conversation, recently the term can rarely be heard. Furthermore, this momentum toward overcoming the deflationary mindset has continued even amid the decline in CPI inflation reflecting the effects of falling crude oil prices. Looking at indicators of inflation expectations, while market-based indicators such as the break-even inflation rate – as in Europe and the United States – have declined, various surveys of BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  
   economists and households suggest that medium- to long-term inflation expectations continue to be on an upward trend. We believe this is because the Bank’s expansion of QQE last October – undertaken as a preemptive response to the risk that falling crude oil prices could affect wage negotiations and price-setting by lowering inflation expectations – has been effective. As I have explained, QQE has been exerting its intended effects and it seems safe to say that QQE works both in theory and practice. The Bank believes that it can achieve the price stability target of 2 percent by continuing to steadily pursue QQE going forward. In the following, I will offer my view on the economic and price situation in more detail, and explain why I think that QQE will lead to the realization of the price stability target of 2 percent. Economic and price situation Let me start with economic activity. The corporate sector is buoyant. Profits have continued to improve and have reached new peaks (Chart 5). The decline in crude oil prices will further benefit the sector by reducing costs. In addition, exports and production have been picking up. In this situation, firms have maintained their positive investment stance and their demand for labor has remained strong. Against the backdrop of the strong demand for labor in the corporate sector, labor market conditions remain tight and Japan is close to full employment. Specifically, the unemployment rate has declined to around 3.5 percent, which is roughly the same level as the structural unemployment rate (Chart 6). The tightness in labor market conditions has been exerting upward pressure on nominal wages, which are expected to continue rising. Against the backdrop of this steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption as a whole has been firm. In this situation, downward pressure stemming from the decline in demand following the consumption tax hike has been waning. The decline in crude oil prices will also have a favorable effect on private consumption. Given the various tailwinds to economic activity, the Bank expects Japan’s real GDP growth in fiscal 2015 to be about 2 percent. In the Bank’s January interim assessment of the October 2014 Outlook Report for Economic Activity and Prices, the real GDP growth rate was projected to be 2.1 percent in fiscal 2015 and 1.6 percent in fiscal 2016 (Chart 7). In the current improving economic situation, the output gap has improved substantially mainly due to the tightening of the labor market. It has become about 0 percent, that is, close to the long-term average. Going forward, with Japan’s economy continuing to grow above its potential growth rate, which is estimated to be around 0.5 percent or lower, the output gap is expected to further improve. In addition, as mentioned earlier, medium- to long-term inflation expectations have remained on an uptrend. The underlying trend in inflation has been increasing as its two determinants, namely, the output gap and medium- to long-term inflation expectations, are improving. However, in terms of the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI excluding fresh food stripping out the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, inflation has slowed since last summer due mainly to the substantial decline in crude oil prices and registered 0.2 percent in January (Chart 8). Going forward, the rate of increase is expected to be about 0 percent due to the effects of the decline in energy prices and is likely to remain at that level for the time being. However, the underlying trend in inflation is expected to continue to steadily increase in the future. Therefore, as the effects of falling crude oil prices on the year-on-year rate of change, that is, the base effect, dissipate, CPI inflation will accelerate and achieving 2 percent CPI inflation will come in sight. Based on the assumption that crude oil prices will rise moderately from their recent levels, CPI inflation is expected to reach 2 percent in or around fiscal 2015 (Chart 7). The timing of this could be somewhat sooner or later than envisaged depending on developments in crude oil prices. However, if it is clear that the timing in which the 2 percent target will be achieved depends mainly on fluctuations in 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   energy prices, market participants will not draw any unwarranted conclusions with regard to monetary policy, as they know that the base effect caused by changes in energy prices will eventually disappear. Needless to say, the Bank maintains its policy stance that it will make adjustments as necessary without hesitation, when there are changes in the underlying trend in inflation, especially in developments in inflation expectations, in order to achieve the price stability target at the earliest possible time. III. The government’s growth strategy and the bank’s monetary policy To conclude my speech, I would like to talk about strengthening the growth potential of Japan’s economy. Japan’s potential growth rate has been on a declining trend since the 1990s (Chart 9). Reasons include demographic trends such as the decline in the working-age population as well as regulatory and institutional factors that have hindered corporate activities and impeded competition. In order to raise the growth potential, it is necessary to remove such factors that hamper private entities’ proactive economic activities. Consequently, it is encouraging that various regulatory and institutional reforms have steadily been implemented through the government’s growth strategy. In this context, I would like to highlight that overcoming deflation itself will contribute to raising Japan’s growth potential. Investment and innovation in the private sector are key to economic growth, and the role of the government’s growth strategy is to create an environment in which firms can thoroughly pursue business opportunities. In addition, overcoming deflation and achieving an economy and society in which economic entities take action on the assumption of 2 percent inflation will revive firms’ and households’ animal spirits. If that happens, people will start to take more risks and invest in new ventures, which in turn is likely to give rise to innovations. With firms and households becoming more proactive, it will become even clearer which regulatory and institutional aspects have hampered growth. I think one of the reasons why only some progress has been made in regulatory and institutional reforms is that the momentum toward reforms was lacking as private entities were not sufficiently proactive. The emergence of real needs for reforms will be a major driving force to push ahead with regulatory and institutional reforms. Under QQE, the deflationary mindset is steadily being dispelled. The Bank aims to contribute to strengthening the growth potential of Japan’s economy through its continued efforts through QQE and by achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. Concluding remarks Today, I have talked about the challenges facing Japan’s economy and the characteristics of QQE as a remedy for those challenges. The greatest lesson from Japan’s experience is that the best is not to fall into deflation in the first place, since there is the danger that, once the economy has fallen into it, deflation becomes protracted. If there is a risk of deflation, policy authorities should make every effort to prevent the economy from falling into it. Having said that, even if the economy becomes trapped in deflation, it is possible to overcome deflation through innovative monetary policy. By succeeding in getting the economy out of deflation through QQE, the Bank hopes to provide a case in point. If the Bank can show that even if the economy falls into deflation, there are policy measures to escape from it, this will strengthen confidence in central banks’ ability to achieve their price stability targets, which reinforces their ability to anchor inflation expectations. Well-anchored inflation expectations, in turn, help to prevent the economy from falling into and becoming trapped in deflation in the first place. In this regard, success of the Bank’s QQE has important implications not only for Japan’s economy but also for monetary policy around the globe. Thank you very much for your attention.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Alberto G Musalem: US macroeconomic and regulatory developments and emerging market economies Remarks by Mr Alberto G Musalem, Executive Vice President of the Integrated Policy Analysis Group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the International Financial Conference Annual Meeting, Cartagena, Colombia, 9 March 2015. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to speak here today. It has been a pleasure to attend this conference, and to have the opportunity to exchange views with many of you. My remarks today will focus on the potential effects of the U.S. outlook and policy for emerging market economies. I will make three main points. • The U.S. economy appears likely to make further progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. This actual and prospective improvement underlies market expectations that the FOMC will begin raising the Federal Funds rate sometime later this year. • Emerging market economies (EMEs) have generally performed well during U.S. tightening cycles, especially when such policy shifts are supported by effective communication in the context of U.S. growth. • There has been notable progress in improving the safety and soundness of the international and U.S. financial systems, to better support financial stability and economic growth. Before I turn to the specifics, let me remind you that what I say today reflects my own views, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. Since the end of the Great Recession almost six years ago, U.S. growth has averaged a somewhat disappointing 2.3 percent. But growth has picked up recently, and the latest Blue Chip forecast is for growth to average slightly below 3 percent over the next year. There are good reasons to think that a period of stronger growth can be sustained. • Household balance sheets are in much improved condition, with total household liabilities well below their 2008 peak, and debt service burdens at the lowest share of disposable income in more than 30 years. Moreover, consumers are benefitting from the positive wealth effect of higher house and equity prices. • Labor market improvement has picked up pace, with payrolls gains over the last several months the strongest since the mid-1990s. Workers are finally beginning to see at least modest real wage gains. And the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level since mid-2008. • The recent drop in oil prices is providing a significant boost to household spending power with nearly a percentage point increase to real disposable incomes. • The housing sector is now in much better balance. The inventory-sales ratio for homes is near, or even slightly below, levels typically considered “normal,” and there has been a significant drop in the fraction of households carrying mortgage balances in excess of the value of their homes. • The fiscal restraint that has held back growth in recent years has given way to a more neutral posture. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • The non-financial corporate sector remains in generally healthy condition, with high profit margins and a high ratio of liquid assets to current liabilities. Of course, there are important risks to the growth outlook including: whether households behave cautiously relative to fundamentals given the experience of the Great Recession; the extent of the impact to the oil producing sector from lower oil prices, and the direction of the business cycle abroad. The FOMC’s view in its January statement was that the risks to U.S. growth are nearly balanced. There are also risks in both directions to the inflation outlook. Headline inflation has fallen quite low due to the drop in oil prices. These effects are likely to be transitory. Measures of underlying inflation such as the core PCE deflator have been running somewhat short of the FOMC’s 2 percent objective for some time. Moreover, market-based measures of medium-term inflation compensation have fallen somewhat below the objective in recent months, even if survey measures of expectations have held essentially steady. There are also upside risks to inflation. The unemployment rate has declined and wage growth should firm as remaining slack diminishes. Moreover, the U.S. economy’s productivity performance has been relatively unimpressive in recent quarters. If continued, this could also begin to push inflation higher. It is in this context that the Committee has begun to consider the appropriate timing and pace for removing extraordinary accommodation. The Committee stated in January that “it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,” and that the timing of any policy shift will be data dependent, based on an ongoing careful evaluation of progress towards the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.1 Emerging market officials and market participants have expressed concerns that Fed liftoff might spark an undue tightening in global financial conditions, creating a new growth headwind for emerging market economies. These concerns are understandable. The Federal Funds rate has been near the zero lower bound for more than six years. The Taper Tantrum in the spring and summer of 2013 provides a ready reminder of the potential for volatility around actual or perceived news concerning Fed policy. Like other central banks, the Fed’s monetary policy mandate is defined in domestic terms. Yet the Fed takes the potential international implications of its policies quite seriously. In part, this comes from a sense of a special responsibility given the international reserve currency status of the dollar. An outward-looking perspective is also warranted because the international effects of Fed policies can spill back onto the U.S. economy and financial conditions. It is of note that emerging market economic performance during previous Fed tightening cycles has generally been good. During the last three U.S. tightening cycles, EME industrial production growth has come to between 7½ and 10 percent over the 12 months from the start of Fed tightening, while EME export volumes have risen 10 to 15 percent. A likely explanation for this favorable record is that Fed tightening generally occurs during periods of strong U.S. economic performance. Recent research from the IMF bears out this hypothesis, finding that higher U.S. interest rates associated with stronger U.S. growth represent a net positive for EMEs.2 Financial performance of EMEs has been more diverse across Fed policy cycles. The strongest contrast is between the tightening cycle that began in 2004, and the one beginning                                                 1  See January 27–28, 2015 Federal Open Market Committee statement. 2  See “Spillovers from Unwinding Monetary Support in Advanced Economies,” 2014 Spillover Report, Chapter 2.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  a decade earlier, in 1994. EME asset prices strengthened considerably during the 2004 cycle, but weakened considerably during the earlier cycle. Notably, the 1994 cycle was associated with a large increase in U.S. long-term bond yields, and appears to represent a case in which there was some distance between Fed policy and market expectations. Other IMF research suggests that anticipated Fed tightening moves have historically been followed by only a minor pullback in private capital inflows, while unanticipated tightening has typically been followed by a pullback in private flows some four times as large.3 This evidence highlights the importance of transparency and clear messaging in how the Fed is evaluating the evolving economic landscape. The FOMC has taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve communications. This includes press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of growth and inflation forecasts of FOMC participants; participants’ projections of the Federal Funds rate at various horizons; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward its mandate. These steps are aimed at reducing the risk that Fed policy adjustment might be associated with undue market volatility. The stance of Fed policy will be far from the only thing affecting the global landscape facing EMEs. As the FOMC considers the appropriate timing and pace of moving to a less accommodative policy stance, central banks in the Euro area and Japan are in the process of implementing additional easing measures. Other important factors affecting the global terrain include China’s slowing of credit growth without derailing economic growth, the behavior of oil and other commodity prices, and EMEs’ own domestic fundamentals and growth dynamics. Fed policy will be only one factor. EME fundamentals are likely to be an important determinant of how EME financial conditions respond to Fed policy normalization. This was one of the key lessons from the Taper Tantrum. At first, market pressure was somewhat indiscriminant and then later became more discerning with respect to EME fundamentals. Financial conditions tightened, especially for countries with fundamental vulnerabilities including: large current account deficits, a heavy reliance on portfolio inflows, and high and above-target inflation rates. Markets then responded favorably as EME authorities shifted toward clear, more consistent policies focused on inflation objectives and external sustainability, and away from policies with multiple and sometimes competing objectives. Let me now add a few thoughts about ongoing financial reform efforts. The complexity, severity and speed of the global financial crisis required a forceful and wide-ranging international regulatory response. This has included higher capital and liquidity standards, stronger recovery and resolution regimes for supervised institutions, and greater transparency and standardization in derivatives markets. These efforts will have a number of positive effects, although they may lead to some changes in bank business models and strategy in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., these efforts have made the banking system much stronger today than before the crisis. In aggregate, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios among U.S. bank holding companies have increased to just under 13 percent, an increase of almost 45 percent relative to pre-crisis levels, and the quality of capital has improved. Bank holding company balance sheets are also significantly more liquid, with liquid assets increasing from 26 percent of total assets at end-2006 to 38 percent at end-2014. Core deposits now fund 44 percent of total assets, a 10 percentage point increase from pre-crisis levels. A stronger U.S. banking system better protects against future shocks, provides a more solid foundation for growth, and therefore also enhances prospects for growth and financial stability abroad.                                                 3  “International Capital Flows: Reliable or Fickle?” World Economic Outlook, April 2011, Chapter 4. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Basel III implementation has been proceeding on a comparable basis in advanced and emerging market countries. The Financial Stability Board has been monitoring the unintended effects of reforms on EME banks and EMEs report no significant adverse effects.4 However, potential differences in reform implementation across jurisdictions could create challenges, particularly in countries where foreign banks are active. This underscores the importance of continued home and host coordination. I would like to briefly touch on two U.S.-specific financial regulatory issues with international implications, namely enhanced prudential standards for foreign banks, including intermediate holding company requirements for the largest institutions, and issues surrounding correspondent banking, U.S. anti-money laundering rules, and “de-risking”. Of these, the latter may have the most relevance for the EMEs broadly. The adoption of enhanced prudential standards for foreign banking organizations (FBOs) is a key element of U.S. regulatory reforms, and a significant change in supervision of FBOs.5 The largest FBOs (with U.S. non-branch assets greater than $50 billion) must hold their U.S. subsidiaries under an intermediate holding company (IHC), and meet various capital, leverage, liquidity, stress testing, risk management and corporate governance requirements. These requirements respond to a mandate in the Dodd-Frank Act for enhanced standards for the largest domestic and foreign banks. The most significant requirements are expected to fall on the largest FBOs from advanced economies – some of which have also adopted tighter local requirements for foreign banks – and should contribute importantly to a safer and sounder U.S. and international financial system. Correspondent banking relationships have also received heightened attention in the context of serious violations of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer standards by some banks, and substantial fines. It is imperative to firmly deal with illegal, unsafe and unsound banking practices, including money laundering and transactions with U.S.-sanctioned countries. It is also important to be on the look-out for potential unintended consequences and externalities, such as widespread de-risking where correspondent bank access is shut off to compliant counter parties and to legal flows, economic costs are excessively increased, or flows migrate to avenues subject to less oversight or transparency. The scope, scale, and impact of de-risking need to be better understood. Dialogue between market participants and the official sector is ongoing, both multilaterally and bilaterally. Let me conclude. The U.S. economy and financial system have strengthened notably in recent years and in a mutually reinforcing way. U.S. monetary and regulatory policy both need to be tailored to domestic conditions. The Fed is also mindful of the international effects of its policies, given the central place of the U.S. in the global financial system, and the potential for spillbacks to the U.S. economy and financial system. Effective communication with market participants and policymakers is important. The opportunity for dialogue is what makes conferences such as this one valuable.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Arjuna Mahendran: Role of the Central Bank in the Sri Lankan context Speech by Mr Arjuna Mahendran, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the Sri Lanka Legal Summit 2015 “Governance, Regulation and Investment – The Way Forward“, Colombo, 5 March 2015. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I am greatly privileged to address your distinguished audience on this topic with which I am reasonably conversant. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka today is a talking point among the public. Further, world over, central banks are in the public eye due to their specific role in staring off the global financial crisis, which caused a mini depression in 2009. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is probably the single state authority with enormous influence in the economy and economic welfare of the general public. This influence comes from the powers and functions conferred upon the Central Bank from a number of statutes led by the Monetary Law Act (MLA) of 1949. In my view, when compared with statutes governing Central Banks in other countries, MLA is the single piece of legislation that provides for time invariant powers and functions of the Central Bank. The law has worked reasonably well during last 65 years without any major amendments. The drafting of the law in 1949 has been supervised by the renowned economist Mr. John Exter from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who also in recognition of his stellar efforts was the first Governor of the Central Bank. In his report submitted to the Government on establishment of the Central Bank, he stated as follows. I quote “the broad powers given to the Central Bank of Ceylon under the draft bill in Part II of this report are commensurate with the magnitude of this responsibility. The Bank should not be hampered by rigid limitations which might prevent it from fulfilling its purpose. When a new central bank is being established it is impossible to predict the course of its development. This will depend upon the environment within which it works and upon those who, determine its policies. Many of its powers may go unused for long periods, because they are designed for particular situations, some of which may never arise. Others are intended for use only in crises or to forestall a crisis, but prudence dictates that they be included now, so that they will be at hand in case of need. It would be foolhardy to assume, with the record of the war – and depression – induced economic crises of the last 30 years plainly before us, that the Ceylon economy will somehow escape such crises in the future. The safer assumption is the one underlying the drafting of the present bill: it is better in an uncertain economic world to be prepared for any eventuality. Many features of the draft bill have been developed in the Western Hemisphere. Others are found in one form or another in central banking legislation within the Commonwealth. The basic pattern is suited for countries which are introducing central banking systems for the first time because it contains certain signposts and warning signals which should prove useful to administrators who do not have long established traditions and years of personal experience upon which to rely. It also provides a legal structure which is flexible and adaptable to changing economic conditions. Within the structure there is ample room for the development of policies that are appropriate to the times. Good central banking is less good law than good practice. The Central Bank of Ceylon may make its influence felt more effectively through the development of day-to-day relations of confidence and understanding between itself and the various banking institutions than through the exercise of all of the powers given it under this bill. Such influence is known in the textbooks as “moral suasion” and should be especially important in a small country where 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  it should be possible to develop close relations between the Central Bank and each of the fairly limited number of banking institutions…..” Having worked as an economist in the Central Bank and banker and investment banker in global financial environment, I perfectly understand what Mr. Exter meant. I invite you all to read the Exter Report if you are interested in knowing what type of institution the Central Bank is? I would pray that you, after reading the Exter Report, may not complain that Central Bank has not done enough to Sri Lanka economy and economic welfare of the public in terms of the mandate given to it by the public. The Central Bank’s all powers and functions center around two objectives. Those are the securing of economic and price stability and financial system stability with a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka. This is not the forum for me to define technically each objective as there is no single accepted definition. However, those objectives in nutshell mean securing stability of the economy. Economic and price stability means the economy running on a sustainable growth path with a supportive low rate inflation. Financial system stability means financial institutions and markets operate without bubbles or contagious failures where the trust of the public in the financial system is maintained, stability of the Economy, prices and the financial system are inter-dependent. The stability of the Economy helps the public to make and keep their plans for the future which ultimately encourages and promotes development of productive resources of Sri Lanka. This is what will promote living standard of the public by increasing production, employment and real income. This is what the MLA has empowered the Central Bank to do. Thus, you may understand the enormous national interest entrusted to the Central Bank. For securing these objectives, the Central Bank has been granted the authority for administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka through actions authorized by the MLA. Therefore, we must clearly understand the scope of our mandate. The Central Bank cannot directly undertake business to provide employment or create income or construct buildings to promote financial or business centers. The Central Bank’s scope of mandate for the stability of Sri Lanka economy is essentially the regulation and supervision of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the functions or activities the Central Bank carries out in its normal operations are the issue of the currency or legal tender, implementation of monetary policy, supervision of banks and financial institutions, management of an international reserve, operation of payment systems and financial related services to the Government as the Government agent. How the Central Bank carries out these functions with the help of nearly 1,500 staff is a complex and technical subject. The judiciary and legal community present today here may recall a number of court cases being heard now and judgments delivered in the past connected with certain operations of the Central Bank, because either Central Bank procedures are not prudent for safeguarding the public trust or the public ignored the scope of the mandate of the Central Bank to get involved in financial sector developments. For example, the Central Bank is a respondent in all court cases recently filed in connection with unauthorized and failed investment schemes as the petitioners are of the view that the Central Bank is responsible for the loss of investors’ money. Let me therefore elaborate on Central Bank functions. First, the issue of currency Central banking is a concept originated from the issue of currency. In the evolution of money, private banks started issuing their own bank notes, initially based on their gold holding and later as their own liabilities. The bank in which the public placed the highest trust started operating as a central bank in the market. Later in the history, legislation was brought to empower the Central Bank to print bank notes or currency which function as the intermediary between all economic transactions. Currency in issue at present in Sri Lanka is about 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Rs. 422 billion and is a liability of the Central Bank, even as it is an asset to the rest of us. The Central Bank is prepared to pay against any currency note in any other value of legal tender preferred by the public. The Central Bank maintains a cash counter for this. In order to protect the public trust in currency, the Central Bank primarily undertakes two actions. First, it attempts to issue currency notes with intrinsic material security making it difficult for counterfeiting and designs are chosen to facilitate easy recognition of different currency notes by people including the blind. Still, the world over currency counterfeiting and design concerns prevail irrespective of modern technology. Second, it attempts to protect the real value of currency by maintaining inflation at low levels through monetary policy. If prices or inflation rise day by day, the value of currency in terms of goods and services it can buy gets less and less and people will tend to dispense with currency as money and tend to use other international currencies as their preferred media of exchange. In such events, the currency system will collapse and the existence of the Central Bank will be questioned. This happened in Germany in 1920 and Zimbabwe in recent years. Second, the conduct of monetary policy Monetary Policy contains measures to regulate the supply, availability, cost and international exchange of the country’s money. Accordingly, levels of interest rates, exchange rate and credit in the economy are under the control of the Central Bank. These economic variables determine almost all economic activities of the public such as investments, savings, international transactions, production and employment. Their changes first affect our expenditure (what is called aggregate demand) its impact on production, income and employment. This course of effects is termed the monetary policy transmission mechanism. As these variables are part and parcel of our day-to-day life and their effects vary on different segments of people, the world over Central Banks get their fair share of praise or blame for whatever ensues in the economy. Savers criticize the Central Bank for low interest rates whereas producers who fund their production activities from bank loans appreciate low interest regime. The Central Bank is also routinely criticized by various segments for its policy for managing the exchange rate. Ultimately, the Central Bank manages monetary policy to suit its mandate to secure the objectives it priorities, given the economic knowledge of the authorized officers and the Monetary Board Members. It is the monetary policy that determines how much money the Central Bank should print to facilitate the economy. Under the MLA, the Central Bank has the powers to print money by acquiring several kinds of assets. Those assets are provisional advances to Government, purchase of Government securities, purchase of foreign exchange and lending to banks. In conducting monetary policy, the Central Bank determines the annual growth of money desirable for the economy taking into consideration price inflation and production growth. In line with the desirable growth of money, the Central Bank maintains its asset growth to facilitate new money required. In the US and Euro area during the last six years, central banks have been expanding their assets many times to print money so that the economy is flooded with money to be invested in production and creating employment while keeping interest rates at rear zero levels. Third, regulation and supervision of banks and financial institutions Banking, finance and leasing businesses fall within the purview of the Central Bank under the MLA and relevant statutes. State supervision according to the global literature has three specific dimensions. i.e., the prudential aspect, conduct of sound business and consumer protection. Prudential supervision promotes the safety and soundness of institutions through their risk management. Conduct of sound business supervision covers fair and orderly conduct of businesses. Consumer protection covers safeguarding interest of consumers. The Central Bank’s supervision mainly covers prudential supervision in three areas, i.e., issues of regulations, examinations and problem resolution. Issues of regulations covers maximum limits on business to limit risks, minimum requirements on risk mitigation instruments such as 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  minimum capital, liquidity, loan loss provisions and governance. Periodical examinations cover the assessment of risk management capacity and early warnings of impending problems to take early remedial actions. Problem resolution covers solution to institutions in crisis or distress such as restructuring, bailing out and liquidation. This supervision has two perspectives at the Micro and Macro levels. Micro supervision means dealing with individual institutions. Macro supervision means actions to protect the system stability. Although the differentiation between the two is barely understood by many, the central banks’ supervisory actions are clearly understood from how central banks have acted in crisis times. The best example is permitting the failure of small ailing institutions and bailing out of systemically important institutions. However, the customers of each ailing institution want the Central Bank to bail them out, despite risky behaviour of both customers and institutions. The Central Bank has no mandate to bail out each such institution and repay their investments. Similarly, the Central Bank cannot reasonably be held responsible for institutions and persons engaged in banking, finance and leasing businesses without authority. Such unauthorized institutions attract investments by offering unusual products. The persons associated with such institutions are usually preying on greed, bypassing many licensed institutions in the country. They oppose the Central Bank when they are investigated, but they start blaming the Central Bank when they start failing. The Central Bank has traditionally strived away from intervening such failed unauthorized institutions. However, in response to public pressure, the bank may take a more interventionist approach, henceforth. Fourth, maintenance of a foreign reserve This is a responsibility of the Monetary Board. International reserve as authorized under MLA should consists of gold and liquid foreign currency assets such as foreign currency notes, foreign government securities, deposits with international banks and international fund transfer instruments Greek bonds. Such reserve has been about 70% – 80% of assets of the Central Bank. There is a misunderstanding even among staff of the Central Bank that the foreign reserve should be managed like assets portfolio with a preferred risk- return balance for business and profit. This is wrong. International reserve under MLA is a reserve, not a trading portfolio, held for the purpose of meeting foreseeable deficit in the international balance of payment of the country and thereby to support greater exchange rate stability and free use of Sri Lanka rupee for current international transactions. Therefore, international reserves should comprise a highly liquid reserve without any known or estimated risk-taking. These days, some people are concerned about the fall of this international reserve. Some complain that the reserve contains funds mobilized by the Government through foreign borrowing and not from net receipts from trade. Those views are subject to various technical arguments. What the Central Bank does is; it buys excess foreign exchange in the market and sells out of its reserve to meet the deficit in the market in order to maintain the exchange rate at a desirable level, given the relevant economic circumstances. If the reserve falls short of desired level, the Central Bank has the standard arrangements to replenish it. This reserve at US$ 7 billion at present is adequate to pay for four months of imports or 70% of the country’s short-term foreign borrowing if the necessity arises. The reserve is there for use in rainy days, not for showing off imaginary visits of a country living within its means. Fifth, Supply of payments and settlements services Economic transactions are essentially the receipts and payments made through cash and non-cash methods. Non-cash payments such as cheques and fund transfers need systems to ensure that the payment is received by the due receivers. The Central Bank maintains cheque clearing through LankaClear system. That is why you get your cheque realized on the same day, if deposited before 12.00 noon. Further, all fund transfers among the banks are cleared and settled through the Central Bank’s RTGS system. In the RTGS, the Central Bank provides intra-day funding to deficit banks to settle payments. Such payments services 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  make the payments safer and faster. Payments are the circulation of money which is the life blood of the economy. Sixth, agent of the government This is the function that leads to a lot of criticism on the independence of the Central Bank. Six most important agency functions are the management of public debt, fiscal agent, official depository, financial adviser, management of Employees’ Provident Fund and Administration of Exchange Control Act. The most important agency function of the Central Bank is the financial/economic adviser to the Government. In this regard, as the Central Bank is responsible for the monetary policy in its entire scope and escalation. Conventionally central banks have had the responsibility to advise the Government on fiscal and other operations to the extent that they impinge on the economy and advise as to what should be the best course of policy action for the economy. Given the nature of the central banks’ functions, advance access to macroeconomic and financial information and their expertise, central banks are the closest economic advisers to the Government. The Central Bank statutorily submits a number of reports such as the Central Bank Annual Report as part of this advice. In addition, the Central Bank provides advice on various policy matters on an on-going basis to the Government. However, central banks world over are blamed for not providing constructive and impartial advice because of the independence issue. I will talk on central bank independence in a moment. As the Manager of Public Debt, the Central Bank raises local and foreign debt to meet expenditures approved through the Consolidated Fund, maintains such loan records and service such loans out of funds at Government Account with the Central Bank. The popular criticism here is the monetization of the budget deficit through Central Bank funds. The Central Bank’s purchase of Treasury bills is the cause of this criticism. The Central Bank purchases Treasury bills in order to use them for regulation of the domestic market liquidity (Open Market Operations) as permitted in the MLA and not for lending to Government. Further, under the MLA, the Central Bank is authorized to provide provisional advances to the Government up to 10% of the estimated Government revenue of the current financial year, subject to recovery of each advance within 6 months, and such advances are only to meet the expenditures authorized under the Consolidated Fund. Managing public debt by the Central Bank is beneficial for the country since the Central Bank can raise public debt in line with interest rate structure envisaged in its monetary policy. If the debt management is undertaken by a separate Government office, it may attempt to raise debts without regard to market interest rates and monetary policy and that will cause immense conflicts with the current monetary policy. The opposite view is that as the Central Bank manages public debt, its monetary policy is constrained by the need to attempt to raise and maintain public debt at low cost. The Central Bank as the banker to the Government maintains accounts of the General Treasury and Government institutions and agencies. The Treasury Account, known as DST Account, is the main transaction account to handle public debt flows. In terms of the MLA, Government or Government institutions and agencies must obtain the advice of the Monetary Board on the implications if any borrowing on the monetary conditions before raising such debts. This is to ensure that Government borrowing is made with the concurrence of the Monetary Board in line with the monetary policy. Two other important agency functions are the management of Employees’ Provident Fund and administration of Exchange Control Act, both of which have evolved controversy. In the case of Employees’ Provident Fund, the Monetary Board is empowered to manage the fund including investment of surplus funds in securities the Monetary Board considers fit. I know you have heard enough on some of the EPF investments made in the recent past. Given the nature of the EPF and responsibilities of the Government, EPF funds are, I would submit meant only for safer investments. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The Exchange Control Act is to regulate and manage foreign exchange flows of the country which is essentially a part of macroeconomic management. In economics, exchange controls are about the regulation of the quantity or volume in the foreign exchange market. Conversely, the Central Bank regulates the price or exchange rate in the market under the MLA. Therefore, provisions of the Exchange Control Act strengthen the macro-economic policy hand of the Central Bank. In nutshell, implementation of the Exchange Control Act is focused nowadays to facilitate financing investment – savings gap of the country through foreign resources which is essential for the development of the country. At present, foreign exchange transactions involving trade, services, travel and most of foreigners’ investments are largely free capital transactions of residents are subject to controls. You will appreciate that, if not for the exchange control liberalization since 1977, the country’s economic development and living standard would not have achieved at present level. Consequences from previous regulatory interventions There are both success stories and consequences from previous regulatory interventions in the market. This is common to any central bank. I wish to brief you few issues and challenges confronted in the past and the way forward. The Central Bank’s intervention in 1988/89 finance companies crisis could bailout depositors to some extent and get new laws passed to regulate finance companies. However, the Central Bank lost public funds amounting to Rs. 6 billion (need to check.) and the COPE is still complaining about the Central Bank not being able to recover money. Again after 10 years, finance company crisis hit in another form where depositors have lost their savings in the failed companies and the Central Bank has been unable to resolve the crisis even after six years. In line with the new Government’s announced policy, the Central Bank now gives the priority to it to have due justice to the depositors. We need to fix the finance companies sector and their risky business models through strong regulation and market discipline. Otherwise, this sector will pose risk to the financial system stability in next 10 years. Another regulatory intervention that created immense macro economic consequences was the attempt to appreciate and maintain the currency highly over-valued during the period 2009 – 2012 at around Rs. 109 – 110 per US Dollar. For this purpose, the Central Bank lost about US$ 3.5 billion of foreign reserves leading to a foreign exchange crisis. Finally, crisis was managed by raising a loan of US$ 2.6 billion from the IMF to restore the international reserve and allowing a sharp depreciation of the currency to around Rs. 134 per US$ in June 2012. This intervention led to raise interest rate, control credit and raise fuel prices which had dampening impact on the growth of the economy reducing to 6.3% in 2012. In this regard, although some raise concerns over current intervention in the exchange rate, we are comfortable with current level of international reserve, pending already arranged inflow of foreign resources to strengthen the reserve. Another case in point is the Pramuka Bank failure in 2002 – 2004. The Central Bank’s decision to liquidate the bank was challenged in the Court of Appeal which quashed the Central Bank decision on the ground that the Central Bank had not followed the due procedure given in the Banking Act. Finally, the Government as a part of political decision in the interest of depositors bailed out the bank by vesting the bank with a new state bank set up for the purpose. If the Central Bank was conscious of its responsibilities, it could have resorted to a different path to resolve the bank at the very early stage. World over, central banks are blamed for delayed action, not effective to resolve problems. World over, regulators fall behind the market although they are expected to correct the market. Regulators are burdened with laws, procedures and bureaucracy and lack of latest market information. They work for office hours. However, market participants work 24 hours and are innovative for regulatory arbitrage. The human greed supported with moral hazard of regulation creates bubbles cyclically leading to financial and economic crises from time to time. The regulators and politicians create new laws, but they fail to prevent the next bubble. As a person being in both regulator and markets, I will do a lot of work to address this 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  universal issue hopefully. However, as financial regulators cannot control the greed, financial bubbles and crises are to happen. Finally, the Central Bank independence is the confusing and very technical subject. No Central Bank is divine. Central banks are also state institutions, but with greater functional independence provided for in the respective statutes due to its specific nature of operations involving printing of money and conducting monetary policies. The simple reason for the central bank independence is that a Government cannot have one hand to spend through the fiscal policy and other hand to print money to finance expenditure through the monetary policy. Therefore, the clear separation between the Treasury and Central Bank is necessary, otherwise, economies and monetary systems will collapse sooner or later. Therefore, the Central Bank independence and the close co-operation between the Central Bank and the Treasury are highly recognized. I wish to quote from the Exter Report on this matter as the best piece of literature. I quote “….There are, however, many important problems of monetary policy, especially those relating to fiscal policy, on which a central bank must necessarily work in close harmony with the government. On such problems, experience in many countries has shown that a central bank with a degree of independence of the government proper can make economic analyses and hold views which are more detached and objective than those of a government department. Many governments have learned to value and to use the sort of independent and objective advice on monetary and other aspects of economic policy which central banks have been able to give. On matters of vital interest to the state, however, it must be recognized that even in the absence of some such formula as the British or the Australian, it would be impossible for the Central Bank to adopt a policy or pursue a course of action contrary to the policy of the Government of the day. No agency which is a creature of the Government can be entirely independent of the Government. While the Government may be prepared to give an independent regulatory agency rather wide discretion in a field such as that of money, there is no gain-saying that in the last analysis the Government must assume responsibility for monetary policy as for other policies. The Governor and the appointed member of the Monetary Board cannot help being acutely conscious of the fact that, since no Parliament can bind its successors, their independence and tenure in office under the proposed legislation is limited by the ultimate power of the Government to change the law. The exact degree and independence of the Central Bank is likely to vary from time to time. For example, central banks can ordinarily act more independently in stable, peace-time economic conditions than in time of war or other national emergency. They also tend to take stronger stands on issues which are primarily monetary in character than on related issues which may simply have monetary repercussions. The ideal which it is hoped that the proposed law will achieve is one in which there will be continuous and constructive co-operation between the Monetary Board and the Government. The principal instrument for achieving this co-operation should be the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Finance whose membership on the Board will ensure at all times that his Minister’s views will be made known to the other members of the Board. The effectiveness of this co-operation and co-ordination between the Board and the Government will depend more upon the men occupying the key positions at particular times than upon any legal formula, no matter how carefully or elaborately it might be worked out. A relationship as complex, and sometimes as delicate, as this one is certain to be, cannot be established full-blown by a piece of legislation. It must be the result, as in other countries, of years of experience and the slow growth of political conventions. One further point is well worth making. There is a clear need in Ceylon for some sort of economic council at Cabinet level to achieve improved co-ordination of Government economic policies. If in future such a council is set up it is suggested that the Governor of the Central Bank should have a place upon it……” 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Finally, officers of the central banks are not gods to know all problems in advance and give 100% solutions. We are all human beings and make mistakes. But we need to do things in an accountable manner and use our statutory discretion credibly to protect the public trust in us. For that we need to maintain credible procedures for decision-making where the public and courts can scrutinize to judge whether we have made decisions in fair manner considering all available information. In that regard, the Central Bank has long way to go. My initial days of office are spent to put in place these procedures in line with the mandate and nature of public interest. I know it is not easy to change things that have been there for long time. A lot of sacrifices are necessary. Ladies and Gentlemen, I know what I have stated here are confusing you enough. However, I am sure you had some technical insight into the Central Bank. I have no doubt you now appreciate that the Central Bank is the heart of the economy as many state so. Thank you very much for listening to me. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Daniel K Tarullo: Application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies Testimony by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, Washington DC, 19 March 2015. *      *      * Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify on the threshold in section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) for application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies. In my testimony this morning I will try to provide, from a regulator’s perspective, some context for the committee’s consideration of this subject by explaining how the Federal Reserve has differentially implemented prudential regulations based on the size, scope, and range of activities of banking organizations, as well as how we have organized our supervisory portfolios. In both our supervisory and regulatory practices, we are pursuing a tiered approach to prudential oversight. Regulatory differentiation in the Dodd-Frank Act Traditionally, statutes creating prudential regulatory requirements or authorities generally took what might be termed a unitary approach. That is, the statutes simply made a particular requirement or authority applicable to banks or banking organizations generally, with few clear distinctions based on the characteristics of the regulated entities. The federal banking agencies did adopt some regulations with requirements that applied only to larger institutions. And, as I will describe a bit later, through supervisory practice they administered some statutory requirements differently based on the size of banks and the scope of their activities. But the starting point was a more or less similar set of statutory requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act explicitly broke with this traditional approach by creating prudential requirements that vary with the size or systemic importance of banking organizations. Of particular importance is the Dodd-Frank Act emphasis on financial stability, both in markets generally and with respect to the largest financial firms, which had been associated with market perceptions that they were too big to fail. The law created some new authorities for financial regulators and instructed regulators to use authorities they already had to put in place regulations to contain systemic risk. As to regulations applicable to individual firms, the Dodd-Frank Act creates thresholds for various prudential regulations at asset sizes of $1 billion, $10 billion, and $50 billion. Of special note is that section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to establish enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with total assets of $50 billion or more and other financial firms designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Among other areas, these standards include capital, liquidity, risk management, resolution planning, and single-counterparty credit limits. Of particular significance is the section 165 requirement that these enhanced standards increase in stringency depending on the size, interconnectedness, role in credit intermediation, and other factors specified in the law. In addition to these enhanced, graduated standards, section 165 requires that firms with greater than $50 billion in assets be subject to annual supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve has implemented the section 165 requirement of graduated stringency for enhanced prudential standards by creating what are, in effect, three categories within the universe of banking organizations with $50 billion or more in assets. As required by statute, all firms within this universe are subject to basic enhanced standards. Firms with assets of between $50 billion and $250 billion are subject only to these basic enhanced standards. Firms with at least $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign assets are also subject to more stringent requirements, including the advanced approaches risk-based 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  capital requirements, the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, and the full-scope liquidity coverage ratio. Finally, the eight U.S. bank holding companies that have been designated as global systemically important banking organizations will be subject to an additional set of regulatory requirements. An enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, equally applicable to all eight firms, has already been adopted. We are also working on two requirements that will vary in stringency even among these eight firms, based on their relative systemic importance. One is the set of risk-based capital surcharges for which we issued a notice of proposed rulemaking late last year. The other, on which we anticipate issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the coming months, is a long-term debt requirement designed to support effective orderly resolution processes. In sum, the stringency of the Federal Reserve’s prudential regulations increases in proportion to the systemic importance of the banking organizations. With this tiered approach to regulation, the Federal Reserve aims not only to achieve the Dodd-Frank Act goal of mitigating risks to U.S. financial stability, but to do so in a manner that limits regulatory costs and the expenditure of supervisory resources where not needed to promote safety, soundness, and financial stability. Tiered regulatory and supervisory experience The Federal Reserve also takes a tiered approach to supervision. We organize the firms we supervise into portfolios based predominately, although not exclusively, on asset size. We have four such groups: (1) community banking organizations, which are generally those with $10 billion or less in total assets; (2) regional banking organizations, which have total assets between $10 billion and $50 billion; (3) large banking organizations, which have total assets over $50 billion but are not among the largest and most complex banking organizations; and (4) firms overseen by the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC), which are the largest and most complex banking organizations.1 As with tiered regulation, our tiered supervision is intended to take into account differences in business models, risks, relative regulatory burdens, and other salient considerations. Where specific regulatory goals for the different portfolios vary, the supervisory programs reflect those differences. And even where the goals are similar across portfolios, supervisory programs should nevertheless take account of the differences among the firms in the four portfolios. In general, we shape our supervisory expectations for each portfolio by considering the increase in safety and soundness that we are likely to achieve through a specific practice or requirement, in light of the regulatory costs for the banking organizations in the portfolio and the impact that the stress or failure of those institutions would likely have on credit intermediation, the deposit insurance fund, and financial stability. So, for example, there are heightened expectations with regard to corporate governance for large banking organizations that are not applied to regional or community banking organizations. Among other areas, the Federal Reserve expects the boards of directors of these larger firms to set direction and oversight for revenue and profit generation, risk management, and control functions; to ensure that senior management has the expertise and level of involvement required to manage core business lines, critical operations, banking offices, and other material entities; and to maintain a corporate culture that emphasizes the importance of compliance with laws, regulation, and consumer protection. While strong corporate governance is important at all banking organizations, it is vital at large banking organizations, given that their systems and operations are typically much broader and more                                                 1  For more information on the LISCC, see http://federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  complex than those of the smaller-scale and more localized regional and community banking organizations. While asset size is the principal determinant of the general supervisory program for a banking organization, other factors are taken into account as appropriate. For example, if a regional banking organization were to become involved in activities typically undertaken only by larger banking organizations, we might add to that firm’s supervision an expectation or practice drawn from the large banking organization portfolio. Moreover, in determining which banking organizations belong in the LISCC portfolio, the Federal Reserve has focused on the risks to the financial system posed by individual firms – size has not been the dispositive factor. For example, three large banking organizations are not in that portfolio, even though they have larger balance sheets than the processing- and custody-focused bank holding companies that are in the LISCC portfolio. The stress or failure of these large, essentially regional banking organizations could have a serious effect on credit intermediation across a significant part of the country and, in some situations of generalized stress, might have consequences for the financial system as a whole. However, we judge that the functions of the two processing- and custody-focused LISCC firms implicate systemic concerns to a greater extent than the substantial balance sheets of the larger regionals. The role of statutory thresholds As I hope by now is apparent, the Federal Reserve has done considerable work to tailor our supervision of banking organizations by reference to their size, business model, and systemic importance. Similarly, using the statutory discretion granted us, and frequently in cooperation with other regulatory agencies, we have also tailored the application of certain statutory requirements to different groups of banks. The question of statutory thresholds is thus a fairly narrow one: Does a threshold specify a cut-off point that is appropriate for mandatory application of a particular regulatory requirement, taking into account whatever discretion is given to the implementing regulatory agencies? In answering this question, it is first worth noting the case for establishing such statutory thresholds. In the past, Congress has at times not simply given the banking agencies authority to engage in a particular form of prudential regulation, but has required that they do so. Capital regulation and prompt correction action are two examples. Not coincidentally, I think, congressional action followed banking crises that revealed possible shortcomings in the regulatory and supervisory structures that had existed preceding the crisis. In requiring certain kinds of prudential regulation, Congress was in effect protecting against memories of those problems fading and the consequent possibility of supervisory relaxation, which might allow for a recurrence of similar banking problems in the future. The creation of mandatory thresholds for certain enhanced prudential standards is an important advance in the traditional congressional role of specifying a set of mandatory regulations. This statutory structure recognizes the substantially divergent risks presented to the economy and the financial system by the potential stress or failure of banking organizations of different sizes and with different activities, while preserving considerable discretion for the banking agencies in implementing those regulations. Here again, statutory enactment of mandatory measures for banking organizations of a certain size or systemic importance serves as a form of safeguard against the erosion of prudential oversight that could occur were predominant reliance to be placed on the details of firm-specific supervision, which are sometimes hard for the public to discern. Removal or change of such thresholds, as with generally applicable prudential requirements, will thus require congressional action and an occasion for considered public debate on the merits of such change. Experience to date, however, suggests that there are some statutory thresholds that might bear reexamination. One pertains to the applicability of some Dodd-Frank Act provisions to community banks. For example, the Volcker rule and the incentive compensation 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  requirements of section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act are directed at concerns generally present only with larger institutions, but the Volcker rule by its terms applies to all banking organizations, and the incentive compensation provisions apply by their terms to all banking organizations with $1 billion or more in assets. The banking agencies have done their best to tailor the application of these rules to smaller banks and, indeed, to make clear the limited extent to which they should affect those banks. However, some compliance effort on these rules is still needed at community banks. Raising the asset threshold for these two requirements to $10 billion would eliminate this compliance burden, the cost of which is probably not worth whatever incremental prudential benefits might be gained at these small banks. Even in the relatively unusual circumstance in which a practice at a smaller bank might raise safety and soundness concerns, the supervisory process would remain available to rectify any problems. The second threshold that is worth discussing is the $50 billion level established by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act. As noted earlier, the import of this threshold is to require enhanced prudential standards and supervisory stress testing for banking organizations whose assets exceed that amount. As also noted, the Federal Reserve has tailored those standards in accordance with the increasing stringency requirement of section 165, so that they are more flexible for institutions closer to the $50 billion threshold and most demanding for the eight firms of global systemic importance. It has been somewhat more difficult to customize supervisory stress testing. While some elements of the test, such as the market shock and single-counterparty default scenarios, are applied only to larger firms, the basic requirements for the aggregation and reporting of data conforming to our supervisory model and for firms to run our scenarios through their own models do entail substantial expenditures of out-of-pocket and human resources. This can be a considerable challenge for a $60 billion or $70 billion bank. On the other side of the ledger, while we do derive some supervisory benefits from inclusion of these banks toward the lower end of the range in the supervisory stress tests, those benefits are relatively modest, and we believe we could probably realize them through other supervisory means. These are the factors that lay behind my suggestion last year that it might be worth thinking about the level of this threshold, which I understand to be a purpose of today’s hearing. That said, I want to emphasize a few points. First, consideration of potential increases in the threshold for mandatory prudential measures should not remove the discretion of the banking agencies to require additional measures – including such things as more capital or liquidity – for specific firms or groups of firms in appropriate circumstances. That is, while it is sensible to limit mandatory measures for classes of firms where most banks in that class are unlikely to present a particular kind of risk, it would be very ill-advised to preclude supervisors from requiring such measures of firms where that risk may become more of a concern. Second, any consideration of raising the threshold to take account of the factors I mentioned earlier should not extend to removal of the application of enhanced standards and other rules to the largest banking organizations. As senators and regulators have discussed many times before in this committee, the tasks of combatting the reality and the perception of too big to fail, and of vulnerabilities in broader financial markets, are crucial and ongoing. Conclusion The innovation in the Dodd-Frank Act that requires tiered regulation is central to our shared goals of protecting financial stability and ensuring the availability of credit. Smaller banks do not pose risks to financial stability, though they can suffer collateral damage when stress builds throughout the financial system. And, while enhanced prudential standards are important to ensure that larger banks can continue to provide credit even in periods of stress, some of those same enhancements could actually inhibit credit extension by rendering the reasonable business models of middle-sized and smaller banks unprofitable. The Federal Reserve will continue to use statutory authorities to calibrate our regulation and supervision to the risks posed by the different classes of banks, avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach. We 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  and, I believe, many others are committed to the dual goals of protecting systemic stability and fostering the efficient intermediation of credit by the overwhelming majority of American banks that do not pose systemic or far-reaching risks. Thank you. I would be pleased to take any questions you may have. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: What can capital markets deliver? Speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the ILF (Institute for Law and Finance) Conference on “The European Capital Markets Union, a viable concept and a real goal?”, Frankfurt am Main, 18 March 2015. *      *      * 1.  Introduction Ladies and gentlemen Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at this year’s ILF conference. The topics of this conference are very well chosen, and I am therefore grateful for the opportunity to speak at today’s event and to share my thoughts on the European capital markets union. But let’s begin by taking a step back. As some of you will know, I spent ten years of my life working for JP Morgan. The legend goes that one day, old John Pierpont Morgan was approached by a young man who asked about the secret of the stock market. John Pierpont Morgan looked at the young man and replied: “it fluctuates”. In my view, that is an important thing to know about the inner nature of capital markets, but it is certainly not all there is to know. My short intervention today will therefore address a different question: what can capital markets deliver? Given the current discussions about a European capital markets union, it seems that we expect quite a lot from capital markets. Let’s take a closer look and discuss whether these expectations are justified. 2.  Diversification – strengthening capital markets In essence, the European capital markets union has two objectives. The first objective is to increase the share of capital markets in the funding mix of the real economy. The second objective is to integrate capital markets more closely across borders. Some people relate the first objective to the question of whether a capital markets-based financial system is superior to a bank-based financial system. Well, to sum up the empirical evidence: it is impossible to tell. There is certainly some evidence indicating that capital markets-based financing might increase pro-cyclicality.1 Nevertheless, the recent crisis shed light on these issues from another angle. A system in which the real economy relies on a single source of funding will most certainly run into trouble when that source dries up – regardless of whether it is bank funding or capital market funding. Therefore, it is not a question of “either/or”. The objective of the European capital markets union is not to abandon bank-based funding but to supplement it with capital markets-based funding. And in Europe above all places there is ample room to do so. The European stock market is only 60% the size of the US stock market when measured in relation to GDP.                                                 1  Adrian, T; Shin, H S (2010), Liquidity and Leverage.

   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Likewise, the European market for venture capital is 20% the size of the US market, and for securitisation the percentage is even lower.2 In the end, it comes down to the uncontested argument of diversification. Increasing the share of capital markets will improve and broaden access to funding particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, it will improve the matching of investors to financial risk, thereby increasing the efficiency of the financial system. As a result, the financial system will be able to better support sustainable economic growth. 3.  Integration – forming a single capital market The second objective of the European capital markets union is to improve the integration of capital markets in the entire European Union. What is it that integrated capital markets can deliver? One of the main arguments is that they can improve private risk sharing. The technical question is: to what degree does a shock to the economy affect consumption? Empirical studies for the United States show that integrated capital markets cushion around 40% of the cyclical fluctuations among the US federal states. A share of around 25% is smoothed via the credit markets, while fiscal policy cushions 10–20% of shocks. Altogether, around 80% of a given economic shock is absorbed before it can affect consumption3 Studies for Canada yield similar results.4  In Europe, the picture looks different. Here, it is mainly credit markets that cushion economic shocks – and they are not very effective in doing so. Altogether, only around 40% of a given shock is absorbed before it can affect consumption.5 Increasing the share of capital markets and integrating them across borders would therefore help improve risk sharing in Europe and reduce the volatility of consumption. 4.  How to get there Increasing the share of capital markets in the funding mix of the real economy can contribute to economic growth. At the same time, integrating capital markets across borders can help improve private risk sharing within Europe. The Bundesbank therefore believes that the European capital markets union is a goal worth pursuing. But how do we get there? The argument for a capital markets union is straightforward, while its implementation is much less so. The capital markets union is a complex undertaking that touches upon many different areas. Consequently, the European Commission’s green paper on this subject6 includes a wide variety of suggestions and steps to be taken. With regard to the objective of increasing the share of capital markets, we should focus on equity markets. Against this backdrop, let me emphasise the issue of taxes. Currently, tax treatment still favours debt financing over equity financing. Removing this bias in taxation would encourage companies to strengthen their equity base and thus turn more towards equity capital markets in their search for sources of funds.                                                 2  Bank of England (2015), A European Capital Markets Union: Implications for Growth and Stability.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In terms of the objective of integrating capital markets across Europe, there are some areas where standardisation could give us some early gains. The market for high-quality securitisation is one of these areas. So far, a number of policy initiatives have been launched to restart European securitisation markets, including an initiative by the European Commission to develop a framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation. Other areas for early action include private placements, crowd-funding or the harmonisation of prospectuses. With a view to the long-run, it might also be beneficial to further the development of funded pensions in order to enlarge and deepen European capital markets. Another long-term objective could be to harmonise insolvency laws across Europe. In any case, we should not exclusively focus on the institutional and legal framework in our efforts to create a European capital markets union. There might also be soft factors at play, such as cultural preferences for certain forms of funding or the level of financial education. We also should address these issues in order to achieve our objective. 5.  Conclusion Ultimately, the path towards a European capital markets union will be long and arduous. There will certainly be resistance, and there will be difficulties. Therefore, we should remain realistic about what can be achieved. Nevertheless, we embarked on the path of financial integration by adopting a single currency in 1999. And we must not stop there but deepen integration in order to make the European monetary union work. In November 2014, we took a major step by establishing a single European mechanism for banking supervision; now, we should consider taking another key step by forming a European capital markets union – one that not only includes the euro area but extends to the entire European Union. I would therefore like to conclude with a quote that is attributed to Robert Kennedy, although he allegedly borrowed it from his brother John F Kennedy, who – according to his advisor Ted Sorensen – borrowed it from someone else. In any case, the quote goes like this: “Some see things as they are and say “why?”. Others dream of things that never were and say “why not?”. With regard to the European capital markets union, I suggest we should join the latter group. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Claudia Buch: Finance and growth – guidelines for financial sector reform Speech by Prof Claudia Buch, Deputy President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Frankfurt Finance Summit 2015: “The Last Word”, Frankfurt am Main, 17 March 2015. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen It is my pleasure to share a few thoughts with you at the end of this year’s Frankfurt Finance Summit. Given the challenges that lie ahead, the Summit’s key question: “How to foster growth in a new regulatory framework?” could not be more timely. At the moment, economies worldwide are still struggling with the adverse effects of the financial crisis. The average loss of potential output resulting from the financial crisis has been estimated at 8.4%. And these output effects can be very persistent. Crises reduce an economy’s capital stock – and the catch-up process via investment takes time. Constrained credit supply in times of financial crisis can lead to inefficient capital allocation. Investment in innovations is postponed.This shrinks potential output and productivity, thereby slowing down long-run growth. In order to weaken the negative effects of financial crises on growth, many new regulations have been designed. In Europe, the Banking Union and, more recently, the Capital Markets Union feature prominently. At an international level, the regulation of globally significant financial institutions has been at the core. Overall, these reforms are headed in the right direction. Yet concerns are being raised that the regulatory system is becoming too complex and thus less transparent. This makes it necessary to focus on the key principles of regulatory reform. In the next 15 minutes, I would like to step back and ask • What is the relationship between finance and economic growth? • And is there a “double dividend” in the sense that financial systems which are conducive to growth are also more stable? To answer these questions, we can draw on a large body of empirical (and theoretical) evidence that can give us guidance for financial sector reform. Let me start with the evidence we have on the link between financial development and growth. 1.  Financial development and growth In the 1990s, there was a widespread consensus that financial development fosters economic growth. Developed financial sectors stimulate entrepreneurship, innovation, investment, and productivity. Many of these beneficial features of financial markets arise through equity finance. Through venture capital finance, for instance, new start-ups obtain not only financial resources but also management expertise. Yet, in much of the academic and policy debates, “financial development” has been associated with the share of credit intermediated through the banking system. And empirical research in fact supported the view that countries with larger banking systems also grow faster. However, the financial crisis raised a critical question. Is there a turning point after which additional financial sector growth no longer spurs, but perhaps even hinders economic growth? Or put differently: is more bank credit a bit like water in that there can be too much of a good thing? Water is certainly needed for life, but when there is too much water, there can also be a fatal water overdose which can lead to water intoxication. And if the financial 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  sector can grow beyond the limit that is good for economic health, what are the implications for the reform agenda? Recent empirical evidence indeed shows that the link between finance and growth is non-linear. In middle-income countries, financial sector development has positive effects on economic growth. In high-income countries, additional growth in the financial sector may even have negative effects on growth. Hence, there is no “optimal” size of the financial sector. This is important for us as policymakers. It shows that we should aim at providing the right institutional framework and incentives for the financial sector. The goal should be to prevent excessive leverage and risk taking. But before discussing regulatory implications, let me shed some light on the mechanisms that are at work. In 2009, Paul Krugman coined the term “boring banking” to describe banks focusing on their core business – taking household deposits and being conservative in giving out corporate loans. Banks fulfilled their role of financing entrepreneurship and firm entry, leading to positive firm dynamics and innovation. This raises the question why, at some point, the banking sector fails to support economic growth. A first explanation is related to the structure of banks’ activities. In banking sectors that grow fast, business tends to shift towards non-interest income generating activities. Banks tend to rely on wholesale instead of deposit funding. Banks no longer fulfil their traditional role of taking deposits and providing credit to the real economy. When market sentiment shifts, banks with a high share of wholesale funding are affected most and have to cut back credit to a greater extent. A second explanation distinguishes between household and corporate credit. In general, corporate credit is more closely aligned with the financing of investment and innovation. Yet, as countries develop and reach the productivity frontier, it becomes more difficult to stimulate growth further. Often, bank credit then shifts from the corporate to the household sector, with negative implications for growth. A third explanation is based on the structure of employment in the financial sector. In the US, the financial sector was a relatively high-skill and high-wage industry at the beginning of the 20th century as well as in the past 30 years. In the interim period, thefinancial sector lost its high human capital position and its wage premium relative to the rest of the private sector. This raises the question whether a highly developed financial sector attracts high-skilled labour – and whether such labour might be employed more efficiently in other sectors of the economy. All these factors – changes in the structure of bank funding, in bank assets, and in the skill composition of bankers – help explain why the financial sector may at some point become detached from the real economy. These explanations would remain incomplete, however, without stressing the role of regulations and the role of the public safety net. Regulations which encourage high leverage and public sector safety nets that subsidise risk taking leave the financial sector vulnerable to shocks. Systemic financial crises, which impose large costs on society, are the result. In short: financial systems that are built on equity rather than debt are inherently more stable. A related question is: which balance between bank-based and market-based finance is most conducive to growth? This question is not new. In the early 1990s, for instance, the Eastern European countries had to decide whether to opt for a bank-based or a market-based financial system. Both systems indeed have advantages, depending on the stage of economic development and the stage of the business cycle. As countries develop, the growth-enhancing effects of banking sector development decreases while the beneficial effects of capital markets become more important. As for individual firms, there is a “pecking order of finance”: at early stages of development, internal funds and external working capital loans dominate. As firms (or markets) mature, external 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  funds raised through bond and equity markets become more important. Also, while market-based systems help alleviating recessions after financial crises, bank-based systems are more effective in smoothing the impact of “normal” business cycle fluctuations. 2.  Financial structure and financial stability The structure of finance is important not only when discussing the implications of finance for growth. Rather, the structure of finance also has important implications for the stability of the financial system. The higher the share of debt finance, the larger “financial accelerator” effects can be – seemingly small shocks can have large and systemic implications. Economic fluctuations magnify and threaten the stability of the entire financial system. The channel of transmission can run through consumption or investment. • High levels of household debt affect output stability through the adjustment of consumption. Evidence for the US shows that households with high levels of real estate debt cut back consumption in response to shocks to asset prices, thus amplifying the cycle. • Firms with high levels of debt cannot smooth investment when an adverse shock hits. • High levels of public sector debt can be destabilising. As well Government spending cannot cushion the effects of financial crises when public debt levels are already too high. These effects are further magnified if households, firms, and governments have borrowed from a banking sector which is insufficiently capitalised. Adverse shocks then set into motion a downward spirals of asset valuations and prices that ultimately threaten the solvency of financial institutions. The destabilising effects of debt arise from its contractual features. Standard debt contracts are insensitive to the borrower’s situation. After risks have materialised an adjustment to shocks can occur only through new lending or through haircuts on existing loans. In contrast, the value of equity adjusts if the situation of the borrower changes so that equity provides a risk sharing mechanism. In other words, equity as a claim on real assets has stabilising features compared to debt as a claim on nominal assets. The stabilising features of equity contracts have also been visible during the European debt crisis. In Europe, debt finance has been more prone to capital flight than equity finance. Furthermore, diversified cross-border equity holdings help detach consumption from business cycle fluctuations. Cross-border equity allows more effective cross-border risk sharing and consumption smoothing. Increased reliance on equity finance would be particularly beneficial in the European Monetary Union, where exchange rates cannot adjust to cope with regional macroeconomic shocks. 3.  What are the policy implications? Financial systems which rely more on equity rather than debt finance can be conducive to growth, and they tend to be more resilient to shocks. This suggests that there might indeed be a “double dividend” – financial sector reforms that contribute to financial stability also promote growth. Viewed in this light, there are a couple of takeaways for policymakers and regulators. The first is that a more developed financial system is the basis for economic growth. However, our reform efforts should not be aimed at the mere size and growth of the financial sector. Instead, we must ensure that the financial sector fulfils its intermediation role and processes information efficiently. Microprudential regulations that improve banks’ risk assessment and ensure the application of common rules are crucial in this regard. The 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Banking Union is a key step forward, because it specifically aims at establishing common supervisory standards in Europe. Second, macroprudential policy is a necessary complement to microprudential regulation. There might be risks to the stability of the entire financial system that microprudential supervision cannot detect. For instance, increasing household debt might threaten stability through its impact on consumption – while individual banks may remain sound. Third, post-crisis private sector deleveraging was much lower in the euro area than in the US. This could partly explain the slower economic recovery in Europe. Reducing debt to levels which do not threaten stability requires efficient mechanisms to deal with distressed financial institutions. Bank recovery and resolution regimes provide important tools to restructure banks’ balance sheets. This is where the second pillar of the Banking Union – the Single Resolution Mechanism – plays a key role. Through the bail-in tool it facilitates, most importantly, increased private sector risk sharing. Fourth, the Banking Union needs to be complemented by reforms that strengthen the development and integration of equity markets. The Capital Markets Union offers a great opportunity. Many initiatives that are currently being discussed aim at integrating European markets for debt instruments, such as securitisations or covered bonds. The Capital Markets Union can indeed contribute to an improved functioning of debt markets. To facilitate debt restructuring, reforms of insolvency regimes are needed in some countries. The goal should be to allow for quick recovery or liquidation in a predictable and transparent manner. Yet, the Capital Markets Union ought to put more emphasis on the development and integration of European equity markets. Improving access to venture capital, and the sharing of information on local markets can be important in this regard. The Capital Markets Union should also be taken as an opportunity to remove the preferential tax treatment of debt versus equity. These measures would strengthen banks’ and firms’ loss-absorbing equity buffers and stabilise growth in Europe. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Celebrating freedom and responsibility Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the 117th Anniversary of Philippine Independence, Guam, 26 June 2015. *      *      * I am deeply honored to be with you here in Guam to celebrate the 117th Anniversary of the Independence of the Philippines. This is a time of reflection. A time when we look back to honor the people who dedicated their lives to secure our freedom as a nation. A time to remember the significant events that define us as a people and as a nation. Indeed, we must celebrate, commemorate, and value our heroes and their legacy of freedom. We are happy to note that this is well recognized by the Government of Guam with the proclamation signed by Gov. Calvo declaring June 2015 as Philippine Independence month. This brings me to the subject I wish to share with you tonight. In the Philippines, we are working on developing an economy where growth is sustained, balanced and one that promotes inclusive growth. Growth that improves the quality of life. Growth that empowers. Growth that breeds financial independence among our people - similar to what you have here in Guam. Indeed, with the freedom to set our own course, the Philippines is on track to achieve sustained long-term growth. Among others, we have registered 16 years of uninterrupted economic growth. And time and again, the Philippines has demonstrated a level of resilience that can withstand the effects of global financial distress or the devastating impact of natural calamities. In 2013, for instance, central Philippines was struck in succession by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake and by Typhoon Haiyan, considered the most powerful storm to make landfall in recorded history. Thousands died, millions were adversely affected, properties and infrastructure were destroyed and heritage sites ruined. Nevertheless, with overwhelming outpouring of international support, including from Guam, and with growth momentum on our side, our economy still expanded by 7.2%, the second highest in Asia, next to China. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas – which is the Philippine central bank - plays a crucial role in laying the appropriate foundation to help keep our economy growing. In line with our mandate, the Bangko Sentral works on providing an operating environment where stability is the hallmark of price movements and the financial system. The objective is to create conditions that are conducive to a balanced and sustainable growth of the economy. Promoting macroeconomic stability is crucial because it serves as a solid springboard for households and businesses to flourish. As US President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declared in his State of the Union address in 1944, and I quote: “True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.” Indeed, ensuring economic stability and security is in the best interest of a nation. I am pleased to report therefore that we continue to register solid gains in providing a stable environment for our economy to grow and for our people to benefit from opportunities that development brings. Among others, Philippine inflation in May was 1.6%, our lowest in 20 years. At this rate, we are able to preserve and protect the purchasing power of our people. By comparison, our inflation reached its highest at 50% in 1984 or three decades ago, when problems related to politics and economics converged. We had a debt crisis: with our gross international reserves insufficient to meet our overseas obligations, we declared a moratorium on foreign debt payments, which in turn triggered a credit freeze. As a consequence, government had 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  to ration scarce foreign exchange by prioritizing importation of critical commodities such as oil, medicines, and dairy products. The credit squeeze also pushed domestic interest rates higher, with housing loans going for over 30%. It was during this period when many Filipinos went overseas to find better opportunities. Today, things are so much better in the Philippines. We now have ample international reserves that have enabled us to fully prepay our loans to the International Monetary Fund, after 45 years of indebtedness. And we have liberalized foreign exchange transactions. Among others, with minimal documentation, individuals can purchase as much as one hundred twenty thousand dollars ($120,000.00) per transaction from banks. Interest rates have also been lower, with some housing loans going for 5% per year. The banking system is sound, stable and liquid, with bank capitalization more than compliant with global standards. In fact, last year, in a field of 69 jurisdictions, the Philippine banking system earned the distinction of receiving the only positive outlook rating from Moody’s. Moving forward, we are confident that our banks can hold their own when ASEAN Banking Integration takes place by 2020, as part of the wider implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015. In preparation for this, a new law was passed last year - Republic Act No. 10641 – allowing 100% foreign ownership of banks in the Philippines. We believe this will encourage healthy competition that will benefit Filipino consumers in terms of having broader and better choices of bank products and services. It will also bring in more foreign investments into the Philippine economy. We hope that these favorable business conditions in the Philippines will prove attractive for increased investments from Guamanians to partner with us in exploiting such opportunities. Parallel to this, we are taking a proactive approach to ensure that Filipinos across the country are able to identify, gain and prosper from the fruits of economic progress. Our way forward is through financial inclusion. We want our people to save, invest and learn proper personal finance management to be financially secure and independent. We want our people to be part of the financial mainstream where they can access bank loans that will help them grow their own business. We want our people to have options other than informal lenders with prohibitive rates and onerous conditions. And we want our people to be able to protect themselves against scams and to know their rights as financial consumers. We are therefore working with other agencies and institutions to develop and implement a national strategy for Financial Inclusion to achieve sustained and broad-based inclusive growth. The upward trajectory of economic freedom in the Philippines is reflected in the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom published by the Wall Street Journal and The Heritage Foundation where we ranked as 76th freest among 186 countries. We had one of the 10 best score improvements in this 2015 Index, with notable improvements in financial freedom, freedom from corruption, and labor freedom. While the report pointed out areas of remaining concern, it acknowledged that wide-ranging reforms have put greater emphasis on improving regulatory efficiency, enhancing regional competitiveness, and liberalizing the banking sector. In terms of overall economic freedom, the score of the Philippines is above average, relative to the world and the regional benchmarks. Ladies and gentlemen, the declaration of Philippine independence 117 years ago was a decisive step toward building a free and prosperous nation. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Today, more than paying respect to our forefathers and heroes, let us reflect, as beneficiaries of this freedom on our responsibilities in moving our country and our people forward wherever we may be. The current generation has the obligation to carry on with the task of nation-building to ensure that future generations continue to have the rights and privileges that we enjoy today as free and independent citizens as Filipinos or as Guamanians. At the core of this shared mission is the spirit of community that we also celebrate tonight-the Filipino values of bayanihan and malasakit - both of which are underpinned by concern and caring for others, out of compassion, or a sense of duty. We observe this, for instance, in the consistent flow of remittances from Guam to the Philippines. According to data collated by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, cash remittances through banks by overseas Filipinos in Guam reached a total of $85 million in 2013 and $87 million in 2014. The strong ties that bind us are also evident in the number of tourists from Guam who visit the Philippines. In 2014 for instance, we recorded 38,000 tourists from Guam - equivalent to roughly 23% of your population. And preference for products from the Philippines is on the rise. This includes dried mangos, shrimps and other food items and automotive vehicles. Philippine exports to Guam reached $13 million in 2013 and increased to $19 million in 2014. This is not surprising. Guam and the Philippines have many things in common – being a former colony of Spain and the United States and under Japan during World War II.  Indeed, Guam is part of our history. Filipino revolutionary heroes were exiled here. This included Melchora Aquino who was 84 when the Philippine revolution against Spanish rule broke out. Popularly named as “Tandang Sora” she provided shelter and resources to freedom fighters and became known as the Mother of the Philippine Revolution. The other Filipino hero exiled here was Apolinario Mabini who was recognized as the Brains of the Philippine Revolution. He was the first Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government and the first Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Republic of the Philippines. He was 38 when he died, shortly after returning from exile. Indeed, no one is too young nor too old, to fight for freedom. As fate would have it, we recently celebrated milestones of these two heroes: Melchora Aquino’s 200th birth anniversary in 2012, and Apolinario Mabini’s 150th birth anniversary in 2014. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas minted special coins and medals to commemorate the role of these two heroes in our fight to gain independence for our country and our people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are donating a number of these commemorative coins and medals to the Filipino Community of Guam and to the Philippine consulate here as a reminder of how Guam figured in the lives of these two heroes. And now, Filipinos come to Guam, not as exiles but as citizens of the world, who exercise their freedom to choose where they can be productive members of the economy and live better lives with their families. I understand that the number of tourists from the Philippines is also on the rise, as we have been learning good things about Guam and Guamanians. In other words, the Filipinos here have been actively promoting Guam in our country. I therefore congratulate the Filipino Community of Guam (FCG) in fostering and nurturing Philippine-Guam relations. And most especially, I commend FCG for being responsible members of the community here for over 60 years now. I understand FCG channels its efforts and resources to respond to emerging needs in health care, education, as well as in disaster relief and mitigation. This is 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  as it should be – paying back to the island of Guam, which, for many of you, has become your new home. I believe the members of FCG have made the right choice. Guam is economically active and has a bright future ahead of it. Among others, Guam is an exciting and popular destination for tourists who number over a million. In short, tourists easily outnumber the local population (est. at over 165,000). And projections of more active US military presence is bound to create more jobs and better opportunities here. I take this opportunity therefore to congratulate the leaders of Guam who are here tonight, for providing a clear roadmap to sustaining growth and a better life for Guamanians and its other residents. Ladies and gentlemen, the task of nation-building begins when we gain our freedom, our independence. This privilege comes with an obligation to nurture our freedom by working together to create better lives for our people. As French writer and philosopher Albert Camus once said: “Freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better.” Once again, I congratulate the members and officers, the Board of Directors, and the Board of Trustees of the Filipino Community of Guam under the leadership of President Baldovino for this successful celebration. Maraming Salamat! To my Kabalens, dacal a salamat! Thank you for your invitation and your kind attention. Mabuhay! Hafa Adai. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yves Mersch: On European unity – economic and institutional challenges facing Europe Speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, discussant Prof. Hannah Scobie, Chairman, European Economics & Financial Centre, European Economics & Financial Centre, London, 25 June 2015. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, David Laidler, the English economist and one of the foremost scholars of monetarism, once stated that “transparency is an asset that depreciates very rapidly, so communication has to be ongoing, and if it is to enhance accountability, it must be a two-way process as well”. As a central banker, I fully concur with this assessment. To explain our monetary policy measures – and to defend them when challenged – has become the state of the art in contemporary central banking communication. The exchange with academia, financial market participants and the general public is the litmus test for how we succeed in managing expectations. This holds in particular for times of heightened uncertainty and complexity. That is why I consider seminars like this one an important part of my professional duty – it provides an opportunity to explain the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB), to answer your questions and also to ask some questions of you, in order to benefit from your wealth of experience. The euro area in particular has faced many questions since its inception and – as one of the foremost euro area institutions – the ECB has increasingly been drawn into debates that go beyond a very narrow definition of monetary policy. As a result, a criticism that is sometimes levelled at us is that we spend too much time talking about policies which are outside our mandate – namely structural reforms and euro area governance – and too little time focusing on actually delivering that mandate, i.e. returning inflation from its current low levels back towards below, but close to 2%. You will not be surprised that I do not share this view. But the fact that it persists in some quarters suggests that there is a need to explain our position more clearly. Namely, to underline why the ECB has acted in the way it has in response to low inflation, and why we have insisted on others acting in their domains of responsibility as well, both at national level and European levels. This is what I would like to do in my remarks today. There are three points in particular that I would like to address. Implementing large-scale asset purchases The first point relates to our monetary policy and our decision to enter into our APP in January. While in some quarters this was seen as excessive activism, in others – often on this side of the Channel – it was seen as excessively hesitant. The argument was that as a price stability-oriented central bank with a symmetric mandate, we should have followed other major central banks and deployed asset purchases sooner to push inflation back to our objective. If one looks at the steps we have taken based on the data available in each period, it becomes clear that we acted based on an evolving medium-term outlook and taking into account the balance of risks at each moment – as any responsible policymaker should. The process in 2014 that led to the launch of our APP illustrates well this point. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  At the start of 2014 we were confronted, on the one hand, with a consistent and broad-based downward trend in past inflation, falling from 3% at the end of 2011 to less than 1% at the beginning of 2014. But on the other, sentiment on the economic outlook was relatively positive for the year, with nearly all forecasters expecting the recovery to strengthen as the year progressed. In this context, we felt relatively comfortable that the medium-term inflation outlook was secure. While we were very alert to the risks to that outlook, there was no clear justification for a strong expansion of the monetary policy stance at that time. Moreover, the use of large-scale asset purchases was unprecedented in the euro area and came with concerns that do not exist in other advanced economies. There was more uncertainty about the strength of the relative transmission channels given the euro area’s financial structures; and there was more concern about the possible side-effects and redistributive effects of holding large amounts of government bonds in a monetary union that is not a fiscal union. All this created a further reason to be patient. In my view, deploying asset purchases had to be an ultima ratio decision. We had to see clear evidence of heightened deflationary risks either in the realised inflation data or in the movements of inflation expectations. That evidence started to appear in the summer of 2014 as the macroeconomic situation worsened unexpectedly and the underlying impetus that we saw earlier in the year faded. This removed an important driver behind the reflation scenario we had expected. The sharp fall-off in oil prices that began in the late summer added then further disinflationary pressures, feeding also into core inflation. The result was that, by January 2015, the euro area was experiencing negative headline inflation rates. Crucially, there were also material signs that inflation expectations were becoming unanchored, which increased the likelihood that inflation would stay below our objective even when the oil price effect faded. These data, especially measures of inflation expectations, were sufficiently decisive to warrant our shift to large-scale asset purchases in January this year. The prevailing macroeconomic outlook meant that the benefits of deploying that instrument in terms of delivering our mandate now clearly outweighed the costs in terms of potential side effects. But by waiting for adequate evidence, had we ended up “behind the curve” in counteracting the disinflationary trend? In my view the answer is clearly no. First, we had taken a series of expansionary measures throughout 2014 in response to the incoming data, including cutting our main refinancing rate to its effective lower bound; introducing a negative rate on our deposit facility; launching our targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs); and, importantly, in September 2014, with our decision to begin purchases of ABS and covered bonds. Second, by communicating clearly the conditions under which we would use large-scale asset purchases – our so-called reaction function – we had already initiated a gradual easing of financial conditions as markets anticipated our measures. Long-term nominal interest rates fell by around 100 bps from mid-2014 to January 2015. Because we were predictable and credible, our policy was taking effect before it was actually announced in January. Third, even though our measures were partly priced-in, when they were launched the initial impact was stronger than many expected and the response of macroeconomic indicators was quicker. We have seen strong signalling effects, reflected in rising inflation expectations, a rebound in consumer and business confidence and higher equity prices. And we have also seen evidence of significant portfolio rebalancing effects, both across assets classes (i.e. towards more risky assets) and across jurisdictions, producing a fall in the effective exchange rate. As a result, the economic recovery has broadened and the June ECB staff projections now envisage inflation to average at 0.3% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. Our actions have proven timely and provide us, so far, with comfort that the medium-term inflation outlook is secure. Both output and inflation forecasts are broadly balanced. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  These forecasts are however contingent upon a full implementation of our programme. We intend to carry out our public sector purchases until end-September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. Only once we see convincing evidence that inflation has returned sustainably to levels in line with our objective will we be able to declare success. Monetary policy and structural reforms But this begs the question: if our measures are working well, why do we put so much focus on other policies? This is the second point that I would like to address – why structural reforms are relevant for monetary policy and why it is legitimate that, as a central bank, we take a view on them. In a nutshell, in the euro area, the more divergent economies become in terms of their structural conditions, the harder it ultimately becomes to achieve price stability at the euro area level. First, structural reforms have a direct link to inflation, inflation expectations and real interest rates through their effect on the adjustment process. When a country is hit by a shock, output will be less affected if relative prices can adjust quickly, and the recovery in output will be faster if the economy is able to reallocate resources in a more efficient way. This depends critically on structural features of the economy – for example, how labour markets adjust (i.e. the relative contributions of wage and employment adjustment), whether product markets are competitive and allow the entry and growth of new firms, and how quickly labour and capital can redeploy to more productive uses. This is related to issues such as the strength of insolvency regimes and effectiveness of active labour market policies. How adjustment takes place in turn has implications for euro area price stability. A fast price adjustment will cause inflation to fall steeply initially, but then agents will expect it to rise again. This ensures a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations and does not affect perceptions of real interest rates going forward. A slow employment adjustment, by contrast, will create more prolonged downward pressure on inflation, which is more likely to weigh on inflation expectations. This in turn can lead to higher expected real interest rates and exacerbates the effect of the shock, thus complicating the achievement of price stability at the euro area level. Second, structural factors can compound adjustment difficulties by affecting the transmission and effectiveness of monetary policy across different countries. That is because if economies recover very slowly from shocks, it is more likely to produce financial fragmentation and impair the transmission of monetary policy to those areas. For example, a prolonged downturn with higher unemployment will tend to create higher loan-losses for banks, which impairs the bank lending channel of transmission as banks are forced to rebuild their capital. Such an economic slump is also likely to worsen the fiscal position for the government, which can further exacerbate fragmentation via the bank-sovereign nexus. Moreover, even if transmission works smoothly on the supply side, structural reforms also affect the demand side: the willingness of entrepreneurs to take on credit for new investment. Insofar as structural factors create an unattractive investment environment, they can impede credit demand and thereby hamper the effectiveness of monetary policy. By the same token, structural reforms and accommodative monetary policy can be complementary in boosting investment. That would include, at the micro level, opening up protected sectors where there is pent-up investment demand or reducing administrative burdens on entrepreneurship; and at the macro level, lifting expectations of future growth and hence “animal spirits”, especially where firms are constrained by a debt overhang. This psychological dimension of reforms is particularly important for the euro area given that 5 years ahead growth expectations among forecasters have been falling continuously since 2001, from around 2.7% then to 1.4% today. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Third, if due to structural factors shocks leave deep scars on some economies, it can affect the long-term cohesion of the Union. Divergence in structural unemployment is more likely to become entrenched across the Union, which of course cannot be offset, like in other federations, by fiscal transfers between the constituent members. And to the extent that this weakens the political rationale for monetary union – that all members are better off over time inside the Union than they would be outside – it also weakens its long-term cohesion. This undermines the integrity of the currency union. The ECB’s interest in structural reforms therefore has two dimensions: achieving an efficient implementation of monetary policy in the short-term, and maintaining the integrity of the currency over the longer-term. Both of these feed into euro area price stability. However, our interest is not in how countries implement reforms. This is a national question and there are different models that can work in a monetary union. Our interest is in whether they succeed in doing so, as it is this that has implications for the whole euro area. It is in this context that we at the ECB have recently called for stronger common governance in this area. This call reflects the fact that some of the original expectations on how monetary union would function have, I think, now clearly been shown as over-optimistic. In particular, when the Maastricht Treaty was signed, it was evident to most policymakers that monetary union would ultimately need to be accompanied by integration in other policy areas too. But it was widely expected that, following the functionalist logic, sharing a single currency would automatically trigger that integration. We know this did not happen. And while the role of common institutions, rules and procedures has increased, the institutional equilibrium in the euro area is still fragile. Institutional responses to our economic challenges So my third point is that we need to reflect seriously on the key features of a well-functioning monetary union, and how we can progress towards establishing them. A lot of progress has already been made in strengthening our rules and institutional architecture. We have reinforced our fiscal rules and improved the coordination of our economic policies. And we have made a huge institutional leap with Banking Union, establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) within the ECB and a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). But we know that the architecture of EMU is not yet complete, and the 5 Presidents’ Report published this Monday describes how to take this process to the next level. Though like Rome a complete EMU cannot be built in a day, I believe we have to be ambitious both in the short and longer term. We have to show that we are building a bridge towards a more stable and prosperous union. This is what the report does. It fleshes out a number of quick-wins that can be implemented in a first stage without Treaty change. The Commission will come forward with concrete proposals on these still this year. And it sets the priorities for more fundamental changes to how monetary union operates in the future. The ECB fully supports this process and will continue to actively contribute to it. Let me highlight what we see as two crucial aspects of the report. First, the report makes a strong case for completing Banking Union. It calls for finding a swift agreement on bridge financing and a permanent backstop for the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRF), with the ESM identified as the natural institution to act as a backstop for the SRF, while remaining fiscally neutral. These measures would help further sever the bank-sovereign nexus, which would in turn complement the functioning of monetary union – by reinforcing the singleness of money within the euro area, and by supporting the even monetary policy transmission across jurisdictions. Second, the report advocates a long-term sovereignty shift in both economic and fiscal policies – a ‘move from rules to institutions’. Most importantly, the report calls for a new economic convergence process to make the euro area more resilient against shocks, which would in turn make further sharing of sovereignty in the fiscal domain possible. It also proposes eventually establishing a euro-area treasury to take decisions jointly on certain elements of national 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  budgets. This is certainly not for tomorrow, but this is the direction our Economic and Monetary Union ultimately needs to move in. In order to maintain the momentum, this process needs to start now. It is now up to the European leaders to reflect on these proposals and carry them forward. As a matter of fact, they are discussing the report at the European Council in their meeting tonight and tomorrow. I trust that the wider context will not be lost in those discussions. Conclusion Let me conclude. Our forceful monetary policy measures were first, necessary, second, timely, and, third, effective. The economic recovery is now proceeding at a moderate pace. And we see encouraging signs that it is broadening. Monetary policy accommodation is a necessary condition for the recovery to keep on track. This implies that we will deliver what we announced. But it is not a sufficient condition. Member states have to do their part. Structural reforms are needed to strengthen the supply side and help economies regain a competitive edge in a globalized economy. And only with such an increased growth potential will the cyclical recovery become a sustained, structural recovery. Neither monetary policy nor economic policy takes place in an institutional vacuum. The institutional refurbishment of the European house has so far achieved a lot. But the ambition to do so was often driven by the urgency of crisis. And now that the worst may lie behind us, we have to keep the momentum of further integration. The 5 Presidents’ report is a useful roadmap for the way ahead. A strong commitment to completing Banking Union will ease financing conditions for enterprises sustainably, and increase the resilience of Europe’s financial landscape with a view also to hemming in contagion. Likewise, a long-term sovereignty shift in both economic and fiscal policies will stimulate convergence towards similarly resilient economic structures, based on common standards. Not everything can be achieved today, but all countries agreeing on the same way forward is a key element for higher confidence and a lasting end to this crisis. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Thomas Jordan: The Swiss economy in a weakened world Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the General Meeting of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, Lausanne, 25 June 2015. The complete speech can be found in French and German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch).  *      *      * Since summer 2007, the global economy has been in a state of near-permanent crisis. What began as a subprime crisis triggered the banking and financial crisis, leading to a deep recession. This culminated in the European debt crisis. The current strength of the Swiss franc is a reflection of this global crisis, and highlights the franc's status as a safe haven, which is especially pronounced in times of high global uncertainty. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has responded to the appreciation pressure by taking exceptional measures. In terms of Switzerland's economic activity and the SNB's balance sheet, no other country has seen its monetary policy so highly exposed. The decision to discontinue the minimum exchange rate was prompted by renewed changes in international conditions, particularly the growing divergence between the monetary policy stances of the world's main currency blocks. Had the SNB delayed its decision, it would have lost control of monetary policy and would have had to discontinue the minimum exchange rate at a later date under much less favourable conditions. The end of the minimum exchange rate has major repercussions for the Swiss economy, and it was by no means an easy decision for the SNB. Yet this is not the first time that the Swiss economy has had to react to shocks and changes in the international environment, and the experience was often painful. The example of the watch industry shows that even a severe crisis can be overcome. Unfortunately, this example is not readily transferable to other export industries. Many companies currently find themselves compelled to seek cost reductions and efficiency gains. The economic outlook depends to a great extent on global economic developments. In its latest monetary policy assessment, the SNB is projecting that momentum in the global economy will pick up again. This should cushion the impact of the exchange rate shock somewhat, and allow Switzerland to return to positive growth in the second half of the year. While inflation has dropped well into negative territory, as things currently stand, a sustained price decline - or, indeed, a deflationary spiral - is not to be expected. Overall, the Swiss franc is currently significantly overvalued. Monetary policy is geared towards this challenging set of circumstances, and is guided by the SNB's willingness to take an active role in the foreign exchange market and apply negative interest rates. This two-pronged approach is designed to ease the upward pressure on the Swiss franc. However, in the current climate there is, regrettably, no easy solution that would absorb all external disruptions. We must accept these challenging economic conditions for the time being. The SNB is aware that many companies find themselves in a difficult situation. And it has great respect for the challenges facing Switzerland's businesses and their staff.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yves Mersch: Introductory statement on TARGET2-Securities (T2S) before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) Speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Public Hearing on TARGET2-Securities (T2S) before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) of the European Parliament, Brussels, 16 June 2015. *      *      * Mr Chairman, dear members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to be here today to discuss TARGET2-Securities, or T2S – the new securities settlement engine in Europe. The European Parliament has played an essential role in this project and strongly supported it from the beginning. We are only three days away from the first migration weekend, during which the first European markets will migrate their securities settlement business to the platform. T2S will be live as of 22 June. Over the next two years it will come more and more into life as a total of 21 markets migrate to the new single platform. T2S is the largest market infrastructure project undertaken by the Eurosytem to date. I would today like to emphasise the progress we have achieved on our journey from TARGET in 1999 to T2S today, and how this provides a good example for further integration in the context of the capital markets union. TARGET In 1999, with the launch of the euro, there was an immediate need for a large-value payment system that could process all payment flows related to monetary policy operations in euro. TARGET was launched on 1 January after only four years of development. Owing to the time constraints, it was not possible to develop a fully integrated system, but only to link the existing systems in Europe. In order to build a truly integrated system, the TARGET2 project was initiated and TARGET2 started operations in 2007. Today it is one of the largest payment systems in the world, reaching around 56,000 banks worldwide, in addition to the central banks of the EU. In 2014 over 90 million payments were settled, with a turnover of €492 trillion. The use of TARGET2 is mandatory for the settlement of all payment orders related to monetary policy operations in euro, and is therefore an essential component of our monetary policy execution. It has enabled us to create a single money market for the euro area, as all euro cash payments are settled in a streamlined way across Europe. TARGET2 is used for payments related to both monetary policy and other operations in the interbank market. However, the infrastructure for transferring financial assets for trading and collateral operations was left fragmented. While the cash side had reached a high level of integration, securities still had to be settled in over 30 different systems in Europe. T2S Discussions were therefore initiated with the market on how to integrate the securities landscape, especially in a financial market where securities are used more and more as collateral to generate liquidity. The idea was put forward that the Eurosystem could provide settlement services for securities transactions in central bank money. The European Parliament and Council were among the first to support this idea. Thanks to your 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  recommendation, the scope of T2S was extended and it has been built as a multicurrency system. The objective of T2S was to create an integrated infrastructure which would support capital markets on a European scale. Until now, the securities landscape in Europe has been characterised by numerous securities settlement systems, divergent laws governing securities depositories and different rules for post-trade processes. This is highly inefficient, increases risks and leads to a significant waste of resources. T2S has started a process that will change this completely. T2S will in fact bring numerous benefits, including the following. 1. Processing costs for cross-border transactions will decrease drastically. 2. It will foster safety and financial stability by settling securities directly in central bank money. 3. It will allow for economies of scale without requiring that securities depositories be merged. In the T2S model, securities depositories are the gateways through which market participants can access securities in T2S. Securities depositories will maintain all other functions such as their notary role, asset servicing and services for issuers. 4. Last but not least, T2S will facilitate collateral management for market participants as it will make it easy to transfer collateral across borders. This is a key feature because demand for collateral has increased since the financial crisis, owing to both market conditions and new regulation. T2S governance structure and the first migration wave I would like to spend a few moments on the governance structure of T2S as I believe that it is one of the reasons for the success of the project. If I were to show you the T2S governance chart, you would probably describe it using the word “complex”. I would tend to agree that a four-level governance structure with hundreds of institutions involved is complex. However, it has proven its effectiveness in resolving difficult matters in a swift and efficient manner, keeping in mind the common goal of ensuring the timely and successful launch of T2S. In the past few weeks the commitment of those forming the T2S governance structure has become apparent once more. You might have heard some rumours that the T2S platform was not stable enough to go live. However, the reality is that the platform has been declared stable and ready to go live both by the T2S Board in charge of steering the project and by the central securities depositories in the steering body (the T2S CSD Steering Group). We are conscious that T2S will have an immense impact on the financial market and it is of key importance for us that the migration goes smoothly. After assessing the status of the platform – its stability and readiness for production mode – I can assure you that it is ready for the migration and launch this coming weekend. However, going live requires more than just the Eurosystem being ready; we also need the migrating communities to be ready. The first T2S migration wave was to include five securities depositories and their communities: Bank of Greece Securities Settlement System (BOGS), Depozitarul Central (Romania), Malta Stock Exchange, Monte Titoli (Italy) and SIX SIS (Switzerland). Four out of those five markets, namely Greece, Malta, Romania and Switzerland, have confirmed their readiness to migrate as scheduled on 22 June 2015. As far as the Italian market is concerned, a solution has been put forward which has eased the strong discomfort that has recently been signalled by the Italian banks regarding migration on 22 June 2015. Following a formal request by Monte Titoli, the Italian securities depository, it and its community will be given an extended period of testing and will migrate only on 31 August 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  2015. This solution will not only help the Italian market, but will also ensure that difficulties in one market cannot spill over to other markets and have implications for the financial market as a whole. This proposal has been discussed within the governance structure and is supported by the remaining securities depositories joining T2S. A detailed activity plan is now being developed for the migration of the Italian market on 31 August 2015 and the possible impact on the scheduled activities for the subsequent migration waves is being assessed. This solution for the migration of the Italian market is due to be approved by the ECB’s Governing Council tomorrow. Harmonisation agenda, CSD Regulation and capital markets union Let me now turn to the other initiatives surrounding T2S, namely the harmonisation agenda, the CSD Regulation and the capital markets union project. In addition to the concrete benefits brought about by T2S, a push has been given to the European post-trade industry to harmonise market practice, rules and standards. This is a market-driven process that will enable T2S to realise its full potential, in terms of efficiency and achieving a level playing field. The market is in the driving seat, but the ECB strongly supports this initiative and provides the secretariat function. The objective is to create a single rulebook for post-trade processes, which will help contribute to financial integration in Europe. On the regulatory side, remarkable progress has also been made with the adoption of the CSD Regulation. This new piece of EU legislation complements the operational integration provided by T2S and gives further momentum to the post-trade harmonisation efforts. It has removed a number of the barriers to reaching a fully integrated market and is thus very much welcome. The next step forward will be the capital markets union (CMU), for which we have high expectations. If well designed and thoroughly implemented, CMU could bring significant benefits to the EU. T2S and the implementation of the CSD Regulation have already removed a number of the market infrastructure barriers. CMU has the potential to remove the remaining ones. Beyond market infrastructures, the aim of CMU should be to integrate financial markets in such a way that investors and issuers of financial instruments have equal access to these markets, under equal conditions. Similarly to the harmonisation agenda surrounding the development of T2S, CMU will require both market-led efforts towards greater harmonisation and legislative action to dismantle key cross-border barriers in a wide range of areas. This will help set the right framework conditions for these markets to develop and integrate. In fact, TARGET2 and T2S show that genuine integration, rather than mere coordination, is essential to have well-functioning markets which can fully play their role in supporting the economy. Thank you for your attention. I am now looking forward to our discussion. 
    BIS central bankers’ speeches 1   Luis M Linde: Brief comments on the interactions between monetary policy and macroeconomic adjustments Speech by Mr Luis M Linde, Governor of the Bank of Spain, at the XXXI Conferencia del Círculo de Economía, Sitges, 30 May 2015. *      *      * Let me first thank Antón Costas, President of Círculo de Economía, for his invitation to participate in this final session of the XXXI Conference, which is a classic on our schedule of economic meetings and conferences. Many thanks, too, to Andreu Mas-Colell for accompanying us in this session, where we are joined by the Vice President of the ECB, Vitor Constancio, to whom it will be an honour for me to give the floor immediately after my address. First, by way of introduction, I should like to make some brief comments on the interactions between monetary policy and macroeconomic adjustments, one of the major matters raised in the euro area monetary policy framework in recent years. Long periods of very low inflation pose risks to medium-term price stability, to economic activity and to financial stability. The first of these risks is the de-anchoring of inflation expectations from levels consistent with price stability which, as we know, the ECB defines as an expected inflation rate below but close to 2% in the medium term. Being in the proximity of a deflation dynamic may encourage the postponement of spending decisions by households and firms. Moreover, although nominal interest rates may be at very low levels, if inflation continues falling, real interest rates will trend upwards, contributing to reducing consumption and investment. Secondly, in economies posting a high level of public or private debt, or both, very high or rising real interest rates may exacerbate the difficulties of bringing about a reduction in household, corporate and public-sector debt, the reason being that the stock of debt, though it holds constant in nominal terms, will rise in real terms. The macro adjustment of a highly indebted economy in an environment of very low inflation or, indeed, deflation, thus becomes difficult and complex. And, thirdly, in relation to financial stability, the events we have seen in recent years indicate that asset price bubbles and the misallocation of financial resources may coexist alongside low inflation. If the situation of low inflation extends over time and draws close to deflation, we will arrive at very low or even negative interest rates, and that will entail additional risks for institutional investors, for the allocation of resources and for the sound functioning of the financial system. This was what we experienced in the euro area in the second half of last year. What role can monetary policy play in such a scenario? In September 2014, the ECB decided to expand the tools available to monetary policy by adding a private asset purchase programme followed, in January this year, by public-sector and public debt purchases. ECB policy interest rates were already then at their lower bound, at practically zero, with negative rates on the deposit facility. At the same time, liquidity provision by the ECB through its regular open market operations and its longer-term operations followed an on-demand principle, granting all the liquidity requested by banks; indeed, for several years a policy has been pursued under which, at the interest-rate marked for monetary policy operations, the ECB has not rationed the volume of liquidity provided to banks. After a few months’ experience, we can state that asset purchases have clearly contributed to re-anchoring inflation expectations, in line with the medium-term objective and, most importantly, they have checked and reversed the rise in real interest rates. Their effects have also been manifest in portfolio re-balancing, encouraging investors to shift holdings from risk-
    2 BIS central bankers’ speeches   free or very low-risk securities to riskier ones, thereby reducing the cost of financing for consumers and investors. The second aspect I would like to mention is the role of economic policies in countries that have had to set about correcting the deep-seated imbalances built up in the expansion that ended with the onset of the crisis in 2007–2008. I would refer to policies aimed at improving competitiveness in goods markets and at reducing labour market inefficiencies, which are most significant in countries with high unemployment, in particular in those cases in which high indebtness is a constraint on the possibility of implementing demand-boosting policies. Reforms are conducive to wage moderation and to the containment of the inflation rate, with the potential to initially dampen domestic demand owing to lower wages, the increase in the real value of debt and, in some cases, the increase in real interest rates. However, these initial adverse effects could be offset and, as experience shows, exceeded by gains in competitiveness, increases in exports and gains in confidence that positively affect consumption and investment decisions and generate employment and growth. Another matter to be highlighted is that of the synergies between structural reforms and monetary policy. The Spanish economy is a good example of a positive interaction and of the fact that, at least occasionally, reforms and policy are mutually reinforcing. After a period in the euro area with considerable stress combined with very marked segmentation in the credit markets, despite the ECB’s increasingly loose monetary policy, this interaction between structural reforms and a strongly expansionary monetary policy finally began to be felt in late 2013 and, naturally, in 2014, in any event in Spain. Unquestionably, some of the reforms launched in 2012–2013 contributed to relieving stress on the financial markets owing, above all, to their contribution to improving confidence. The improvement in public finances governance in the euro area no doubt played a key role in enhancing confidence. Naturally, we may well ask what happens under this scenario to those economies that have witnessed a loss in competitiveness compared with those countries that have implemented reforms, for example those affecting the labour market and those which have provided, along with other factors, for the so-called internal devaluation. In this case, the relative loss of competitiveness has been offset by the monetary policy stimulus and its impact on national demand and on the external sector. The depreciation of the euro accompanying this policy which has, no doubt, partly been one of its consequences, has improved the competitiveness of the area as a whole, stimulating exports and overall activity. Here we should recall that the euro area as a whole runs a most significant surplus on its transactions with non-euro countries. Both excessive deficits and large surpluses entail risks and costs. Accordingly, we believe there is justification behind the calls from several international institutions for those euro area countries that have the leeway to do so to implement policies conducive to the expansion of their domestic demand. I shall sum up with two ideas. First, that the de-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations entails serious risks to financial stability and growth, risks that may be exacerbated in countries that have to follow a process of macroeconomic adjustment and deleveraging. Second, that monetary policy and structural reforms, when simultaneously applied, may lead to highly positive synergies. And now a few words to make way for the address by my much-respected and dear friend Vitor Constancio. As well as having pursued a brilliant academic career, Vitor Constancio has been at the commanding heights of Portuguese politics and economic government. Constancio has been a Member of Parliament, Minister of Economy and Finance, Governor of the Banco de Portugal on two occasions, the second from 2000 to 2009, a member of the 
    BIS central bankers’ speeches 3   Council of State and a professor at various Portuguese university institutions. In 2010 he was appointed Vice President of the ECB. Given his position, and also in light of his personality and experience, Constancio plays a very important role in steering and designing the ECB’s policies. He is a representative of what I would define as “flexible orthodoxy”, i.e. a rigorous point of view on ECB’s tasks and priorities, but one which flees from rigidity and never forgets common sense when it comes to the complex and often difficult decisions, in both the technical and political sense, that the ECB has to adopt. I give the floor to Vitor Constancio.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Rodrigo Vergara: The Monetary Policy Report and the Financial Stability Report Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, before the Finance Commission of the Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 3 June 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found on the Central Bank of Chile's website. The Monetary Policy Report of June 2015 and the Financial Stability Report of the first half of 2015 can be found at http://www.bcentral.cl. Introduction Mr. President of the Finance Committee of the Senate, Senator Andrés Zaldívar, senators members of this Committee, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for inviting me to share the vision of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile on recent macroeconomic and financial developments, their prospects and implications for monetary and financial policy making. This vision is contained in detail in the Monetary Policy Report of June 2015 and the Financial Stability Report of the first half of 2015. The macroeconomic scenario shows minor changes with respect to forecasts in March. Annual inflation declined between February and April, but it remains above 4%. Output and demand continue to grow at a moderate pace, and the first quarter was better than expected, but incoming data suggest that the remainder of the year will be somewhat less dynamic than previously estimated. In the global economy, the growth outlook showed no major changes either. The weaker US figures early in the year and the consolidation of better prospects in Europe are worth mentioning. The dollar lost some of the strength it had gained during the first months of the year, while the market has pushed back its expectations regarding the beginning of the US monetary tightening process. Nevertheless, long-term rates rose in the US, as in most developed markets. The prices of most commodities rose, especially oil. In this context, the Board has held the monetary policy rate (MPR) at 3 percent, maintaining a significantly expansionary monetary policy stance. Let me now describe our baseline scenario and the main risks we have identified in the two reports I am presenting today. Macroeconomic scenario In recent months, core inflation (i.e. the CPIEFE, which excludes the prices of energy and foodstuffs) has brought no major surprises and its behavior continues to be largely determined by the effects of the peso depreciation and the usual indexation of the economy. However, annual CPI and CPIEFE inflation is still above 4% and, the same as in March, the baseline scenario of this Monetary Policy Report assumes that it will hover around 4% for some months. After the publication of the previous Report, private inflation expectations for this year increased in line with that Report and have remained at a higher level since then. At one to two years’ term, expectations remain at or around 3%, which is the target set by the Central Bank (figure 1). In the first quarter, domestic output and demand grew slightly more in annual terms than was expected in March. This was visible in private and public consumption, and in investment in construction and other works, with the resulting increase in growth in construction, trade and some services. However, March figures and incoming indicators suggest that the recovery of 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  growth in the remainder of the year will be somewhat slower than expected. This is reflected by several indicators, such as retail sales, imports of consumer goods and business and consumer expectations. Particularly worrisome is the possibility of consumer and business confidence remaining in clearly pessimistic territory, a situation that, if not reversed, will hinder the recovery of growth in the second half of the year (figure 3). The evolution of credit also reflects weak private spending. Annual growth of consumer and commercial loans is still bounded, despite the low interest rates. Job creation in the private sector has also been in line with the economic slowdown. Hiring in the most cycle-sensitive sectors, such as manufacturing and construction, post negative y-o-y rates of variation, which however have moderated in recent months. Nevertheless, the stronger increase in employment in agriculture and services, especially some linked to the public sector, has led total employment to grow by about 1% annually. The unemployment rate remains low, because the slower employment growth is matched by also slower growth in the labor force (figure 4). Nominal wages continue to grow strongly, slightly more than 7 percent. The empirical evidence suggests that this owes mainly to the indexation to higher past inflation. Although this phenomenon is not as intense as it was in past decades, it is still significant. There is still the risk, however, that if wages remain high, the convergence of inflation may take longer. Another risk is that the evolution of wages may be reflecting a narrowing of output gaps with respect to the baseline scenario and, therefore, increased inflationary pressures. World economic data have shown lower growth in the US and a strengthening of the more positive outlook in the Eurozone. Although the worsened US data for the first quarter are believed to be mostly temporary, as I said, the moment when the market expects the Fed to begin adjusting the policy rate has been postponed. Nevertheless, long-term interest rates have risen, although with some reversal in recent days, and the yield curve has steepened in the US and several other economies (figure 5). This phenomenon is partly related to the change in the macroeconomic outlook-the recovery process in the developed world and higher inflation-, but also to the decompression of the low term premiums associated with portfolio reallocations. Still, external financing conditions remain favorable by historic standards. In Chile, with ups and downs, the peso has appreciated in nominal and real terms. The peso/dollar parity is around 615 as of the closing of the Monetary Policy Report, and has risen further to a little over 620 pesos to the dollar since. This, after surpassing CLP 640 in March and standing near CLP 600 in May. At the same time, the real exchange rate (RER) has fallen from around 97 in February to a value near its last fifteen years’ average most recently (figure 6). Long-term nominal interest rates have fluctuated less than their external counterparts have. In the emerging economies, the growth outlook is not very different from the one foreseen a few months ago, confirming the slowdown in China. Latin America remains the region suffering the most profound and continuous deterioration, which is particularly intense in Brazil. Inflation remains low in a large part of the world, but not in Latin America where it is still high. Moreover, the prices of most commodities, although with fluctuations, are higher than those included in the March Report. Copper, after trading around US$2.9 per pound for a few days, moved closer to US$2.8 at the statistical cutoff date (although recently it has approached 2.7), while WTI oil is trading near $60 per barrel. This contrasts with the decline in food prices. I should note two important trends that are being observed in the world, implying greater convergence of growth. On one hand, while the US is expected to continue to grow faster than Europe, the gap between the two regions has been narrowing. On the other hand, emerging markets will continue to outgrow developed economies, but this gap is also closing. Turning to our estimates, the baseline scenario foresees that this year GDP will grow between 2.25% and 3.25%, a range that is somewhat lower than estimated in the last Report 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  (table 3). This projection considers that the floods in the north of the country and one-time effects on important mines reduce the mining growth estimate, with a downward incidence on the estimate for annual GDP growth of one tenth of one point compared with the March forecast. Meanwhile, since the partial data of recent months show weaker private expenditure, it is foreseen that the recovery that was expected for the second half will occur at a slower pace than was projected in March. The Business Perceptions Report of last May confirmed bounded expectations regarding the performance of businesses and investments in 2015. Moreover, the CBC’s survey continued to point to a fall in valued projects for this year compared with 2014 (table 1). On the external front, our projection assumes trading partners’ growth to drop by one tenth of a point in 2015 and 2016, to 3.3% and 3.7%, respectively. This adjustment responds largely to the reduced projection for the US. In the Eurozone, prospects remain unchanged because first quarter data brought no surprises other than some differences within the region. Growth is revised down for China and Latin America, because of actual first-quarter data and weaker prospects. As for the terms of trade, our estimate continues to assume an improvement over 2014, although not as big as was expected before. In the baseline scenario, in 2015 and 2016 copper and oil are expected to trade at somewhat higher prices than we thought in March (table 2). The Chilean economy has made a major adjustment in recent quarters, improving its external position and laying the foundation for a recovery without imbalances. This projection assumes that monetary policy will remain significantly expansionary and that fiscal policy will continue to contribute to expenditure growth in accordance with the fiscal rule and with the objectives set by the Administration. It also considers that the exchange rate depreciation accumulated since 2013 will continue to boost those tradable sectors that are more sensitive to the exchange rate. In addition, the price of fuels, which runs below the average of previous years, will continue to help reduce business costs and improve household income, even if its effects are smaller than expected a few months ago. As for inflation, in the baseline scenario the CPI should hover around 4 percent annually still for some months, and stabilize near 3 percent during 2016. The CPIEFE is expected to post an annual variation of close to 3 percent in 2016 and stay near that figure until the end of the projection horizon, this time the second quarter of 2017 (figure 7). This trajectory considers that the transmission to prices of the peso depreciation accumulated in the past year will be in line with its historical patterns; that real wages will be adjusted as a function of productivity; and that output gaps will remain over the projection horizon. For the RER, the methodological assumption used is that, the same as now, it will fluctuate in the upper part of the range believed to be consistent with its long-term fundamentals. As for the MPR, the working assumption is that the gradual withdrawal of the monetary impulse will be similar to what is suggested by surveys over a one-year horizon, meaning that monetary policy should start normalizing by the turn of next year (figure 8). The baseline scenario reflects those events that are believed to be the most likely to occur with the information at hand at the closing of this Report. There are risks, however, which, if materialized, may reshape the macroeconomic outlook and, therefore, may alter the course of monetary policy. Abroad, the main sources of risk remain, only more moderate. The possibility of specific events generating episodes of high volatility in global financial markets persists, affecting funding costs, the exchange rate and the short-term inflation outlook. On the one hand, any surprises regarding the timing or the pace at which the Fed will increase its benchmark rate can cause fluctuations in asset prices. On the other, there remains the risk of a default in Greece having an impact on global financial markets and GDP growth in the Eurozone. While these are still significant risks, the ability of the larger 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  central banks to handle these situations has improved, reducing to some extent the intensity of the negative impact of such events. This is not to say that there are no associated risks or that their persistence for so long would have lesser effects. A positive note is the more consolidated growth in the Eurozone, which has helped to configure a more balanced global economic scenario. In the emerging economies, there are still significant risks. While the risk of commodity prices dropping further seems to have eased, Latin American economies have been weaker for longer than expected. This has occurred in a context where the high fiscal and current account deficits persist in many economies, making the necessary adjustments expensive and difficult to implement. The risk of slower growth in China and its implications for the copper prices remains, although the Chinese authorities have given proof of their ability and desire to avoid abrupt corrections in their economy. Domestically, the economic recovery in the second half of the year should be accompanied by a significant improvement in confidence indicators, but so far it has not happened. To the extent that this situation continues, it is possible that domestic output and expenditure will fail to show the greater dynamism that is expected in the baseline scenario. Conversely, a scenario where expectations improve significantly would allow for a faster recovery of the economy, particularly in 2016. Regarding inflation, pressures are somewhat milder than expected in March, due to lower activity and the fact that, although with volatility, the peso has not continued to depreciate. However, in a context of persistently high inflation, with bounded margins, strong wage growth, higher fuel prices and external risk scenarios that can drive a significant further depreciation of the peso, inflationary risks remain important. As we are permanently aware of our legal mandate, this is one risk we analyze and monitor with special care. After evaluating these risks, the Board estimates that the risk balance is unbiased for both output and inflation. Summing up, inflation remains high, despite some decline in recent months. Domestic activity picked up in the first quarter, but the outlook for the second half of the year has moderated. As has been mentioned before, macroeconomic policies have played a countercyclical role. In particular, the stronger monetary impulse translated into a reduction of 200 basis points off the monetary policy rate, which helped to drive the long-term rates close to their historic lows. The not so buoyant economy and the gradual decline in inflation-in line with expectations- suggest that, under the assumptions of the baseline scenario, the discussion about the gradual withdrawal of the monetary stimulus could be delayed with respect to March expectations. Overall, any future changes in the MPR will depend on the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and their implications for the inflation outlook. Indeed, if inflation is higher and more unrelenting than we have foreseen, the normalization should be anticipated; but if the convergence of inflation to the target is faster than foreseen, the opposite should happen. Let me now present a brief review to the main issues in our Financial Stability Report. The Financial Stability Report Our Financial Stability Report discloses, on a half-yearly basis (in June and December), the recent macroeconomic and financial developments that might have an incidence on the Chilean economy’s financial stability. The Report we present today examines the same external risk scenarios I have just described. As I said, monetary policy in developed economies remains expansionary. The measures of the ECB and other central banks that cut down their benchmark rates have continued to push down sovereign long-term rates, although lately they have shown some reversal. This, 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  plus still bounded risk premiums, have led to increased issue of debt, mainly corporate. Thus, an environment of low-cost funding and incentives to risk taking persists, where vulnerabilities may be incubating that could emerge as the global financial situation approaches normality. Again, the outlook for emerging economies has continued to deteriorate. Despite a very recent increase, the prices of commodities-especially oil-are below their levels of recent years, affecting net exporting countries. Meanwhile, the growth prospects for China, Russia, and particularly Latin America are also declining motivated by idiosyncratic elements. Therefore, there is the risk that, beyond the real channel, commercial links and direct investments by Chilean companies, one cannot rule out financial contagion episodes in the prices of some assets, such as the exchange rate and sovereign spreads. Internally, the note of caution of previous Reports with respect to the situation of the corporate sector is maintained. Indebtedness as a percentage of GDP reached 114 at the end of 2014. This increase came mainly from a higher external debt and the peso depreciation (figure 9). Financial strength indicators of the companies reporting to the SVS are similar to those described in previous Reports, but low compared with historical averages (figure 10). This reflects a loss in the sector’s resilience to the possibility of a less favorable macroeconomic environment. Finally, some bank payment indicators have also deteriorated, with varying effects across banks, but especially affecting medium-sized ones. Activity in the residential housing market remains strong, with prices still on the rise. The moderation of production costs and anticipated purchases facing the upcoming enactment of the tax reform could be behind the sustained dynamic of the residential sector; meanwhile, price indicators continue to grow, although some moderation is observed in specific areas. In the office space sector, new square meters built were not matched by an equivalent increase in demand, generating a significant increase in the vacancy rate, as we warned in previous Reports. These levels could remain for a prolonged period due to the inertia of the market and the incorporation of new projects (figure 11). Aggregate household indicators remain relatively stable, but with some of them showing a marginal deterioration. The debt over disposable income rose in 2014, while the financial burden remained around 14 percent of income, due to low interest rates (figure 12). The lower interest rates facing households are also the result of a change in debt composition, away from higher-rate consumer loans to lower-rate mortgage loans. No changes in indicators of bank default are seen, whereas in non-bank lenders a new increase is observed. This latter phenomenon is partly explained by regulatory adjustments, although a worsening of the credit portfolios of said lenders cannot be ruled out. Commercial and consumer credit exhibit bounded growth rates, not so mortgage loans, which remain strong (figure 13). The behavior of commercial and consumer loans is in line with the slower growth in private spending. Demand-side factors could be behind these dynamics, as suggested by the Bank Lending Survey. The expansion of mortgage lending is largely explained by the increase in the average debt, which is consistent with the dynamic of housing prices and debt to collateral ratios, which have remained stable. Bank financial indicators have been stable. Operating income continues to be the primary contributor to the profitability of banks, which fell from the end of 2014, to 16 percent of equity in March. This was due to the reversal of the temporary impact of inflation on the indexation margin and a reduction in interest rate spreads. Bond issues by the banks contribute to the diversification of funding sources, but medium-sized banks remain highly dependent on wholesale funding. Stress tests yield that the levels of capitalization permit to absorb the materialization of a scenario of severe conditions (figure 14). In short, the internal and external scenarios are virtually unchanged from the last Report, although the persistence of very favorable global financing conditions can incubate vulnerabilities that would emerge if and when such conditions disappear. This would have a 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  significant impact on global financial markets, particularly in emerging economies, whose growth prospects have been on a downward trend. In this context, the increasing indebtedness of domestic credit users (firms and households) translates into lower resilience to possible financial stress events, or to a deterioration of the macroeconomic environment. Chile maintains adequate solvency and external liquidity to confront international financial stress scenarios. However, this does not insulate the country from such developments and their effects. I would like to finish with some final thoughts. Final thoughts The macroeconomic outlook has not changed much with respect to projections in March. Output and demand are posting moderate annual growth rates, but still with some improvement over the second half of last year. This is good news. However, marginal data show some loss of strength which, combined with low confidence indicators for firms and households, leads us to estimate that the recovery foreseen for the second half of this year will proceed at a slower pace. Accordingly, we have adjusted our growth forecast for this year downward, by one fourth of a point. Inflation has moderated but is still high and thus it is our main worry. In our baseline scenario, we have it around 4 percent for some months to later descend toward our 3 percent target. About the risks facing financial stability, the Report shows no big changes either. Corporate borrowing continued to rise in the past few quarters. Although there are obvious factors behind this trend, such as increased external borrowing-a logical development given the good credit conditions-and the depreciation of the peso, we must not relent in our efforts to closely monitor these tendencies. Anyway, figures also show that the households’ and firms’ financial burden has not increased, largely because interest rates are low, in line with our clearly expansionary monetary policy. The external scenario has also behaved as we outlined in March. The recovery of developed economies looks more balanced across countries, boosting confidence in consolidated growth of the developed world. Emerging markets continue to show some further weakening, especially in our region. Global financial conditions are still on the favorable side from a historical perspective, which in no case means that a sudden turnaround cannot happen. As a matter of fact, the consequences on global financial markets of a negative outcome in Greece or the ever closer rise in US interest rates are still significant risk situations which, despite having been on the horizon for so long, must not be overlooked or forgotten. Chile, as we have said time and again, has been able to confront the changes in external and internal conditions via a significant and quick adjustment. The absence of large imbalances, combined with the proper macroeconomic policy framework, are, in our view, key elements, although not sufficient, to generate the conditions required to resume growth levels that allow us to reach the desired development of our country. In this context, I would like to note that I fully endorse what the Finance Minister said recently, that fiscal stimulus-and I would add monetary stimulus as well-cannot by itself persistently maintain the growth of the economy. On the fiscal front, it is clear that, as stated by the appropriate authority, to honor the commitments on the matter, spending cannot grow eternally at the rates projected for this year. On the monetary front, given the baseline scenario, the convergence of inflation is inconsistent with a bigger impulse than the present one. Thus, beyond any minor adjustments, which depend on the evolution of the business cycle, it is clear that both monetary and fiscal policies have already done their job and there is not much room for either one to do more. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Thus, to resume growth, we need to create the environment that allows investment to recover, resource allocation to gain efficiency and productivity to improve. One key element of this task is for households and businesses to regain confidence in that the economy will provide the proper environment to carry out their projects. Sadly, and against our predictions, this is taking longer than we thought. For our part, we will continue to do our best efforts to smooth the business cycle, but always with price stability as the primary objective. This is why, as I mentioned earlier, inflation remains our primary concern, and although it has dropped as we projected, it is still high. In that context, as has been our assessment since late last year, we see no room for further cuts to the monetary policy rate. And while the current conditions make it more likely that the gradual withdrawal of the monetary stimulus will take place in the first months of 2016, I want to emphasize that it will depend on actual and inflation projected for the months ahead behaving in line with our estimates. And last but not least, on behalf of the Board, I wish to stress that we will conduct our monetary policy to ensure that inflation stands at 3 percent over the policy horizon, and we insist on the need for every participant in the financial system to thoroughly evaluate their borrowing and lending decisions. In addition, we will continue to contribute with what is our task, i.e., safeguarding the stability of the currency and the normal functioning of internal and external payments, to Chile’s development and welfare. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jean-Pierre Danthine: Presentation of the Swiss National Bank’s Financial Stability Report Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Vice Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 18 June 2015. *      *      * As my colleague Thomas Jordan has explained, global economic growth in the first quarter of 2015 was below expectations. However, over the last 12 months, we have seen an improvement in international economic and financial conditions, although substantial risks remain. The domestic environment has become more challenging due to the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc that followed the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate in January 2015. Against this background, I would like to examine the situation at Swiss banks from a financial stability perspective, looking first at the big banks and then moving on to a discussion of domestically focused banks. A more detailed assessment of the situation can be found in the latest Financial Stability Report published today. Big banks Further improving resilience Over the past year, the Swiss big banks have continued to improve their capital situation, albeit at a slower pace than the year before. They already meet most of the requirements which will apply from 2019. While acknowledging the progress made, the SNB recommends that the big banks do not lose momentum in their efforts to improve their resilience. This is particularly warranted with regard to the leverage ratio. Resilience needs to be further improved for three reasons: First, the big banks’ loss potential relative to their capitalisation continues to be substantial. Second, while the Swiss big banks’ risk-weighted capital ratios are above the average for large globally active banks, the same cannot yet be said for their leverage ratios. Third, it can be expected that regulatory developments at both international and national level will result in increased capital requirements.1 The Swiss big banks should prepare for these developments. RWA problem identified, but not yet resolved In the capital regulation of banks, risk-weighted assets (RWA) play a key role. As mentioned in previous Financial Stability Reports, both markets’ and authorities’ confidence in RWA calculated using banks’ internal models has steadily declined. A number of studies have shown that, in some instances, model-based RWA do not properly reflect a bank’s economic risks.2 As a consequence, capital ratios calculated using model-based RWA may overstate the true level of resilience.                                                 1 Based on the review of the Swiss “too big to fail” regulations by the group of experts on the further development of the financial market strategy (Brunetti group of experts), the Federal Council has instructed the Federal Department of Finance to prepare legal adjustments, which primarily concern more stringent capital requirements. Cf. media release of the Federal Council, 18 February 2015. 2 For instance, international studies have revealed significant differences in RWA between banks using the model-based approach. These can only be partially explained by differences in the level of risk taken by the banks. Cf., for example, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Regulatory consistency assessment programme (RCAP) – Analysis of risk-weighted assets for market risks, January 2013; cf. also EBA, Interim results of the EBA review of the consistency of risk-weighted assets, 26 February 2013; Barclays, The dog that dug, 21 September 2012. Studies at national level have also shown that model-based RWA are too low in some cases. Cf. FINMA Annual Media Conference, “Models and their limitations”, 31 March 2015. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  To address this problem, regulatory initiatives have been launched at international and national level. At international level, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is fundamentally revising the standardised approach. The Committee is also examining the introduction of a floor for internally modelled RWA based on this revised standardised approach. One important objective of the floor would be to ensure that capital requirements based on banks’ internal models do not fall below a prudent level. At national level, FINMA – together with the big banks and with the support of the SNB – has conducted a comparison between RWA calculated using the model-based and standardised approaches. The results of this comparison, in addition to the measures already taken by FINMA and those expected at the international level, will be taken into account by a working group led by the Federal Department of Finance. This working group will draw up proposals and the associated legal adjustments for implementing the recommendations in the Federal Council’s ‘too big to fail’ evaluation report. Alongside these regulatory initiatives, the SNB still considers it necessary that the big banks increase transparency with regard to RWA. FINMA has now called on these banks to disclose the differences between calculations using the model-based and standardised approaches. Such enhanced transparency is necessary to restore the credibility of model-based RWA and to strengthen market discipline. The SNB continues to hold the view that risk-weighted capital requirements – including a floor for model-based RWA – and leverage ratio requirements should complement each other. Risk-weighted requirements should guide economic decisions at the margin, while the leverage ratio should serve as a backstop. Yet, until the measures to resolve the RWA problem take effect, it is prudent to give a greater weighting to the leverage ratio when assessing the big banks’ resilience. Indeed, analysts increasingly pay attention to the leverage ratio when assessing and comparing banks. Domestically focused commercial banks Increased mortgage exposure, capital situation stable I would now like to turn to the domestically focused commercial banks. In 2014, these banks further increased their exposure to the Swiss mortgage and residential real estate markets. While the share of new loans with high loan-to-income ratios – a measure of affordability risk – remained persistently high, mortgage lending growth and the share of new mortgage loans with a high loan-to-value ratio decreased. Hence, the increase in exposure was lower than in previous years. With respect to bank capitalisation, the situation remained largely unchanged in 2014. First, the domestically focused commercial banks’ leverage ratios remained stable at high levels by historical standards. Second, these banks’ risk-weighted capital ratios increased slightly and are significantly above regulatory minimum requirements overall. Furthermore, stress test results suggest that most domestically focused banks should be able to absorb estimated losses without seeing their capitalisation fall below the regulatory minimum. Nevertheless, under the most relevant adverse scenarios for these banks, the losses would deplete a large proportion of their surplus capital. Experience in Switzerland in the 1990s, as in other countries, suggests that this would lead to a general weakening of the banking sector and significantly affect banks’ ability to lend, with negative and lasting repercussions for the real economy. The stress test results highlight the importance of banks holding significant capital surpluses relative to the regulatory minimum requirements. The activation of the countercyclical capital buffer in 2013 and its increase in 2014 has made a significant contribution in this respect. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Risk of renewed increase in imbalances on mortgage and real estate markets Overall, imbalances on the mortgage and residential real estate markets have remained broadly unchanged since the last Financial Stability Report. From a financial stability perspective, this is a positive development. However, it is still too early to give the all-clear. On the one hand, imbalances remain at a high level and have not yet started to decline. On the other hand, the further decline of capital and money market interest rates observed since January 2015 carries the risk of a renewed increase in imbalances on the Swiss mortgage and residential real estate markets over the medium term. First, compared to alternative assets, investments in real estate appear to have become more attractive for banks, commercial investors and households. In the residential investment property segment in particular, additional demand from investors searching for yield might push prices up further. Second, the unprecedented interest rate environment creates additional incentives for banks to incur higher interest rate and credit risks. They might be tempted to increase both maturity transformation and lending to compensate for the additional pressure on margins and to stabilise short-term profitability. Such strategies would further increase banks’ exposure to large interest rate shocks and to a correction on the mortgage and real estate markets. Given these risks to financial stability, banks and authorities should remain alert and, if necessary, take measures to contain such risks. In particular, should momentum on the mortgage and residential real estate markets pick up again, additional measures might become necessary. In this regard, particular attention should be paid to the investment property segment. This segment is more likely to be materially affected by the additional demand from investors searching for yield in the current environment. Furthermore, the measures taken so far have predominantly addressed the segment of owner-occupied residential real estate. For its part, the SNB will continue to monitor developments on the mortgage and real estate markets closely, and will reassess the need for an adjustment to the countercyclical capital buffer on a regular basis. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Thomas Jordan: Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy decision and assessment of the economic situation Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the media news conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 18 June 2015. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen It is a pleasure for me to welcome you to the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) news conference. As usual, I shall begin by outlining the Governing Board’s monetary policy decision and our assessment of the economic situation. This will be followed by Jean-Pierre Danthine’s presentation of our annual Financial Stability Report and Fritz Zurbrügg’s comments on financial market developments. After that, we will be happy to take your questions. Monetary policy decision Let me begin with our monetary policy decision. The SNB has decided to leave the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at between –1.25% and –0.25% and interest on sight deposits at the SNB is to remain at –0.75%. Negative interest rates in Switzerland make holding investments in Swiss francs less attractive and will help to weaken the Swiss franc over time. Overall, the Swiss franc is significantly overvalued. In formulating our monetary policy, we take account of the exchange rate situation and its impact on inflation and economic developments. We will therefore remain active in the foreign exchange market, as necessary, in order to influence monetary conditions. Our new conditional inflation forecast does not differ greatly from the one we presented in March. Inflation will reach its low point in the third quarter of 2015, at –1.2%. For the subsequent period, the new inflation forecast is slightly higher than in March due to the rise in oil prices. The short and medium-term forecast is up slightly, by 0.1 percentage points to –1.0% for 2015 and to –0.4% for 2016. The forecast continues to indicate that inflation will move back into positive territory at the beginning of 2017; there will be a slight slowdown in the rate of increase as the year progresses. The inflation forecast for 2017 is down by 0.1 percentage points, to 0.3%. The conditional forecast assumes that the three-month Libor will remain at –0.75% over the entire forecast horizon, and that the Swiss franc will weaken. Global economic outlook As our inflation forecast is heavily influenced by economic developments abroad, let me now present our assessment of the global economy. Global economic growth was weaker than expected in the first quarter of 2015, and this development had a detrimental impact on world trade. In the US, GDP declined slightly, partly due to special factors. Moreover, the strong US dollar weighed on exports. In the euro area, however, the economy continued to pick up, supported by persistent euro weakness and improved lending conditions. In contrast to the previous quarter, all of the large member states contributed to growth. Italy reported GDP growth for the first time since entering a multi-year recession. In Japan, too, the economy gained momentum. In the emerging economies, performance remained uneven, while growth continued to cool in China. The global economy is expected to gather pace again, reinforced by expansionary monetary policy around the world and ongoing low oil prices. For instance, after a disappointing first 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  quarter, the two large economies, the US and China, are starting to show signs of improvement. Nonetheless, uncertainty about the future development of the global economy remains high. Various risks – first and foremost the difficult financial situation in Greece and geopolitical tensions – could jeopardise the recovery. Swiss economic outlook According to initial estimates, Switzerland’s real GDP declined slightly in the first quarter. As expected, goods exports suffered from the strong Swiss franc appreciation, but also from a downturn in global trade. Domestic demand, by contrast, developed robustly. Having said this, the situation varies considerably from one industry to another. Profit margins are under significant pressure in several sectors, and this is forcing companies to take steps to reduce production costs and raise efficiency. Against this backdrop, unemployment has increased slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis. Over the coming months, the global economic recovery is likely to lead to a gradual upturn in demand for Swiss products; this will cushion the impact of the exchange rate shock somewhat. As the global economy gathers momentum, we expect Switzerland to return to positive growth in the second half of the year. The SNB continues to anticipate growth of just under 1% for 2015 as a whole. Monetary and financial conditions Allow me to move on now to monetary and financial conditions. Since the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate, inflation has moved well into negative territory. This is chiefly attributable to imported goods prices, which in May were down roughly 5% year-on-year, mainly due to the fall in oil prices. Domestic inflation, meanwhile, remains in positive territory. Our inflation forecast shows that the period of negative inflation will be temporary; it is part of an adjustment process following the sharp appreciation of the Swiss franc. The SNB does not currently expect a sustained price decline or, indeed, a deflationary spiral with the associated harmful effects on economic activity and employment. Available surveys on inflation expectations of households and companies present a similar picture. Short-term inflation expectations have stabilised, albeit at a very low level. Long-term inflation expectations have remained virtually unchanged over the last half-year.1 They remain within a range that is consistent with the SNB’s definition of price stability. Low inflation rates translate to low nominal interest rates. On the money market, short-term interest rates are close to the interest on sight deposits at the SNB of –0.75%; interest rates in Switzerland are thus lower than in most other countries. However, due to negative inflation, Switzerland’s real interest rates, which ultimately determine investment returns, are higher than its nominal rates. Moreover, they are also higher than real interest rates in other countries, such as the US, Germany and the UK. My colleague, Fritz Zurbrügg, will provide further details on interest rate developments on the money and capital markets. Despite the low interest rates, mortgage growth has continued to weaken slightly in recent months. Notwithstanding this, imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets remain high. My colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will discuss this in greater depth in his remarks.                                                 1 In October 2014, Consensus Economics projected inflation expectations of 1.4% for the period 2020–2024; in April 2015, it put these at 1.5% for the period 2021–2025. Long-term inflation expectations are only surveyed on a half-yearly basis. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In light of the uncertainty regarding the future of Greece, the Swiss franc continues to serve as a safe haven currency. In trade-weighted terms, the Swiss franc is still approximately 12% higher than it was at the beginning of the year. Over time, negative interest rates on the Swiss money and capital markets should help to correct the overvaluation of the Swiss franc. The rise in long-term interest rates abroad has also led to a widening of the interest rate differential with these countries of late. As conditions continue to normalise on international financial markets, investments in other currencies should become more attractive; this, in turn, is likely to help ease the overvaluation of the Swiss franc. The slowdown we are now observing in the economy also suggests that the Swiss franc is very unlikely to remain persistently high. Monetary policy outlook I shall now move on to our monetary policy. Since 15 January, we have repeatedly and thoroughly explained our reasons for discontinuing the minimum exchange rate and introducing negative interest on sight deposits at the SNB. Upholding the minimum exchange rate was no longer sustainable given the changes taking place in the international arena and the sharply diverging monetary policy stances of the world’s major currency blocks. In formulating our monetary policy, we are confronted with an exceptionally complex situation on international financial markets. What is more, the global economy is still grappling with the after-effects of the financial and economic crisis, not least in the form of high levels of uncertainty. These are the realities that the SNB – and the Swiss economy – are facing. Turning a blind eye is not an option. In this environment, we were aware that the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate would cause Switzerland’s economy to slow. While the data from the first quarter confirm that this slowing process is now underway, the country’s economic development since 15 January has been broadly in line with our expectations. Our monetary policy is geared towards this challenging set of circumstances and is currently guided by our willingness to take an active role in the foreign exchange market and apply negative interest rates. This two-pronged approach is designed to weaken the Swiss franc. The SNB’s interventions in the foreign exchange market, which feed more liquidity into the banking system, reinforce the effect of both of these measures. We intend to retain the current interest rate level for now and will monitor its effects closely. With respect to setting interest rates and supplying the money market with liquidity, the SNB’s monetary policy decisions have been very bold by international standards. All things considered, the Swiss franc nevertheless remains significantly overvalued. Were Switzerland not to have negative interest rates, and hence have a narrower interest rate differential with other countries, demand for Swiss francs would be even greater and our currency would be even stronger today. We are aware that the current exchange rate situation is extremely difficult for exporters, tourism and industries that are particularly exposed to competition from abroad. While we recognise the scale of the challenges facing the affected companies, it is worth remembering that in the current climate there is, regrettably, no easy solution that would absorb all external disruptions. We must accept these challenging economic conditions for the time being. That said, we are convinced that, under the circumstances, the SNB’s current choice of monetary policy will best serve Switzerland’s overall interests in the long term. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. It is now my pleasure to give the floor to Jean-Pierre Danthine, who will present our Financial Stability Report. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, before the Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 16 June 2015. *      *      * Mr Chairman, Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to be back to this committee for my regular hearing. Today, I would like to share with you the ECB’s assessment of the current economic and monetary conditions in the euro area. I will then touch on the subject chosen for our exchange of views, namely the risks and side-effects of our asset purchase programme. Finally, I will say a few words about the current situation in Greece. Economic outlook and monetary policy The latest economic indicators and survey data broadly confirm our assessment that the economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace. While growth has been mainly supported by private consumption in recent quarters, we now see encouraging signs that also private investment is picking up, which underlies our expectation that the economic recovery should broaden. This will be supported in particular by our monetary policy measures, which are working their way through to the real economy, by the comparatively low price of oil, and by improvements in external price competitiveness. This is also reflected in the latest Eurosystem staff projections: we project economic growth to increase from 1.5% of GDP in 2015 to 1.9% in 2016 and to 2.0% in 2017. After some months with negative or zero rates, inflation in May has increased modestly, standing at 0.3% in year-on-year terms, as the negative contributions from energy prices are fading. We expect inflation to remain low in the months ahead before rising stepwise around the turn of the year. Thereafter, inflation is expected to gradually converge toward levels closer to but still below 2%. In the Eurosystem staff projections of June, inflation is projected to increase from 0.3% in 2015 to 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. Over the last quarter, money and credit dynamics have strengthened overall. The growth of broad money in April stood at 5.3%, and in part reflects the expansion of bond purchases by the Eurosystem. While improving further, loan growth to the private sector, standing at 0.8% in April, has lagged somewhat the pace at which monetary trends have been firming. It remains moderate – atypically so, after such a prolonged phase of credit compression – and uneven across the euro area economies with new loans to enterprises particularly weak. Overall, we remain prudently confident that all economic and monetary conditions are in place to support a gradual reflation of the euro area economy, with a sustained return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2%. This assessment is based on the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures. We need to keep a steady monetary policy course and firmly implement those measures, including our expanded asset purchase programme. It is our clear intention to purchase private and public sector securities of EUR 60 billion per month on average until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Over recent weeks, financial markets have registered a measurable trend reversal in prices and a surge in volatility, with the fixed-income market the epicentre of the correction. Let me make two observations in this respect. First, a period of higher volatility is a phenomenon that is frequently observed not long after the start of a large quantitative programme, when short-term rates are pressed against their lower bound. Price discovery is gradual and complex in a world in which central banks intervene in long-dated securities and markets re-appraise prospects for the macro-economy in exceptionally uncertain conditions. Second, and notwithstanding these developments, financial market conditions remain accommodative and supportive of the economic recovery in the euro area. For example, given the amount of accommodation that was introduced even before our expanded asset purchase programme commenced in March, bank lending rates – a key indicator of financing conditions in the euro area – are still trending down. Since the announcement of the expanded APP, the composite bank lending rates for euro area NFCs declined by 13 basis points to 2.30% in April (and compared with 2.79% in June 2014). Bank lending rates on loans to households for house purchase declined by 25 basis points to 2.25% in April (and compared with 2.87% in June 2014). In addition, most measures of cross-country dispersion show tangible declines for NFCs. As interest rates on outstanding loans are re-set, and new credit contracts embodying more favourable terms for borrowers replace old ones, financial accommodation reaches a growing number of consumers and investors. This incremental process has not yet run its course. It is still on-going. This being said, in the process of price adjustment, the term structure of the money market interest rates has come under intense upward pressure. The expected policy rate path implied by money market quotes has shifted up and steepened noticeably as a consequence. The very short end of the curve – because of expanding surpluses of liquidity – has remained well-anchored around levels that are broadly in line with our forward guidance over those horizons. We are closely monitoring conditions to detect signs of an unwarranted tightening of our stance, to which we would need to react. Risks and side-effects of APP Engaging in a large-scale asset purchase programme is not without risks and side effects. Let me focus here on the financial risks of our own balance sheet, on financial stability implications for the euro area, and on effects on income distribution. We monitor very closely the risks for the Eurosystem’s balance sheet associated with our asset purchase programmes and we manage those risks to keep them at levels that do not threaten our capacity to fulfil our policy mandate to maintain price stability. In particular, we manage credit risk by exclusively purchasing assets of sufficient credit quality, by defining an asset allocation and a limit framework that ensures some degree of diversification, and by applying severe due diligence and monitoring processes. With regard to PSPP, we also decided that the purchases of government bonds conducted by the Eurosystem NCBs will not be risk-shared within the Eurosystem. This does not hamper the effectiveness of the purchase programme and the singleness of our monetary policy. The Governing Council has full control over all the design features of the programme. The specific risk-sharing agreement takes into account the unique institutional structure of the euro area, in which a common currency and a single monetary policy coexist alongside 19 national fiscal policies. As regards possible financial stability risks, we assess these risks as rather contained for now. Looking in particular at housing markets in the euro area, we don’t see any signs of general overvaluation. Important indicators for increasing financial imbalances are real estate prices and credit growth, but so far we have witnessed low growth rates of both. For instance, the annual growth rate of prices for houses and apartments in the euro area 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  increased on average by 0.8% in the last quarter of 2014. The annual growth rate of loans for house purchases stood at 0.1% in April 2015. Nevertheless, we monitor developments closely. If needed, macro-prudential policy tools should be used to safeguard financial stability. Finally, large-scale asset purchases – as any other monetary policy measure – have distributional consequences. In the short run, the current combination of low interest rates, forward guidance and asset purchases is conducive to a change in asset prices and to wealth gains for investors holding a wide spectrum of assets. But this mechanism of asset price changes lies at the heart of monetary policy transmission and is set in motion every time a central bank activates its instruments of monetary policy, whether conventional or unconventional, in the pursuit of its objective. Interest rate changes always alter the attractiveness of saving relative to consumption and can influence the debt burden of borrowers. Likewise, the current accommodative monetary policy stance eases financing conditions throughout the economy, boosting consumption and investment and, ultimately, inflation. This is an absolute precondition for interest rates to return to more normal levels consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. By reducing the cyclical component of unemployment, it also contributes to reducing a major source of inequality, particularly amongst the young and lower-income groups. In the end, all citizens across the euro area will benefit most from an environment of stable prices, macroeconomic stability, economic growth and job creation in the longer run. The current situation in Greece Finally, let me say a few words on the situation in Greece and the ECB’s role. As is the case for any member country of the euro area, the ECB, in the context of the euro system, fulfils its mandate as central bank toward Greece. Furthermore, the SSM Regulation you adopted together with the Council in 2013 made the ECB the supervisor of the Greek banking system through direct and indirect supervision. And in the two-pack, Parliament and Council have asked the Commission to liaise with the ECB when negotiating the conditionality attached to the adjustment programmes and when reviewing their implementation. When it comes to monetary policy and supervisory action, the ECB will continue to take its decisions in full independence and in accordance with our legal framework. This rules-based approach is what is required from us. This is what we have been following and will continue to follow. In this context, the Eurosystem has provided support to allow Greek banks to continue financing the economy. Currently, the central bank liquidity extended to Greek banks amounts to around EUR 118 billion, more than double the amount at end 2014. The current liquidity support represents around 66% of Greece’s GDP, the highest level as a share of GDP of any euro area country. Last week, the Governing Council decided not to object to a further increase in the ELA ceiling, by EUR 2.3 billion to EUR to 83 billion. Liquidity will continue to be extended as long as Greek banks are solvent and have sufficient collateral. However, in a situation where the Greek government does not have market access, this liquidity can not be used to circumvent the prohibition of monetary financing, as laid out in Art. 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This, together with supervisory considerations, explains why there is a ceiling on the Greek T-bills held by the Greek banking sector. For the Governing Council to reconsider the T-Bills ceiling, there should be a credible perspective for a successful conclusion of the current review and subsequent implementation which would imply the disbursement of programme funds by euro area Member States. This would also significantly improve the outlook for future market access by the Greek government. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It should be absolutely clear that the decision on whether to conclude the review of the current programme and disburse further financial support to Greece lies entirely with the Eurogroup, so ultimately with euro area Member States. Hence this is a political decision that will have to be taken by elected policymakers, not by central bankers. In the meantime, we will continue to provide our advice on the adjustment programmes. It is within this context, that we need a strong and comprehensive agreement with Greece, and we need this very soon. By strong and comprehensive I mean an agreement that produces growth, that has social fairness, but that is also fiscally sustainable, ensures competitiveness, and addresses the remaining sources of financial instability. I can assure you that the ECB is doing all it can to facilitate a successful outcome. Such a strong and credible agreement with Greece is needed, not only in the interest of Greece, but also of the euro area as a whole. While all actors will now need to go the extra mile, the ball lies squarely in the camp of the Greek government to take the necessary steps. Conclusion The situation in Greece reminds us again that the Economic and Monetary Union is an unfinished construction as long as we do not have all tools in place to ensure that all euro area members are economically, fiscally and financially sufficiently resilient. To complete the Economic and Monetary Union, we need a quantum leap towards a stronger, more efficient institutional architecture. As you know, my colleagues and I are currently working on a report that will aim at showing a roadmap for this. We are in the final stages of this process, and I hope you understand that also out of respect for my colleagues, I will not be able to tell you more than what I have already said repeatedly: That we will need to put our institutional framework on a much stronger footing; that we need, as I just said, a quantum leap. I am now looking forward to our discussion. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Guy Debelle: Remarks on financial integration in the Asia Pacific Speech by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Launch of the Australian Centre for Financial Studies report on Financial Integration in the Asia Pacific, Sydney, 16 June 2015 *      *      * Thanks to Marc-Oliver Thurner and David Norman for their assistance. Accompanying charts can be found on the Reserve Bank of Australia’s website. It is a pleasure to speak at the launch of the Australian Centre for Financial Studies (ACFS) work on Financial Integration in the Asia Pacific. I have had some first hand experience on financial integration through the Asian Bond Fund (ABF) initiative, working with my fellow central bankers in Asia through EMEAP. In particular, in launching ABF2 and the Pan-Asian Index Fund (PAIF) around a decade ago, we got direct exposure to some of the impediments to financial integration in the region, both regulatory and tax. We worked together to reduce some of those impediments, which helped to pave the way for an expansion in cross-border fixed income investment in the region. I would like to talk about some issues that come to mind when thinking about financial integration. In doing so, my aim is to pose questions that the ACFS work might consider, without providing any answers. The first issue is about developments over the past decade or so, which show that financial integration is not a monotonic process. It is not always onwards and upwards. There was a reversal in some metrics of financial integration after 2008. In particular, cross-border banking flows declined steeply in 2008 and 2009, and have, in aggregate, continued to shrink until fairly recently. Interestingly, cross-border flows involving Chinese and Japanese banks have been increasing while those elsewhere, particularly in Europe, have been declining. We have seen that here in Australia, with lending by Chinese and Japanese banks into Australia growing quite rapidly (albeit from a low base), as lending from European banks has been declining (Graph 1). Some Chinese banks have obtained Australian banking licences while some European banks have given them up. In light of these developments, one question that is worth contemplating is whether there is such a thing as an optimal degree of financial integration? Can there be too much of it? The experience of the financial crisis shows that at least some forms of financial integration didn’t go too well. Relatedly, what is the most beneficial form of financial integration? Is it cross-border banking flows? And if so, should those flows be through a branch or a subsidiary, taking account of the varying regulatory environments that come with that choice? Are bank to bank flows more problematic than direct lending by foreign banks to domestic borrowers? The experience of cross-border banking is also replete with examples of the last-mover disadvantage. The general argument mounted in support of cross-border banking is that it allows a bank to profitably utilise its knowledge, systems and skills in a new market. But is that best done by partnering with an existing bank, or entering the market on your own? While there may be opportunities that arise with a better banking model, it can often be the case that all the good credits are taken. The local banks already have well-established relationships with the customers with the strong balance sheets and it may be quite difficult to wean them away, however attractive the proposition put to them. This can lead to the new entrant filling its book with the fish John West rejects. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, nor obviously unprofitable, but the credit quality is likely to be lower. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Alternatively, are flows intermediated by markets more beneficial, whether in the form of bonds or equity? For many years, there has been a marked contrast in the financial structure of the US and most of the rest of the world. In the US, there is a considerably higher share of market-based intermediation, whereas in the rest of the world, including Australia and Asia, bank-based intermediation has the lion’s share of financing. One consequence of the regulatory reform program after the crisis is that it has tended to increase the cost of bank-intermediated finance. As a result, market intermediation is increasing, which will have implications for the future of financial integration in Asia. This is evident in the recent strong issuance of offshore bonds by Asian non-financial corporations. Much of this rise has been driven by Chinese issuers, which now account for about 40 per cent of the bond issuance by Asian non-financial corporations (Graph 2). However, borrowing from banks still represents the vast majority of debt of Asian non-financial corporations. Another question that arises is which of these forms of cross-border flows – banking or market-based – are more stable? This is an issue which gets a lot of attention in the Asian region and will once again come into sharp relief when the Fed raises its policy rate. The increase in cross-border flows into emerging markets over recent years, particularly in the Asian region, has contained a large amount of market-based finance. Asset managers have a much higher share of emerging Asia in their funds under management today than they did a decade ago. How stable are these flows likely to be in a more volatile environment? What is the behaviour of the investors who have allocated a higher share of their portfolio to emerging markets? How much of that increased share is a result of a search for higher yield which might reverse when yields in traditional developed markets increase? How much of it is a structural diversification into the emerging world as it has become a much larger share of the global economic and financial landscape? A major influence on the future path of financial integration in the Asia-Pacific region will be developments in Chinese financial markets. China is on a path of financial deregulation and capital account liberalisation. Almost no other country has managed this process without encountering significant problems. While China has endeavoured to learn the lessons from all the other countries that have gone down this path, including Australia, it will be a significant achievement if they are able to pull it off without encountering some problems. Investing in China’s domestic markets has become easier over the past year, with a range of new initiatives gradually opening the capital account, at this stage, primarily by allowing more portfolio flows between Hong Kong and the mainland. The new schemes expand the avenues for investing in China’s domestic debt and equity markets from the existing RQFII and QFII programs, which at the end of May accounted for around US$140 billion of foreign investment in China. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme, which started in November last year, is at about half its northbound capacity of around US$50 billion. A Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect is expected to be announced soon. The mutual recognition of funds agreement, effective from July, will allow fund managers registered in Hong Kong to offer investment fund products to mainland residents (and vice versa). From an Australian perspective, these avenues should provide an opportunity for Australian banks, asset managers and their clients to increase their exposure to the Chinese domestic financial market. Australian international portfolio investment has been growing strongly over recent years from around A$450 billion in 2010 to over A$750 billion at the end of 2014 (Graph 3). While the share of Asian bond investment has risen a little over that period, the share of investment in Asian equities has been largely steady. Both remain at well below 10 per cent of total portfolio investment in offshore markets. There would appear to be significant scope for further financial integration with the region. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  To conclude, the work by the ACFS is focussing on an area of significant importance today and one that will be important for a long time to come. There are many issues to discuss, a few of which I have highlighted here. The briefing paper is a promising start and I wish them well for the rest of the project.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Christopher Kent: Monetary policy transmission – what’s known and what’s changed Public lecture by Mr Christopher Kent, Assistant Governor (Economic) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Australian National University, Canberra, 15 June 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found on the Reserve Bank of Australia’s website. I thank Laura Berger-Thomson, Adam Cagliarini, Gianni La Cava and Matthew Read for excellent suggestions and assistance in preparing these remarks. 1. Introduction I’d like to thank Rohan Pitchford and Martin Richardson for organising this event. It’s great to be back at the ANU, where almost 30 years ago I was embarking on my study of botany just across campus, with some economics on the side for good measure. It was my dislike of compulsory chemistry classes led me down that side path. Tonight I want to talk about the effects of monetary policy on the economy. Interest rates have been at very low levels for some time. Yet economic growth is below trend, the unemployment rate is relatively high and domestic inflationary pressures are well contained. This is expected to remain the case for a time. It’s natural then to ask whether monetary policy is less effective than in the past. Almost 20 years ago, Stephen Grenville, who was in my current role at the time, gave a comprehensive account of what we knew and didn’t know about the transmission of monetary policy in Australia.1 The structure of the economy has changed since then in ways that may have altered the transmission mechanism. So it is timely on two counts to consider how the monetary policy transmission mechanism is operating in the current environment. 2. How monetary policy works (in theory) 2.1 Overview of the transmission mechanism In responding to cyclical developments and inflation pressures, monetary policy has a significant influence on aggregate demand and inflation. The transmission of interest rates through the economy can be roughly described as follows. I’ll focus on an easing of monetary policy. 1. The Reserve Bank lowers the overnight cash rate. 2. Financial markets update expectations about the future path of cash rates and the structure of deposit and lending rates are quickly altered. 3. Over time, households and firms respond to lower interest rates by increasing their demand for credit, reducing their saving and increasing their (current) demand for goods, services and assets (such as housing and equities). 4. Other things equal, rising demand increases the prices of non-tradable goods and services. The price-setting behaviour of firms depends on demand conditions and                                                 1 Grenville S (1995), “The Monetary Policy Transmission Process: What Do We Know? (And What Don't We Know?)”, Talk to Australian Business Economists, Sydney, 28 August. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the cost of inputs, including of labour. Higher aggregate demand leads to increased labour demand and a rise in wages. The transmission mechanism depends crucially on how monetary policy affects households’ and firms’ expectations. Expectations about the future path of the cash rate will affect financial market prices and returns, asset prices and the expected prices of goods, services and factors of production (including labour). Expectations of more persistent changes in the cash rate will have larger effects. The extent to which lower interest rates lead to extra demand will depend on how households and businesses alter their behaviour regarding borrowing and investing, as well as consuming and saving. These responses are often described as occurring via a number of different channels. 2.2 How interest rates affect demand – various channels The exchange rate channel is one way in which interest rates affect demand. Lower interest rates contribute to an exchange rate depreciation by reducing returns to, and hence the demand for, domestic assets relative to foreign currency-denominated assets. A depreciation increases the prices of foreign products relative to domestic products. This leads to a switching of demand towards domestically produced goods and services. (A lower exchange rate also leads directly to an increase in import prices.) Many macroeconomic models emphasise intertemporal substitution as the primary transmission channel. Households and businesses make decisions about whether to save more or less now so as to spend more or less later. Lower interest rates provide less reward for saving, thereby encouraging more expenditure in the near term (and less further out). Decreases in interest rates will boost asset prices, which can have a number of effects. First, it boosts investment in housing, equipment and other capital goods as it becomes less expensive to build than to buy (this is likely to be important, although empirical evidence of the relevance of the ‘q-ratio’ is weak). Second, households typically respond to an increase in their net worth by consuming a little more at each point in time. This is known as the wealth channel, which appears important in the Australian context. The balance sheet channel is closely related. Rising net worth makes it easier to borrow, with higher collateral values making lending a less risky proposition. The cash-flow channel appears to be an important part of the transmission mechanism in Australia. Changes in interest rates affect households’ and businesses’ cash flows. If they face liquidity or borrowing constraints, an increase in cash flows will typically lead to more spending.2 For example, a decrease in interest rates lowers interest payments for households with variable-rate mortgages, leaving them with more disposable income to spend. At the same time, cash flows will be lower than otherwise for those with interest-earning assets and they may choose to restrict their spending. Notwithstanding this latter effect, decreases in interest rates can be expected to increase demand through this channel. This reflects the fact that the household sector in Australia is a net borrower, by which I mean that its interest bearing liabilities are greater than its interest-earning assets.3 Moreover, it seems plausible that marginal propensities to spend are generally higher for debtors (who may face credit constraints) than for creditors.                                                 2  Unconstrained households can adjust their borrowing so as to smooth their consumption in the face of temporary fluctuations in income. 3  In a closed economy context (with no public sector), a net debt position of the household sector would imply that the corporate sector is lending to households. In such a world, lower interest rates would benefit households with debt, but at the expense of lower payments to households that own the corporate sector. In this case, the cash-flow channel would depend on differences in marginal propensities to consume across different types of households. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  That’s a rough sketch of the theory of the transmission mechanism. What can we say about it in practice and how might it have changed over time? 3. Estimates of the overall effect of monetary policy It is difficult enough to estimate the strength of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in terms of its effect on the economy overall. It is harder still to separately identify the strength of each of the various channels. A key challenge is disentangling the effect of monetary policy from other influences, such as foreign developments or changes in fiscal policy. This requires models that simultaneously account for these and other forces. There are a wide range of model estimates from which to choose, each capturing different aspects of the ways in which the world works in reality. For illustrative purposes, let me mention just one set of recent estimates provided by some of my colleagues using a so-called Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model.4 Consider the estimated effects of a decrease in the cash rate of 100 basis points. This will lead GDP to be higher than otherwise by between about ½ and ¾ of a percentage point over the course of two years (Graph 1). Inflation is estimated to rise by somewhat less than ¼ percentage point per annum over 2–3 years. These estimates are close to those of other models.5 Estimates from this DSGE model tentatively suggest that the overall effect of monetary policy has not changed significantly in recent years. In particular, estimates of the ‘endogenous’ relationships in the model based on data up to 2008 (after which interest rates have been notably lower) are about the same as estimates based on data to the present day. This suggests that the period of below-trend growth in GDP over the past few years may not reflect a change in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Rather, the model attributes below-trend growth to sizeable exogenous forces or shocks. The sharp fall in commodity prices has played an important role of late. Also, weakness in private investment – beyond that which can be explained by subdued domestic demand and falling commodity prices – has made a sizeable contribution to below-trend growth. The model also suggests that consumption growth has been a bit weaker than in the past. These estimates provide some tentative evidence that the overall effect of monetary policy is neither more nor less effective than in the past. However, it may be that it’s too early to identify any structural change with the data to hand. Alternatively, the effect of monetary policy on overall activity and inflation might be close to its historical average, but this could mask changes in its effects across different parts of the economy or variation in the relative strength of the different channels from one episode to the next. 4. Estimates of some channels of monetary policy I’ll consider this possibility by looking more closely at the behaviour of dwelling construction and household consumption. I’ll leave to one side the effects of monetary policy on business                                                 4  See Rees D, P Smith and J Hall (2015), “A Multi-sector Model of the Australian Economy ,” RBA Research Discussion Paper No 2015-07. This paper does not explicitly model all of the various channels of monetary policy referred to above but the effect of a change in monetary policy on activity and inflation can loosely be interpreted as the operation of all of the relevant channels on these variables. 5  For example, see Dungey M and A Pagan (2000), ‘A Structural VAR Model of the Australian Economy’, Economic Record, 76(235), pp 321–342; Berkelmans L (2005), ‘Credit and Monetary Policy: An Australian SVAR’, RBA Research Discussion Paper No 2005–06; Bjørnland H (2009), ‘Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Overshooting: Dornbusch Was Right After All’, Journal of International Economics, 79(1), pp 64–77; and Jääskelä J and K Nimark (2011), ‘A Medium-scale New Keynesian Open Economy Model of Australia’, Economic Record, 87(276), pp 11–36. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  investment and external trade.6 I’d note though that a further rise in the growth rate of household expenditure should contribute, in time, to a pick-up in non-mining business investment. So too would a further depreciation of the exchange rate, which would raise the demand for domestic production. We have argued that a further exchange rate depreciation appears likely and necessary, particularly given the large declines in commodity prices this year. 4.1 Responsiveness of dwelling construction Dwelling construction is typically the most interest-rate sensitive component of expenditure in the Australian economy. It is growing strongly in response to low interest rates, rising by about 9 per cent over the past year (Graph 2). The results of a standard ‘single-equation’ reduced-form model suggest that the response (to date) of residential building approvals to lower interest rates and higher housing prices is broadly consistent with historical experience.7 Although the behaviour of construction investment over the past few years is not unusual, it is possible that with a period of very low rates there will be some limit as to how much demand for dwelling construction can be brought forward from the future. It is also possible that a period of very low interest rates will eventually lead to higher inflation for land and construction work, as is normally required to bring forth more supply of a particular good or service. These pressures might arise from a depletion of suitable land available for development or a need to attract more developers and workers into the industry. In such circumstances, any further increases in construction demand would tend to push up prices of existing and new dwellings. This could occur via increases in land prices, construction wages, developers’ margins or some combination of all three. The direct effect of additional demand for construction on economic activity would be less than in the case of ample spare capacity. But such a situation would still provide support to aggregate demand in other ways, including via the operation of the balance-sheet and wealth channels. There is evidence of some tightening in supply in pockets of the country. In some cities, stocks of unsold lots suitable for development appear to be unusually low (Graph 3). Shortages are most evident in Sydney, where greenfield land releases have not kept pace with recent strong demand. Also, some of the Bank’s liaison contacts are concerned that the stock of suitable sites for apartment developments in Sydney has been depleted in the past few years. There is little evidence of labour supply constraints outside a few trades and professional roles. However, inflation of building material prices has risen and the Bank’s liaison suggests that some builders have increased margins over the past year or so. Consistent with this, inflation in new dwelling costs has risen to be almost 2 percentage points above its average over the inflation-targeting period; although, it is still below that seen when dwelling construction was strong in the early 2000s. Despite the potential emergence of some constraints affecting the supply of new dwellings in pockets of the country, there appears to be scope for strong growth in new dwelling                                                 6  I’ve said quite a bit about the difficulty of modelling business investment. See Kent C (2014), ‘Non-mining Business Investment – Where to from Here?’, Address to the Bloomberg Summit, Sydney, 16 September. It is often difficult to find a significant empirical relationship between interest rates and business investment. For a discussion of how businesses respond to changes in interest rates see Lane K and T Rosewall (2015), ‘Firms’ Investment Decisions and Interest Rates’, RBA Bulletin, June, forthcoming. 7  It appears that there might be a slightly longer delay between the time approvals are granted and the construction of housing than in the past. This is likely to reflect the larger share of higher-density dwellings, which take longer to complete than detached dwellings. For more information on this point, see RBA (2015), ‘Box C: The Cycle in Dwelling Investment’, Statement on Monetary Policy, May, pp 43– 45. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  construction in other parts of the country. Moreover, alterations and additions activity could pick up. This used to account for about 45 per cent of total dwelling construction, but has declined over the past few years, despite lower interest rates and the sizeable increase in dwelling prices. In short, there are some signs of tightening supply conditions in pockets of the country, but dwelling construction overall is responding to low interest rates much as it always has done. 4.2 Consumption and the behaviour of borrowers and savers What about the effect of low interest rates on household consumption? This can be modelled in a simple way by linking household consumption to disposable income and household wealth. In such a model, lower interest rates affect consumption indirectly by increasing household disposable income and boosting both housing and equity prices.8 This simple model (like the DSGE model results I discussed) provides some tentative evidence that consumption growth has been a bit weaker over recent years than suggested by historical experience. Much of that history, however, captures the period of adjustment to easier access to credit from the early 1990s to the mid 2000s. At that time, household indebtedness increased substantially and the saving ratio declined to be well below earlier norms (Graph 4).9 So in a way, the more recent experience could be regarded as the more standard response. Indeed, the behaviour of late appears more sustainable than that of the previous episode.10  One aspect of this change in behaviour is evident in households injecting equity into the housing stock over recent years. That is, their net new spending on housing assets has exceeded their borrowing secured over housing. This stands in stark contrast to the period of strong housing market conditions in the first half of the 2000s, which saw households withdrawing housing equity to help finance their consumption (Graph 5).11  As I just mentioned, the experience of recent years is characterised by slightly lower growth of consumption than might have been expected. However, the responsiveness of consumption to disposable incomes and wealth does not appear to have changed, at least in a statistically significant way. There are two possible explanations for this observation. First, the growth of consumption of late could be affected by factors other than the stance of monetary policy. Second, it may be that the strength of the various monetary policy transmissions channels affecting consumption has changed, but in ways that are difficult to identify using models of aggregate household behaviour. Although it is hard to be definitive, my sense is that both these explanations are likely to be true.                                                 8  Estimates of wealth effects tend to differ somewhat based on the exact data and methodology used in their estimation. Previous work by Bank staff suggests that households consume between 3 and 4 cents out of every extra dollar of housing wealth. For examples, see Dvornak N and M Kohler (2003), ‘Housing Wealth, Stock Market Wealth and Consumption: A Panel Analysis for Australia’, RBA Research Discussion Paper No 2003–07 and Windsor C, J Jääskelä and R Finlay (2013), ‘Home Prices and Household Spending’, RBA Research Discussion Paper No 2013–04. 9  See RBA (2014), Submission to the Financial System Inquiry, March, Chapter 2. 10  See Stevens G (2013), ‘Economic Policy after the Booms’, Address to The Anika Foundation Luncheon, Sydney, 30 July. 11  For a description of housing equity withdrawal, see Schwartz C, T Hampton, C Lewis and D Norman (2006), ‘A Survey of Housing Equity Withdrawal and Injection in Australia’, RBA Research Discussion Paper No 2006–08. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Let me start with changes affecting the cash-flow channel. Net interest payments of households are now more responsive to changes in interest rates than they were a decade or more ago (at least in the short term). To illustrate the magnitude of this, we can estimate the effects of a 100 basis point reduction in the cash rate on net interest payments (as a share of household disposable incomes; Graph 6).12  There has been a noticeable increase in households’ holdings of interest-earning assets (such as bank deposits) over recent years (Graph 7). But despite this, a reduction in interest rates still lowers households’ net interest payments, and by much more than was the case in earlier decades. This larger response reflects the substantial increase in housing credit from the early 1990s to the mid 2000s. By itself, the greater responsiveness of net interest payments implies that the cash-flow channel should be stronger now than it was previously. Other things equal, we might have expected that the stronger effect of interest rates on the average household’s cash flows, and the operation of the other channels of monetary policy, would have encouraged a more noticeable rise in debt and a larger increase in current consumption in response to very low interest rates. Yet household indebtedness has been relatively stable for some years now (Graph 7 and Graph 9). While low interest rates may have helped to support consumption and debt, other forces appear to have been working in the opposite direction. Moreover, the response of consumption and indebtedness will depend on how different types of households are responding to these forces. Let me make this clearer with some examples. Some households may have revised down their expectations for income growth and may also be more uncertain about their incomes. This would be consistent with the substantial decline in wage growth and the rise in the unemployment rate over the past few years.13 This could have caused some households to have become uncomfortable with the levels of debt that they had been carrying. Accordingly, many households may have decided to pay down their debts faster than they would have in a world of unchanged expectations about incomes, thereby contributing to a period of weaker consumption growth. In such an environment, lower interest rates help to facilitate ‘deleveraging’, hastening the time at which those households will feel more secure about their financial situation. There is evidence of many households behaving in this way. In particular, the rate of mortgage prepayments has increased as interest rates have fallen and more households are well ahead of their required schedule of repayments (Graph 8).14, 15 Also, if we deduct funds held in mortgage offset accounts and ignore investor credit, we can see that the rest of household credit has declined by about 4 percentage points as a share of household disposable income since early 2010. This is consistent with a degree of deleveraging among some households, particularly when we consider that low interest rates                                                 12  This chart estimates the reaction of cash flows to the cash rate change within a month. Since a larger share of deposit rates are fixed than are loan rates, this will overstate the effect on cash flows over longer time horizons, though the extent of this bias has not necessarily changed over time in an obvious way. 13  Jacobs D and A Rush (2015), ‘Why is Wage Growth So Low?’, RBA Bulletin, June, forthcoming. 14  A lack of data means that we cannot make comparisons to earlier easing phases when indebtedness was lower. 15  Another factor potentially muting the response of consumption to interest rate changes relates to banks’ processes for adjusting scheduled mortgage repayments following changes in lending rates. Some banks do not decrease scheduled mortgage repayments when interest rates decrease. This means that even though the interest component of the repayment has declined, the total repayment is the same, resulting in many borrowers automatically making excess principal repayments. See Thurner M-O and A Dwyer (2013), ‘Partial Mortgage Prepayments and Housing Credit Growth’, RBA Bulletin, September, pp 31–38. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  might otherwise have encouraged a general increase in this type of credit over that period (Graph 9).16 What about those households that rely on interest-bearing assets? Their disposable incomes are lower than otherwise given the sizeable decline in interest rates.17 Accordingly, such households may be reluctant to maintain consumption by either running down their pool of liquid assets, or accessing capital gains they may have enjoyed on any housing or equities that they hold. Such behaviour would contribute to the growth of aggregate consumption being less responsive to a decline in interest rates than in the past. Finally, let’s consider those households with some spare funds to invest. The very low level of interest rates may have prompted such households to search for yield. Many of these households have combined those spare funds with new debt to purchase housing for the purposes of investment. Indeed, the strong growth of investor housing loans has driven the growth in household debt (as a share of disposable incomes) over recent years and contributed to a rise in both housing prices and dwelling construction. While this may not directly contribute to a rise in consumption of households undertaking the investment, it will support overall economic activity nonetheless. Conclusions Monetary policy is clearly working to support demand, although it is working against some strong headwinds. These include the significant decline in mining investment, fiscal consolidation at state and federal levels and the exchange rate, which continues to offer less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy. Model estimates that control for these and other forces provide tentative evidence that the monetary policy transmission mechanism, in aggregate, is about as effective as usual. However, it may be too early to pick up a statistically significant change using such models. As usual, dwelling construction is growing strongly in response to low interest rates, and this is making some contribution to the growth of aggregate demand and employment. It may be that in parts of the country, any further substantial increases in residential construction activity might run up against some supply constraints, putting further upward pressure on housing prices. As the Bank has noted for some time now, large increases of housing prices, if accompanied by strong growth of credit and a relaxation of lending standards, are a potential risk for economic stability. Accordingly, the Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain such risks that may arise from the housing market. Consumption growth has picked up since 2013. But it is still a little weaker than suggested by historical experience. This may reflect a number of factors including some variation in the ways that the different channels of monetary policy are affecting households according to their stage in life. Some indebted households appear to be taking advantage of low interest rates to pay down their debts faster than has been the norm, perhaps in response to weaker prospects for income growth. Those relying on interest receipts may feel compelled to constrain their consumption in response to the relatively long period of very low interest rates. Meanwhile, the search for yield is no doubt playing a role in driving the strong growth of investor housing credit. This might provide some indirect support to aggregate demand, but this channel is not without risk.                                                 16  From mid 2010 to mid 2012, about half of the decline in the dashed line in Graph 9 owed to lower owner-occupier housing credit (net of offset accounts), but since then it has returned to about the same level as it was five years ago (as a share of disposable income). 17  For further discussion of this issue, see Connolly E, F Fleming and J Jääskelä (2012), ‘Households’s Interest-bearing Assets‘, RBA Bulletin, December, pp 23’32. 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In short, monetary policy is working. The transmission mechanism may have changed in some respects, and this could help to explain lower-than-expected growth of consumption and debt of late. But it is hard to be too definitive. To know more about this, it would be helpful to better understand the behaviours of different types of households using household-level data. To use a botanical analogy, to know more about a plant, it’s helpful to observe how its different types of cells work.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mark Carney: Building real markets for the good of the people Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House, London, 10 June 2015. *      *      * I am grateful to Ben Nelson, Iain de Weymarn, Nicola Anderson, Alex Brazier, Andrew Hauser, Chris Salmon and Tim Taylor for their assistance in preparing this speech and accompanying Open Forum document. My Lord Mayor, Lady Mayoress, Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Almost 350 years ago, the Great Fire destroyed the City of London and rendered 100,000 people homeless. It took half a century to rebuild. The legacy of the Great Fire endures, including such Wren masterpieces as St Paul’s and his twenty-five other steeples that survive today within the City’s precincts. But the Fire’s legacy is not limited to how the City looks, it extends to what the City does. The blaze led Nicholas Barbon to establish the first insurance company, an innovation to fulfil a social need: the sharing of risk. Public authorities complemented private initiative. There was a Royal Proclamation that set standards for wider roads and houses built from brick and stone instead of timber. And Parliament passed the Parish Pump Act to prevent “mischiefs that may happen by fire” by establishing fire brigades and improving water supply. So that spark in Pudding Lane ignited much more besides the Great Fire itself: – the provision of liquidity to limit contagion; – a recognition that clear, well-understood codes contribute to the greater good; and – a belief that financial markets can solve real world problems. From the coffee houses that served as meeting places for entrepreneurs and merchants; to the exchanges that supported the trading of financial claims; to a central bank that acted as lender of last resort: a rich infrastructure developed to support markets that served the UK and the world. As it grew into the world’s leading economic and trading power, the UK also became its centre of financial capitalism. By the early 20th century, though no longer the world’s largest economy, the UK was still its hub of international finance. It held close to a half of the world’s stock of overseas investments and traded one third of all negotiable instruments. The City has retained its pre-eminence through market innovation. From eurobonds to emerging market debt, credit derivatives and centralised clearing; the City has continually created new financial products and markets to serve the real economy. Today the City remains the leading global financial centre. The UK is the venue for 40% of foreign exchange trading volume, half of all trades in OTC interest rate derivatives, and more than two-thirds of trading in international bonds. More international banking activity is booked in London than anywhere else, and the UK is host to the world’s third largest insurance sector as well as its second largest asset management industry. UK markets matter for global commerce. But above all, our markets matter for our prosperity. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Markets are a major part of the UK economy. 350,000 people are employed in financial services in London alone, and 1 million across the UK as a whole. Across the country, their enterprise contributes £130 billion to our national income and £70 billion to our exports. On current trends, the UK-based non-bank financial system would increase from around six times UK GDP to nearly fifteen times by 2050. Most fundamentally, our markets serve our real economy. By financing firms to hire, invest and expand, our markets help drive UK growth. By opening up cross-border trade and investment, our markets create new opportunities for UK businesses and savers. By transferring risks to those most willing and able to bear them, our markets help UK households and businesses insure against the unexpected. Much of this activity depends on fixed income, currency and commodity markets. These FICC markets establish the borrowing costs of households, companies and governments. They set the exchange rates we use when we travel or buy goods from abroad. They determine the costs of our food and raw materials. And they help our companies manage the financial risks they incur when investing, producing and trading. Markets have become ever more important to people as they bear increasing responsibility for financing their retirements and insuring against risks. The suitability of those decisions will depend heavily on FICC markets. It is therefore vital that they work well. And are seen to do so. The failures of FICC markets Though markets can be powerful drivers of prosperity, markets can go wrong. Left unattended, they are prone to instability, excess and abuse. Markets without the right standards or infrastructure are like cities without building codes, fire brigades or insurance. Poor infrastructure allowed the spark of the US subprime crisis to light a powder keg under UK markets, triggering the worst recession in our lifetimes. – Poor “soft” infrastructure such as codes of conduct that too few read and too many ignored. – Faulty “hard” infrastructure like interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks that were quite literally fixed; and – Weak banks whose light capital and heavy reliance on short-term funding created a tinder box. Central banks shared in these failings, operating a system of fire insurance whose ambiguity was anything but constructive when global markets were engulfed in flames. The Bank of England’s general approach was consistent with the attitude of FICC markets, which historically relied heavily on informal codes and understandings. That informality was well suited to an earlier age. But as markets innovated and grew, it proved wanting. Most troubling have been the numerous incidents of misconduct that exploited such informality, undercutting public trust and threatening systemic stability. This has had direct economic consequences. Mistrust between market participants has raised borrowing costs and reduced credit availability. Falling confidence in market resilience has meant companies have held back productive investments. And uncertainty has meant 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  people have hesitated to move job or home. These effects are not trivial, and they have reduced the dynamism of our economy in the post-crisis years.1 Widespread mistrust has also had deeper, indirect costs. Markets are not ends in themselves, but powerful means for prosperity and security for all. As such they need to retain the consent of society – a social licence – to be allowed to operate, innovate and grow. Repeated episodes of misconduct have called that social licence into question. We have all been let down by these developments. And we all share responsibility for fixing them. Real markets I believe everyone in this room would agree: we need real markets for sustainable prosperity. Not markets that collapse when there is a shock from abroad. Not markets where transactions occur in chat rooms. Not markets where no one appears accountable for anything. Real markets are professional and open, not informal and clubby. Participants in real markets compete on merit rather than collude online. Real markets are resilient, fair and effective. They maintain their social licence. Real markets don’t just happen; they depend on the quality of market infrastructure. Robust market infrastructure is a public good, one in constant danger of under-provision because the best markets innovate continually. This inherent risk can only be managed if all market actors, public and private, recognise their responsibilities for the system as a whole. The City has a special responsibility given London’s pre-eminent position in global markets, which is why it has already brought so many ideas and such energy to advance financial reform.2 Financial reform is re-building real markets Reform is strengthening the resilience of major banks. Their capital requirements have increased ten-fold and their liquid assets are up four-fold. These banks’ trading assets are down by a third and intra-bank exposures by two-thirds. Reform is ending the scourge of Too Big To Fail. The combination of eliminating the implicit public subsidy and increased capitalisation will correct the distortions caused by the structural under-pricing of risk on banks’ balance sheets. And by making a further shift to market-based finance inevitable, it is increasing choice and competition – real market forces. Reform is also improving risk transfer by untangling the complex web of derivatives that meant failures like Lehman triggered chaos; and by creating simple, transparent and comparable securitisation markets. This reform agenda has increased the effectiveness of FICC markets and reinforced their social licence.                                                 1 See Haddow, A, Hare, C, Hooley, J and Shakir, T (2013) “Macroeconomic uncertainty: what is it, how can we measure it and why does it matter?”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q2. See also Bloom, N, et al (2014), “Really uncertain business cycles”, mimeo. 2  Examples include the contribution of the private sector to: the development of revised ISDA protocols as part of efforts to tackle Too Big To Fail; improvements in disclosure under the aegis of the Enhanced Disclosure Taskforce; consultation over TLAC proposals; the establishment of the Banking Standards Council; and on-going work to develop the appropriate near-risk free reference rate for sterling markets. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It is frustrating for us all that such major progress risks being overshadowed by misconduct problems. The fair and effective markets review We must break the back of these issues, and the Fair and Effective Markets Review shows the way forward. With its publication today, all the main building blocks are now in place for the real markets we need. I want to pay tribute to my colleagues Charles Roxburgh, Minouche Shafik and Martin Wheatley, who so ably led the Review. And to salute Elizabeth Corley, who so expertly chaired the Review’s independent Market Practitioner panel, canvassing and coalescing views from across the industry. The importance and complexity of their task is illustrated by the multiple root causes of the misconduct in FICC markets. Specifically, the Review identifies: – Market structures which presented specific opportunities for abuse, such as poor benchmark design, and which more generally were vulnerable to conflicts of interest, collusion, and thin markets; – Standards of acceptable market practice that were usually poorly understood, often ignored and always lacked teeth; – Firms’ systems of internal governance and control that were incapable of asserting the interests of firms – let alone the wider market – over those of close-knit trading staff; – Individual incentives that were skewed, with pay packages stressing short-term returns overlong-term value and good conduct; – And personal accountability that was lacking, with a culture of impunity developing in parts of the market. All these factors contributed to an ethical drift. Unethical behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and eventually became the norm. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the system nor recognised the full impact of their actions. For too many, the City stopped at its gates, though its influence extended far beyond. A good start has been made in addressing these deficiencies. The design and regulation of key FICC benchmarks has been overhauled and transparency in FICC markets is being enhanced. Compensation rules have, in the main, been transformed to align better risk and reward. From next year, senior managers of banks and insurers will be held directly accountable for failures in their areas of responsibility. And the best firms are improving the “tone from the top”, launching conduct training and revamping control structures. But major gaps remain. These are evidenced by enforcement actions which continue to appear with depressing frequency. These sanctions, while necessary, aren’t the solution, not least since the $150 billion of fines levied on global banks translates into more than $3 trillion of reduced lending capacity to the real economy. We need a better balance between individual and firm accountability. But who should be accountable? Against which standards? And with what consequences? In these regards, I welcome the Review’s recommendations that: 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  First, individuals must be held to account. Doing so requires new, common standards, cast in clear language; better training and qualifications for FICC personnel; and mechanisms to ensure that when individuals are fired, their history will be known to those who consider hiring them. Second, firms must take greater responsibility for the system by improving the quality, clarity and market-wide understanding of FICC trading practices. I welcome the industry’s leadership in drawing up plans for a new FICC Market Standards Board. The Board’s mandate will be to establish readily understandable standards, keep them up-to-date with market developments, and promote adherence to them. Crucially, the Board will be dynamic, and will monitor and address areas of uncertainty in specific trading practices. This is a major opportunity for the industry to establish common standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and, crucially, that keep pace with markets. If firms and their staff fail to take this opportunity, more restrictive regulation is inevitable. To give these measures teeth, key elements of the Senior Managers Regime should be extended to all firms active in wholesale FICC markets, including dealers and asset managers. That means all senior managers would have clearly defined responsibilities and would be answerable for training, certifying and monitoring the material risk takers they supervise. The FCA should oversee compliance, redeploying resources to focus on Senior Persons. In turn, these individuals would be on the hook for promoting compliance within their organisations. Incentives will be aligned. For the best in the industry, this won’t be new. This is just how you run your business. But for others, who free ride on your reputations: the Age of Irresponsibility is over. Third, regulators should extend the coverage of market abuse regulation to include every major fixed income and currency market. And criminal sanctions should be updated, with market abuse rules similarly extended and maximum prison terms lengthened. Finally we need global standards for global markets. I welcome the FICC Markets Standards Board’s intent to be as global as possible in its membership and influence. All major Central Banks and market participants have begun working on developing a new single Global Code for FX. I would encourage IOSCO to consider complementing these efforts with a similar initiative to cover FICC markets as a whole when they meet in London next week. The FSB will engage with these processes and work to improve the alignment between remuneration and conduct risk across the globe. The Bank of England’s role All must play a role in building real markets, including the Bank of England. Although the Bank does not regulate conduct or markets per se, it has responsibilities for, and powers over, the stability of the UK’s financial system as a whole. In the run-up to the crisis, the Bank’s contribution to the effectiveness of markets fell short in three respects. In all cases, the Bank is now responding. First, the Bank’s framework for providing liquidity was shown to have lagged behind market developments. Once under pressure, the Bank could neither stabilise overnight rates nor support the banking system. Fortunately, in the jaws of the crisis, the Bank innovated rapidly and admirably to avoid a collapse of the system. Those lessons are now embedded in a new, comprehensive framework for the Bank’s sterling market operations. We have expanded the range of eligible collateral, and will lend to many more counterparties, at much longer maturities. The Bank also stands ready to act as a market maker of last resort. Constructive Ambiguity has been replaced by Open for Business. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Second, like many others, the Bank neither identified the scale of risks in the system nor spotted the gaps in the regulatory architecture. Following the Chancellor’s reforms in the last Parliament, the Bank now has statutory responsibility to protect and enhance the stability of the UK’s financial system, and is working as One Bank to do so. The FPC and the PRA have catalysed a series of actions that influence market resilience including stress tests of banks and hedge funds, system-wide capital actions, and new tools like the leverage ratio and minimum repo haircuts.3 Third, the Bank’s arcane governance blurred the Bank’s accountability and, by extension, weakened the social licence of markets. Before my arrival, the Bank’s governance was reshaped. The Bank’s board of directors, Court, has been strengthened. Its external members now have formal powers to observe the meetings of the Bank’s policy committees and to commission reviews into the Bank’s performance.4 I welcome the Government’s intention to introduce legislation further strengthening the governance and accountability of the Bank. The Bank will continue to modernise its operations. Following the Grabiner report, the Bank has focused its Market Intelligence programme, strengthened procedures, improved training and overhauled compliance. And the Bank is introducing today a new code of conduct. The Bank expects its senior management to meet the highest standards of professional conduct. As one example, the Bank will apply the core principles of the Senior Managers Regimes to its own senior staff, including the Governor. This is in addition to existing obligations and scrutiny from Court, Parliament, the media and the general public. And the Bank will continue to reinforce its commitment to openness and transparency. Minutes of Court meetings are now published with minimal delay. The Monetary Policy Committee will publish transcripts of its deliberations with an appropriate lag. Whenever there are difficult issues, outside reviews of the Bank’s performance will be conducted, publicly released and acted upon. Looking ahead The Bank welcomes such scrutiny of our activities, including open debate about the cumulative impact of reform on the functioning of markets. In particular, while the core of the system has been made more resilient, the combination of new prudential requirements on dealers and structural changes in markets has reduced market depth and increased potential volatility. This process likely has further to run, particularly as the normalisation of global monetary conditions edges closer. Firms and regulators should be alert to these developments, including their consequences for investment funds that offer daily liquidity while investing in securities that only appear liquid. To be clear, more expensive liquidity is a price well worth paying for making the core of the system more robust. Removing public subsidies is absolutely necessary for real markets to exist. Volatility characterises such real markets and much of the pre-crisis market making capacity among dealers was ephemeral. However, the possibility of sharp, unpredictable changes in market liquidity poses a clear risk to financial stability, particularly when some                                                 3 See, inter alia, the Record of the FPC meeting held on 20th November 2013, which summarises the outcome of joint work with the FCA on “snap-back” risk; Bank of England (2014), “Stress testing the UK banking system: 2014 results”, December; Bank of England (2014), “The Financial Policy Committee’s review of the leverage ratio”, October. 4 Including from a new independent evaluation office that reports directly to the non-executive Chairman. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  market participants take liquidity for granted and crowd into trades in anticipation of central bank action. The Bank is keenly alert to such risks. The FPC and the FSB are currently analysing these issues and welcome perspectives on whether the market, regulation or both should adjust for the good of the system. Conclusion With the main building blocks of reform in place, now is the time to take stock. It’s vital that we – public authorities and private market participants – work together to reverse the tide of ethical drift. This cannot be a one-off exercise. We need continuous engagement so that market infrastructure keeps pace with market innovation. That’s why the Bank is announcing that it will hold an Open Forum this Autumn which will bring together all stakeholders in FICC markets. Our goal is to discuss the prospects for market functioning, where regulations might overlap or conflict, and whether enough has been done to build the real markets the UK deserves. To prompt an open discussion, we are publishing a detailed paper which reviews these issues and draws out such questions.5 Everyone has an interest in the future of financial markets, so I would strongly encourage you to engage with our Open Forum process online and at the conference itself. An Open and Accountable Bank welcomes your input. Our response to recent failings should be as ambitious as those of our predecessors to the Great Fire: renewed prosperity built on private markets and public market infrastructure. Let our legacy be the earthly equivalent of Wren’s ethereal genius, real markets so that the City can do what it does best: transact and innovate for the good of the people of the United Kingdom and the world. Thank you.                                                 5 See http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/openforum.aspx. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Prasarn Trairatvorakul: Thai economy – tapping the untapped opportunity Speech by Dr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the inauguration of the RMB Clearing Bank in Thailand and 5th year celebration of the ICBC (Thai), Bangkok, 22 April 2015. *      *      * 1. Your Excellency Ambassador Ning Fukui, Chairman Jiang, Chairman Hu, Dr. Zhigang Li, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the invitation to give a few remarks on the occasion of the inauguration of ICBC (Thai) as the official Renminbi clearing bank here in Thailand. 2. This development of the RMB Clearing Bank in Thailand and certainly also to celebrate the 5th Anniversary of ICBC (Thai) is in fact the result of the long and continued ties between China and Thailand. It has marked another important step in further development of our financial ties following the signing of the Renminbi – Thai Baht Bilateral Swap Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding with the People’s Bank of China on the establishment of the Renminbi Clearing Arrangements in December 2014. 3. Today, I was invited to talk about Thai economy. So I am pleased to have the opportunity to share with you some of my observations on the current state of the Thai economy. Let me humbly start from some of the challenges we are facing, the economy is currently reeling from both internal and external headwinds. Internally, the stagnant technology and labour readiness has so far taken a toll on Thailand’s economic expansion. Also, the improvement of domestic consumption and investment are slow due to a cautious private sector’s confidence. Externally, Thai economy is affected by the current uneven recovery of global economy which hinders Thai export growth. However, Thai economy is expected to recover up to 3.8% GDP growth this year from a mere 0.8% last year. Private consumption and the government expenditures will play key roles for 2015 outlook. 4. On the bright side, Thailand has been riding on the back of China’s economic prosperity. In other words, the regional prospect has pinned on improvement in intra-regional trades of goods and services. China’s economic figures may be somewhat lower than its historical average, as a result of the sluggish recovery of the global demand and the continued structural reform in China. However, China growth rate is still at a satisfactorily high level. And China has yet remained an important engine in support of the growth of the Thai export sector. For the past few years, Thailand has become one of the most popular destinations among Chinese tourists, thanks to popularity of the ‘Lost in Thailand’ movie. Each week, hundreds of flights between Thailand and China have been landed to accommodate the increasing interest of Chinese visitors. We value this considerably as it not only helps boost the tourism and services sector of the Thai economy, but also tightens our cultural connections. 5. As we all know, Chinese economy has become a necessary ingredient for our secret recipe for the past decade. Since China has been an important economic partner of Thailand and the region. To further strengthen these flows of trades and investments, close financial cooperation is the key. The Renminbi / Baht Bilateral Swap Agreement (or BSA in short) and the establishment of the Renminbi Clearing Bank here in Bangkok are the great examples. 6. The BSA is designed to be a backstop liquidity facility, which will help boost confidence of the private sector in using the local currency in trade and investment settlement. After the first signing of the BSA in 2010, the use of the Chinese Renminbi in trade and investment settlement between Thailand and China has grown remarkably. The share of trade settlement in Renminbi quadruples between 2010 and 2014. As for investment 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  settlement, the share climbs up dramatically from a mere 1% in 2010 to 14% in 2014. In spite of the rapid increases, the volumes are still small compared to other major currencies. 7. The Renminbi Clearing bank is the next important step from the BSA. Its Renminbi settlement mechanism is the sequencing plan of the Renminbi scalability. I could see its merit which fundamentally paves the way for further Renminbi internationalization as well as the role of Renminbi in global financial markets that will become increasingly prominent in the near future. 8. There is, however, some room for improvement in order to realize the full economic benefits between Thailand and China. With this regard, we need to further promote financial cooperation and more trade and investment facility arrangements such as today’s initiative. Ladies and gentlemen, 9. I would like to emphasize that there are still untapped opportunities abound along the whole spectrum of exchanges and cooperation between Thailand and China. As to give you food for thought, the followings, are a few examples. Firstly, regional supply chain network. Our region has already been regarded as high quality and cost-effective production bases. However, there is still gap to be filled and opportunity to be grasped. Since many economies in the region are not well integrated into the regional production networks. According to the latest World Bank’s Trading Cross Borders indicator which measures the time and cost of trading across borders, the newer member of ASEAN all score well below the ASEAN average. This is mainly due to the huge gaps in infrastructure. 10. Here, we can narrow the gap by mobilizing our region’s abundant financial resources into infrastructure investment. In this regard, China plays a strategic role in the progression of infrastructure development in our region. The improved infrastructure will allow regional economies at various stages of development to participate in regional production networks in line with their evolving comparative advantage. Infrastructure investment is costly but it is worth the expense. 11. Secondly, research and technical development. Although China has emerged into the world centre stage in just recent decades, China is now a world class technology lab who owns the broad range of advanced technologies. These range from the “Maglev” train in Shanghai to the supercomputer “Tianhe-2” which is ranked as the world’s fastest computing system in 2014. Thailand, on the other hand, is currently facing technology bottleneck which has taken a toll on Thailand’s competitiveness and growth. According to the UNESCO, Thailand’s combined public and private investment in research and development (R&D) is around 0.25 percent of GDP which falls behind China’s 1.7 percent. 12. Arrays of China development plans are coincided with Thailand’s research interest. According to China’s Medium to Long-Term Plan for Development of Science and Technology (2006 – 2020), China’s topics of strategic research include (1) agriculture science (2) green technology and (3) public health. These topics are in line with the agendas of Thailand’s National Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Master Plan. This provides opportunities for joint scientific works based on common interests and medium-term visions. Thailand could leverage on China experiences and knowhow through technology transfer. In this light, Thailand could step ahead at the faster pace to achieve her goals. This is yet another great complement to tap. 13. Lastly, Thailand as gateway to ASEAN. Thailand is strategically positioned at the heart of the ASEAN region with relatively well-developed infrastructure as reflected in the World Bank’s latest Logistics Performance Index. Thailand has, therefore, been a natural gateway that links extra-regional economies to ASEAN markets. Thailand has advantages to be a hub for regional headquarters of multinational companies; a hub for logistics and distribution activities; a sourcing hub for regional markets; and a financial hub for regional markets. However, to remain competitive as a regional hub is a challenging task. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  14. To remain as the preferred hub and entry point of the region, we perceive an opportunity for investment from China which has the advantage in capital, construction capacity and technology. As the advantage of low cost factor of productions is rapidly declining, China is facing an urgent need to re-orient supply chains through Thailand to enter ASEAN and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in particular. China and Thailand should therefore make every effort to grasp this opportunity and construct win-win solutions for both sides. Ladies and gentlemen, 15. Let me conclude that China economic prosperity and advancement provides wide range of untapped opportunities for Thailand. They are right here where we are now, in our region. We should seize it and not miss it. And I am confident that so long as we work hand in hand with China, unite together, and embrace the merit of economic integration, the synergy of the two will surely give its fruit on the growing tree. Thank you.

Recent capital market developments The recent volatility in the bond markets reminded me of James Carville, an advisor of Bill Clinton, who once said: “I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter, but now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” Bond investors, at least the ones who were wrong-footed, were certainly intimidated by the most recent jump in bond yields. To understand the underlying decline in bond prices, which was dubbed the “Bund tantrum” because German Bunds were at the epicentre of the mini-crash, one has to bear in mind the preceding rally, which had been triggered to a large extent by the Eurosystem’s sovereign bond purchase programme. Expectations of a large-scale QE programme depressed long-term interest rates even before the purchases actually began. However, somewhat surprisingly, interest rates dropped still further to unprecedented low levels when the purchase programme kicked off in March. It was a development which many attributed to what they saw as the decisive implementation of the programme, but it was also linked to the gradual emergence of the consequences of some programme details. Yields on German Bunds with maturities of up to eight years had fallen below zero, suggesting that a certain degree of exuberance was in the air. These developments, fuelled by economic news on both sides of the Atlantic, drove up the number of bond investors who doubted the sustainability of such low yields. The German FAZ daily newspaper commented on the shift in sentiment: “Some people who just a few weeks ago regarded negative yields as a sign of a serious crisis are now seeing rising yields as signalling a serious crisis, too.” In my opinion, the most recent rise in yields can be largely explained as a correction of a market overshooting – a kind of re-normalisation. Liquidity might have been an issue, too. With bond prices falling and many investors caught off guard, there appears to have been little appetite for taking long positions in bonds. For what it’s worth, the current level of bond market volatility is not exceptionally high. Indeed, it has been unusually low over the past year. So these market movements are a rather welcome development insofar as they help to foster risk awareness. What this episode illustrates most of all is that central banks currently have a significant impact on capital markets, as they have become the dominant market player. Yet they are not fully in control of long-term interest rates, try as they might in striving to fulfil their monetary policy mandates. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  But this episode also shows that the financial system was able to cope with these market movements. The ultimate goal of QE is to accelerate inflation in the euro area and to bring the inflation rate into line with our definition of price stability. According to this definition, euro-area inflation should be below but close to 2% over the medium term. You don’t need me to tell you that I was, and I still am, one of the sceptics regarding purchases of sovereign bonds in the euro area. Having outlined my arguments on many occasions, for example at a City of London event in February, I will be brief today. In a nutshell, I had my doubts about the need for a large-volume QE programme and, against this backdrop, I see risks and unintended side-effects that might outweigh the benefits in terms of an accelerated normalisation of inflation. While the current inflation rate is significantly below our target, this was driven mainly by a positive supply-side shock caused by lower energy prices. As there were no signs of second-round effects, the risk of deflation was very low indeed. So, an acceleration of the inflation rate was already in the cards, with or without QE – with QE, certainly faster. This benefit had to be traded against the risks: Central banks are set to become the euro-area member states’ biggest creditors. When governments become accustomed to the favourable financing conditions, this could dampen their willingness to consolidate their budgets and implement structural reforms. And it could make governments more keen to try to prevent the ECB from terminating its ultra-easy monetary policy. At the end of the day, this could jeopardise central bank independence, undermining our ability to maintain price stability. It can be generally said that monetary policymakers are increasingly being called upon to step in and take action. Let me mention just two items from the wish lists: 1. Keep the Greek financial system afloat by providing emergency liquidity and, thus, help prevent the Greek government from defaulting. 2. Protect economies from the negative outcomes of a supposed era of “secular stagnation” by adopting a more activist monetary policy stance. Central banks, and this is not unique to the Eurosystem, run the risk of being overburdened. Thus, I think that one of the core issues for monetary policy going forward is finding the right definition of the boundaries of monetary policy. It is clear that monetary policy can stimulate the economy in the short run. What it cannot do, however, is deliver sustainable growth. Metaphorically speaking, if you have a rowing boat and one of the oars is broken, it is better to try to fix that oar than to paddle with the remaining one. In other words, successful monetary policy hinges on factors that it cannot fully determine by itself. One key factor is a stability-oriented framework. Such a framework ensures sound public finances and sustainable economic growth. It is a framework that fosters responsible political decisions by anchoring the principle of liability – that is to say, those who take decisions should be accountable for their consequences. And this is particularly relevant in a monetary union. In this vein, it is important not to further undermine the no-bail-out rule of the European Treaty. Solidarity can only be expected if conditionality is accepted. Otherwise, the root causes of the problems will not be addressed. I imagine you can guess that I am talking about the ongoing negotiations with Greece. There is a strong determination to help Greece improve its public administration, remove barriers to growth and put public finances on a sustainable path. And taxpayers from other 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  euro-area countries have provided substantial funds to support the unavoidable adjustment processes. But time is running out, and the risk of insolvency is increasing by the day. The contagion effects of such a scenario are certainly better contained than they were in the past, though they should not be underestimated. But the main losers in that scenario would be Greece and the Greek people. What I would like to stress here is that an erosion of the principles of monetary union also has consequences for the Eurosystem and the monetary union that no one should downplay. 3. Economic developments Recent growth figures for the global economy have been rather disappointing. Growth dynamics have dampened, not least in major emerging economies. The US economy contracted in the first quarter of this year due to a brief spell of poor weather. And the UK economy has also seen its growth rate shrink. The lower oil price is proving to be less of a driving force for the global economy than had been anticipated. The moderate recovery in the euro area is ongoing, however, and the economy has picked up further momentum. The latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area see annual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.0% in 2017. The German economy has recovered more quickly than expected from the cyclical lull in the middle of last year and has returned to a growth path that is underpinned by both domestic and foreign demand. Domestic economic activity is benefiting from the favourable labour market situation and the substantial increases in income. Although foreign trade is currently being hampered by dampening global dynamics, it is simultaneously being buoyed by the euro’s depreciation and the strengthening cyclical recovery in the euro area. The Bundesbank’s economists expect Germany’s real GDP to grow by 1.7% this year, 1.8% in 2016 and 1.5% in 2017. A puzzling feature of the German economy is the divergence of business investment and employment, all the more so given that financing conditions are extraordinarily favourable. The weak level of business investment might be explained by the high degree of uncertainty over external developments, but it might also point to an anticipated future shortage of skilled labour. In other words: ageing tones down investment. 4. Making Europe more prosperous The wait-and-see stance adopted by many German enterprises is motivated not least by the modest economic outlook for the euro area. Boosting growth in the euro area, then, needs to be the top priority. This would not only help the crisis countries to overcome their very difficult economic situation but also benefit all the other member states. To get to grips with the crisis, it is crucial for the troubled economies to press ahead with their adjustment process. That includes shoring up public finances (in line with the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact); deleveraging the private sector; implementing structural reforms and boosting price competitiveness. This, by the way, also holds true for France. While the second-largest euro-area economy is obviously not a crisis country, it has nevertheless seen its competitiveness contract, and its public finances are in bad shape. Moreover, France needs to act as a role model for smaller economies. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The German economy is much better positioned in this respect – the public budget is running a surplus, private debt is acceptable, labour market and social reforms in the last decade have contributed to lower unemployment and to reducing the burden on the social security systems; plus German enterprises are competitive in global markets. So everything is hunky-dory? Not at all. Germany’s economy may be in good shape right now, but we are not in a position to be complacent. Germany is facing stiff economic challenges, particularly from demographic change, which is also dragging on productivity growth. According to the EU Commission’s latest Ageing Report, Germany’s working-age population (people between 15 and 64) will shrink by 28% by the year 2060 compared with a drop of 8% in the rest of the European Union. In France, meanwhile, the working-age population is expected to rise by 5%, in the UK by 11%. No wonder, then, that only two EU countries (crisis-ridden Greece and Portugal) are expected to see lower potential GDP growth between 2013 and 2060. And even in terms of per capita growth, Germany is mired in mediocrity by European standards, according to OECD projections. Yet I do not want to focus on Germany. I just wanted to make it plain that mobilising additional growth forces is a task facing the whole of Europe. After all, the title of my speech is “How to promote prosperity in Europe”. Some of you may remember the European Council’s Lisbon Agenda. It was set out in the year 2000 and aimed “to make Europe, by 2010, the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion”. Well, obviously, the European leaders were inspired by the Italian artist Michelangelo, who is quoted as saying: “The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.” Given the apparent failure of this strategy and in the face of an unprecedented crisis, the goals set out in its successor, “Europe 2020”, are somewhat less ambitious: the priorities of “Europe 2020” are “smart, sustainable and inclusive growth”. However, stronger growth does not come by declaration. Rather, growth-friendly measures are required – and that particularly means measures that bolster functioning markets. Incidentally, growth-friendly measures would also help to mitigate the risk of the UK leaving the European Union. The benefits of European integration cannot be measured by net contributions to Brussels’ budget. The economic value goes far beyond that because Europe is not a zero-sum game but to the benefit of all – provided that it promotes competitive market structures which unleash innovative forces. If Europe were really heading for “smart, sustainable and inclusive growth”, it would gain attractiveness – not only but also for the UK. But as much as the UK gains from being part of the EU, so, too does the EU benefit from having the UK as a member. The EU is stronger today because of the UK’s contribution to it: The dynamics of the European economy owe a great deal to Britain’s commitment to open and flexible markets – a position which is very much in tune with the Bundesbank’s, I might add. In the remainder of my speech, I would like to share my thoughts on ways in which the European economy could become even more dynamic. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  4.1 Capital markets union Financial market fragmentation is certainly a hindrance to growth. Building a capital markets union (CMU), which is one of the European Commission’s top priorities, is therefore a step forward towards a more prosperous Europe. A properly designed and implemented CMU can also deliver greater economic and financial stability. From the Bundesbank’s viewpoint, CMU should in particular aim at fostering European equity markets. Corporate finance in Europe is still heavily reliant on debt, first and foremost bank loans. Taking GDP as a yardstick, the EU banking system is four times larger than its US counterpart. Conversely, equity capital plays a minor role. While the ratio of stock market capitalisation to bank credit to the private sector is well below one in all EU countries, in the US, the respective figure is about two. However, US enterprises not only benefit from having better access to equity capital. Equity holdings in the US are also much more widely dispersed than in Europe. Research has found that private risk sharing through integrated capital markets is a much more important shock absorber than public risk sharing. The integrated markets for equity capital in the US cushion around 40% of total cyclical fluctuations between federal states. If a negative shock hits an industry or a specific region, then this loss is spread widely beyond that region. Creditors, on the other hand, are not exposed to losses – except in the case of insolvency. In other words: equity is a shock absorber, debt is a shock amplifier. That’s yet another reason why we need to promote the integration of equity markets in Europe, too. This should also include venture capital. When it comes to providing capital to innovative firms, the EU has a lot of room for improvement. In the US, for instance, finding investors is not much of a problem for innovative companies. On average, an innovative US firm can attract significantly more capital than one in the major European countries. Dismantling national barriers and creating a European venture capital market would help fast-growing, fledgling enterprises to get better access to capital. While regulation has been harmonised to some extent, however, many crucial domains for venture capital funds, such as investor protection and insolvency law, remain fragmented. Hence, to exploit all economic advantages of a capital market union would imply more legal changes than currently proposed by the EU Commission. 4.2 Barriers to market entry Another obstacle that particularly stifles growth by business start-ups is red tape. Frequent administrative formalities, long approval periods or high fees make starting a business more complicated and expensive than it should be. Even though an enterprise’s direct costs may appear to be manageable at first glance, the economic cost of difficulties in entering the market and, as a result, weaker competition should not be underestimated. For example, studies indicate that the differences between the cost of entering the market in the USA and in the EU, though relatively small, could still account for 10% to 20% of the EU’s productivity shortfall. The costs of removing red tape are comparatively low and could help strengthen growth. This holds true for many European countries – not least for Germany, which ranks 106th in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum on the question “How 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  many procedures are required to start a business?” – alongside countries like Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Chad. 4.3 Market integration Even in the UK, I think, few would doubt that the single market has been a great success benefiting the entire EU. It has simplified trade in goods, intensifying competition and narrowing margins. Nevertheless, market integration remains incomplete. In the area of services, cross-border competition is under-developed. Mark-ups on the cost of services are, on average, higher than in the USA. One could say that the European Commission’s Services Directive has failed to live up to expectations. In a nutshell, the single market for services is not yet delivering its full potential. Thus, completing the single market for services and ensuring the unhindered cross-border provision of services promise significant economic benefits. As far as advancing digitalisation is concerned, we do not know exactly how the economic transformation towards greater digitalisation impacts on growth and taxation. But what we do know is that there are currently 28 separate digital markets in the EU. However, it is clear that the benefits of digitalisation can only be reaped if economies are flexible enough to adjust to changing business conditions. In Europe, the markets for digital applications are highly fragmented, especially with respect to legal issues such as the protection of privacy, content and copyright. The liability of online intermediaries, electronic payments and electronic contracts are also regulated differently. Harmonisation in terms of a digital single market (DSM) would certainly contribute to higher potential growth. According to a study by the European Parliament, a completed DSM could raise the long-run level of EU-28 GDP by 4%. And the European Commission, which recently presented its DSM strategy, expects the creation of 3.8 million jobs. Harmonising rules and regulations is relevant not just for trade in goods and services within the EU. Doing business with trading partners outside the EU is hampered to an even greater extent by red tape, the ongoing existence of tariffs and, above all, other trade barriers. In many cases, manufacturers have to produce two different versions of the same product to meet the respective requirements of the EU and US markets. This produces unnecessary costs with little benefit. A transatlantic free trade agreement between the world’s two largest economies would therefore further stimulate sustainable growth and job creation. 4.4 Flexible labour markets The most promising way to reap the benefits of innovation and technological change, however, is by implementing structural reforms aimed at creating greater labour market flexibility. Researchers have found that, compared to the US, innovative European firms find it more difficult to hire the staff they need. This drags on allocative efficiency and, ultimately, on productivity, too. If we want to mimic US productivity and drive unemployment down to acceptable levels, we need to modernise our labour markets. Overly strict employment protection exerts a “lock-in” effect: workers do not move easily from one firm to the next. That does not mean establishing a “hire and fire” system. Lower employment protection should be coupled with adequate financial support in the event of a job loss. Scandinavian countries have led the way with their “flexicurity” reforms and, fortunately, an increasing number of euro-area countries are following suit. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  4.5 Good infrastructure Just like flexible labour markets support growth, so too does good infrastructure. Conversely, infrastructure weaknesses can inhibit growth considerably. In this regard, it is often claimed that Germany should increase its infrastructure investment. Even in Germany, it is en vogue to complain about ailing infrastructure. The weekly magazine Der Spiegel, for example, last year published an issue entitled Der Bröckelstaat – “the crumbling state”. However, there are neither comparable international data nor any theoretical considerations suggesting that Germany is investing too little. In 2014, the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP in Germany was slightly up on the euro-area average and also higher than in the UK. Moreover, investment does not boost growth prospects per se. In fact, that would be putting the cart before the horse. Better prospects for growth, and therefore for profit, are the best incentive to invest. International surveys show that Germany is considered to have one of the best infrastructures in the world. The Global Competitiveness Report I mentioned earlier in my speech ranks Germany’s infrastructure in seventh place, just ahead of France, Spain, the UK and the US. And the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index even puts Germany’s infrastructure in first place worldwide. Having said that, I would not deny that there is some room for improvement in public investment, given that net investment has been negative for some time now. International comparisons suggest that German public investment is too low. This, however, should be taken with a pinch of salt. The ratio of public investment to GDP hinges on the role of the state in the economy, which differs widely across Europe. Provided that public funds are primarily invested in areas in which they will pay off, this improves the economic supply conditions and, in the long term, growth potential. However, it would be unnecessary and wrong to fund higher public infrastructure investment through new borrowing. Rather, it should be made possible by cutting consumptive expenditures. Calls for a deficit-financed economic stimulus in Germany are misplaced. In this regard, what former ECB chief economist Otmar Issing wrote in a Financial Times article last October still holds true to this day: “Imagine you are asked to give advice to a country on its economic policy. The country enjoys near-full employment; its growth is above or at least at full potential. There is no under-usage of resources – what economists call an output gap – and the government’s budget is balanced, but the debt level is far above target. To top it all, monetary policy is extremely loose. This is exactly the situation in Germany. (…) Where is the economic textbook that argues that such a country should run a deficit to stimulate the economy?” 5. Conclusion Let me conclude. My objective was to make it plain that monetary policy is the wrong addressee when it comes to promoting prosperity in Europe. It is still true that maintaining price stability is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to achieving sustained economic growth in the long run. Since I quoted James Carville earlier on, I would like to close by modifying his most famous phrase “It’s the economy, stupid.” into: It’s not monetary policy that provides prosperity. It’s forward-looking economic policy that sets the course for sustainable growth.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Glenn Stevens: Economic conditions and prospects – creating the upside Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Economic Society of Australia Luncheon, Brisbane, 10 June 2015. *      *      * I thank Elliott James for research assistance. Thank you for the invitation to speak in Brisbane once again. The last time I spoke with this group, in July 2013, the economy was estimated to be growing at about 2½ per cent.1 Underlying inflation was 2¼–2½ per cent, consistent with the target of 2–3 per cent. Two years on, the economy is growing at just shy of 2½ per cent and underlying inflation is around 2¼–2½ per cent, consistent with the target. In some respects, then, it might seem that not much has changed. In fact a number of important developments have occurred during that period, some as anticipated and some not. Overall, the fact that not much has changed is disappointing: the economy has not picked up speed as we had hoped. In this talk, I will make some observations about the global and domestic economies, and try to give some sense of what we have learned in the past couple of years. The global economy Two years ago, we judged Australia’s trading partner group to be growing at about its average pace of around 4 per cent. It was expected that during 2014 and 2015 growth in this group would pick up a bit, to a pace a little above average. In fact, growth for our trading partners has remained at about 4 per cent and is expected to stay there over the next couple of years. To be sure, 4 per cent growth is faster than growth for the world economy as a whole, which is more like 3¼ per cent. It has been to Australia’s advantage that we have a high exposure, for an advanced country, to the faster-growing Asian region. As an example, while the euro area is a significant trading partner for Australia, we were probably less affected than many countries in 2012 and 2013 when Europe lapsed back into recession. Two years ago, I noted that the economy of the euro area was still smaller than it was before the financial crisis. Regrettably, that remains true today. Europe is back on a growth path now, but it is still a fairly modest one, and it seems to require extraordinary settings of monetary policy to achieve even that. Growth has recently resumed in Japan after a dip in activity following the enactment of a tax increase last year. Japanese growth rates remain pretty modest, though since Japan has a declining population, they look better on a per capita basis. The full implementation of the so-called “third arrow” of structural reform could be expected, if it occurs, to lift growth per head further over the long run. Growth is proceeding at a reasonable clip in the rest of Asia, though as I noted two years ago, in more than a few countries it has not been possible to restore the pre-crisis growth rates. And the growth that has been achieved has been accompanied in a number of cases                                                 1 With subsequent data revisions the growth rates in mid 2013 look a little lower now. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  by a sizeable increase in debt owed by households, firms or both. How big a vulnerability this will turn out to be under different financial conditions and/or lower growth we cannot yet know. While it has been to our advantage to have a lesser exposure to Europe than many other countries, the flipside is a much greater exposure to China. That means we will be more sensitive to fluctuations in China’s performance than other countries. This is not a new point; I said as much about five years ago.2 But it is perhaps more concrete now, given that China’s growth has slowed appreciably over the past few years. The moderation in 2014 was more or less as China’s policymakers intended. The further moderation seen over the past six months or so may have been a little more than intended. Chinese policy has been responding to that outcome as you would expect: interest rates are declining, and some selected restraints on credit are being eased. Stepping back from the ebb and flow of short-run data, the big point is that China’s policymakers are attempting two major transitions. One is towards more consumption-driven growth, as opposed to investment and export-led growth. This is necessary because a continental-sized economy such as China cannot rely on the rest of the world absorbing rapid growth in its output. The second, related transition is towards a more robust financial structure, which is necessary because the prevailing structure has too many risky aspects. Both these transitions are necessary, but both remain works in progress. How they will play out is unavoidably a source of uncertainty. What does seem fairly clear is that the pace of growth in demand for commodities like iron ore will be lower in future than in the past five years, even as supply continues to increase. Thus far much of the additional supply has been Australian ore, though it is apparent that at least some of the future increase in supply will be from other countries. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that Australian discussion of the Chinese economy has been through the prism of the iron ore price – these days subject to daily monitoring. A few months ago, it almost seemed as though the price of iron ore might, in terms of attention given, eclipse that other price on which Australians focus with a passion, namely the price of a house. But of late house prices seem to have regained their pre-eminent place in our national psyche! Turning away from China, it is quite significant that there is a good deal more optimism now in the United States. The rate of unemployment has fallen considerably and growth in wages has begun to increase. There was a weak March quarter result for growth in output, which most observers attribute to temporary factors, though it remains to be seen just how robust the return to growth has been since. The significance of a healthier US economy is two-fold. One element is that the expectations of many business people around the world, including in Australia, still tend to take a cue from the tone of US business. The second is that, at some point, US monetary policy will begin to adjust to improved conditions. That will be a very gradual process, but at this stage, indications still seem to be that the US Federal Reserve will begin the process some time this year. It is reasonable to hope that this change in course can be accomplished without serious disruption to financial markets, but we cannot be certain of that. Countries receiving cross-border capital flows have generally sought to strengthen their economic and financial fundamentals since the “taper tantrum” of mid 2013. The fact that the Fed has signalled as clearly as possible the way it thinks about these issues should also help reduce instability. On the other hand, “guidance” is no guarantee of smooth sailing. Moreover, we stand today at a highly unusual juncture. We see a combination of remarkably low yields on financial                                                 2 See ‘The Challenge of Prosperity’, Address to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) Annual Dinner, Melbourne, November 2010. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  assets, compressed risk premia and diverging outlooks for monetary policy across the major jurisdictions. It is a complex picture for both market participants and policymakers. Recently, we have seen some large and abrupt movements in currencies, commodity prices and even sovereign bond rates. While to some extent this is a normalisation after a period of unusually subdued volatility, these movements may also be signalling that a degree of underlying fragility has built up over the long period of “search for yield”. Such dynamics bear watching. The Australian economy In Australia, recent growth in the economy has not been as strong as we want. Of course, what we are witnessing is not an economy heading along the course of a normal economic cycle, but a complex and rather lengthy adjustment both to the once-in-a-century cycle in our terms of trade and an earlier increase in household leverage. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, very confident households spent and borrowed more, and saved less, in the process extending their balance sheets. That process started to fade in about 2006 and then finished more abruptly when the financial crisis hit. But by then the run-up in resources prices was imparting a very large stimulus to the economy and allowed for solid growth to continue at a time when most other countries were still feeling the aftermath of the financial crisis. But now most of the capital spending that was needed to lift the output of the mining sector has been completed, at least for the production of iron ore. Some very large LNG projects are still underway, but as those projects and others draw to a close, the decline in mining investment that is already underway will continue (and perhaps accelerate). The latest edition of the Australian National Accounts, released last week, shows the picture. The quarterly growth figure was stronger than what had been embodied in our forecasts in the May Statement on Monetary Policy, though that comes after a weaker-than-expected outcome in the previous quarter. Some of the strength resulted from unusually high export shipments of resources, which were less disrupted by weather conditions in the “cyclone season” than has often been the case in the past. Indications are that this pace of growth wasn’t repeated in the June quarter, when shipments of coal in particular were affected by weather disruptions on the east coast. Taking the results over the past four quarters, growth was “below trend”. Export volume growth contributed strongly, while domestic final demand increased by a bit under 1 per cent, which is quite a weak result. Housing construction rose strongly, and consumer spending over the year rose by more than real household income (that is, the saving rate fell). Both these results owe a good deal to low interest rates and rising asset values. But other components of demand were weak. Business investment fell substantially, with mining investment falling quickly and, as best we can tell, non-mining capital spending also weak. Public final spending didn’t grow at all. Public investment spending fell by 8 per cent over the past year. Overall, these outcomes are weaker than what, two years ago, we expected would be happening by now. Back then, the two-year-ahead forecast was for annual GDP growth to be in a range of 2½ to 4 per cent by mid 2015. The width of that range reflected the normal size of error margins, coupled with the inevitable uncertainty about the timing of when some components of demand outside of mining might strengthen, and the judgement that if accommodative monetary policy really was held in place for several years (which was a key assumption behind those forecasts), activity could at some point start to pick up quite quickly. It will be three months before we get the national accounts data for the June quarter, but at this point, with three of the four quarters available for the year to June 2015, it would appear that the outcome will be either right at the bottom of the range predicted two years ago or, more likely, a bit below it. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Of course, forecasts are hardly more than educated guesswork and two-year-ahead forecasts are even less reliable. That there are inevitably forecast errors is neither surprising nor new, and it is not any more concerning per se now than it always has been. This is far from the biggest forecast error I’ve seen over my three decades in this game. But it is nonetheless useful to see what we can learn from those errors. The following points are prominent: • The terms of trade, which two years ago were assumed to fall, have in fact fallen further – they are about 12 per cent lower than the assumed path. That means national income is lower, which means spending power is lower. • The exchange rate, which at that time was above parity against the US dollar, and was assumed to stay there, is now about 25 per cent lower. It has moved in the same direction as the terms of trade, which is normal. • The lower exchange rate has helped to produce a contribution to growth from “net exports” much greater than earlier forecast, while that from domestic demand has been much weaker. The latter is mainly spread across non-mining business investment and weaker government spending, together with softer consumption on account of lower incomes. One thing which is not very different from the forecast from two years ago is that mining sector capital spending is falling sharply. • Because the net effect of the above factors is that GDP growth has been on the weaker side of expectations, the unemployment rate is about half a percentage point higher than forecast two years ago. Consistent with that, growth in wages is, as you would expect, lower than forecast. • Headline inflation is lower than forecast, largely because of the recent fall in oil prices. Underlying inflation is within the 2–3 per cent range that had been forecast. Again, the depreciation of the exchange rate has been a factor here. • The cash rate is 75 basis points lower than assumed two years ago, as monetary policy has used the room provided by contained inflation to try to do more to help growth. Lending rates have fallen on average by about 100 basis points over that period. This has produced a stronger result for housing construction than forecast and will also have contributed to the rise in dwelling prices. In summary, the economy has in several important respects followed a different track from the one expected a couple of years ago. That is partly because conditions in the world economy were different from what had been expected and partly because several domestic factors were different. Some in-built responses have been in evidence. For example the decline in the exchange rate, even if not by as much as we might have expected, has had the effect of supporting growth and keeping inflation from falling as much as it might have done. And, of course, monetary policy has also responded to the evolving situation, consistent with the Reserve Bank’s mandate. These responses have had the effect of lessening the extent to which growth and inflation have differed from the outcomes expected two years ago, but haven’t managed to eliminate those differences entirely, at least in the case of output growth. The slowing in wage growth in response to soft labour market conditions has also undoubtedly helped to hold employment up. In fact wage growth appears to be somewhat lower than previous relationships between wages and unemployment would suggest. This may be a sign of increased price flexibility in the labour market and could help to explain why employment recently has looked a little higher relative to estimated GDP than might have been expected. These hypotheses can be advanced only tentatively, though, until we have more data. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Looking ahead, the most recent forecasts suggest that growth rates will be similar to those we have observed recently for a while yet. Residential investment will reach new highs over the period ahead. Household consumption is expected to record moderate growth. With national income growth reduced by a falling terms of trade, this requires a modest decline in the saving rate. It doesn’t seem reasonable to expect much more from consumption growth than that. Resources sector investment has a good deal further to fall yet over the next two years. Other areas of investment seem very low and while I would have expected that by now these would have been showing signs of strengthening, the most recent indications are for, if anything, a weakening over the year ahead. Public final spending has not been growing and fiscal consolidation still has some way to run. Under the current macroeconomic conditions, it would seem inappropriate for governments to seek additional restraint here in the near term. Inflation is likely to remain low. Growth in labour costs is very low and some of the forces that were pushing up certain administered prices have started to reverse. So even if the exchange rate were to fall further, which in my view it needs to, we seem unlikely to have a problem with excessive inflation. Putting all that together, as things stand, the economy could do with some more demand growth over the next couple of years. Of course, these are forecasts. They might be wrong. In fact, they will be wrong, in some dimension or other. Our published material goes to some lengths to articulate a range of “risks”. It is easy to think of “downside” ones in the current mood of determined pessimism. But it is not entirely impossible to think of upside ones as well. A further fall in the exchange rate, which is not assumed in the forecasts, would add both to growth and prices. If one thinks that such a decline at some point is likely, that constitutes an “upside” risk. Of course, the list of countries that would prefer a lower exchange rate is a long one and we can’t all have it. That being so, we might give some thought to trying to create some upside risks to the growth outlook through policy initiatives. The Reserve Bank will remain attuned to what it can do, consistent with the various elements of its mandate – including price stability, full employment and financial stability. We remain open to the possibility of further policy easing, if that is, on balance, beneficial for sustainable growth. The temptation, of course, is to presume outcomes can be fine-tuned by policy settings and that we can simply dial up more or less demand in short order to avoid deviations from some ideal path. Reality is inevitably more messy than that and has not always been kind to such fine-tuning notions. As it is, some observers think monetary policy has done too little, while others think it already has done way too much. I think it has been about right for the circumstances. But the bigger point is that monetary policy alone can’t deliver everything we need and expecting too much from it can lead, in time, too much bigger problems. Much of the effect of monetary policy comes through the spending, borrowing and saving decisions of households. There isn’t much cause from research, or from current data, to expect a direct impact on business investment. But of all the three broad sectors – households, government and corporations – it is households that probably have the least scope to expand their balance sheets to drive spending. That’s because they already did that a decade or more ago. Their debt burden, while being well serviced and with low arrears rates, is already high. It is for this reason that I have previously noted some reservations about how much monetary policy can be expected to do to boost growth with lower and lower interest rates. It is not that monetary policy is entirely powerless, but its marginal effect may be smaller, and the associated risks greater, the lower interest rates go from already very low levels. I think everyone can see that. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  If I am correct about this, it really is very important that other policies coalesce around a narrative for growth. In this regard, I think the Government is on the right track in not seeking to compensate for lower revenue growth by cutting spending further in the short run. Of course, some resolution of long-run budget trends is still going to be needed to sustain confidence and that will not be an easy conversation. Meanwhile, as often remarked, infrastructure spending has a role to play in sustaining growth and also in generating confidence. I am doubtful of our capacity to deploy this sort of spending as a short-term countercyclical device. The evidence of history is that it takes too long to start and then too long to stop. But it would be confidence-enhancing if there was an agreed story about a long-term pipeline of infrastructure projects, surrounded by appropriate governance on project selection, risk-sharing between public and private sectors at varying stages of production and ownership, and appropriate pricing for use of the finished product. The suppliers would feel it was worth their while to improve their offering if projects were not just one-offs. The financial sector would be attracted to the opportunities for financing and asset ownership. The real economy would benefit from the steady pipeline of construction work – as opposed to a boom and bust. It would also benefit from confidence about improved efficiency of logistics over time resulting from the better infrastructure. Amenity would be improved for millions of ordinary citizens in their daily lives. We could unleash large potential benefits that at present are not available because of congestion in our transportation networks. The impediments to this outcome are not financial. The funding would be available, with long term interest rates the lowest we have ever seen or are likely to. (And it is perfectly sensible for some public debt to be used to fund infrastructure that will earn a return. That is not the same as borrowing to pay pensions or public servants.) The impediments are in our decision-making processes and, it seems, in our inability to find political agreement on how to proceed. Physical infrastructure is, of course, only part of what we need. The confidence-enhancing narrative needs to extend to skills, education, technology, the ability and freedom to respond to incentives, the ability to adapt and the willingness to take on risk. It is in these areas too, where there are various initiatives in place or planned, but which often do not get enough attention, that we need to create a positive dynamic of confidence, innovation and investment. That is the upside we need to create. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Carolyn Wilkins: Panel remarks for round table discussion at the 21st Conference of Montréal Panel remarks by Ms Carolyn Wilkins, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, for round table discussion at the 21st Conference of Montréal: International Economic Forum of the Americas, Montréal, Quebec, 8 June 2015. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for the invitation to be here today. I’m honoured to be part of this panel. It’s been more than seven years since the global financial crisis began, and we’re still coping with its aftermath. One of the consequences of the crisis has been a disruption of financial globalization. Global capital flows – to give just one measure – have fallen by more than half from their pre-crisis peak of over US$8 trillion.1 I’ll spend a few minutes on why we’re seeing this fragmentation. I’ll then offer my views on what we should do to realize the full benefits of financial globalization and manage the risks associated with it. Causes of fragmentation The retreat from financial globalization that we’ve seen reflects cyclical economic forces, such as the slowdown of global trade and investment. It also reflects structural adjustments, including the deleveraging undertaken by banks to repair their balance sheets and respond to regulatory changes. None of this should come as a surprise, given what we’ve been through. On the cyclical side, the crisis has cost the world economy as much as US$10 trillion in lost output, or almost 15 per cent of production. Global trade slowed, as did the demand for the international financial services that support it. The share of trade in GDP fell after the crisis, reversing some of the 20-percentage-point increase over the two decades that preceded it.2  On the structural side, financial institutions that experienced losses during the crisis had to repair their balance sheets by scaling back their lending – not only at home but especially internationally. Trade, commodities and infrastructure financing were particularly hard hit. Since the crisis, banks have more than doubled the amount of common equity capital they hold. While doing this, banks have tended to focus on their home market and the best ways to allocate capital in the new environment. Rules such as anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing laws may also be altering the terrain. Financial institutions have also had to respond to regulatory changes. For example, derivatives dealers appear to be doing more business with domestic counterparties in part because of more stringent, and sometimes inconsistent, rules.3 While the level of cross-                                                1  The Institute of International Finance, “Financial Globalization: Maximizing Benefits, Containing Risks” December 2014. 2  M.

   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  border activity in this area is still robust, one study finds that regulatory changes can explain roughly half of the drop in cross-border claims since before the crisis.4  To put things in perspective, total foreign banking claims measured as a share of global GDP have fallen by one-third since 2008, to 39 per cent at the end of 2014.5 This fragmentation is of concern to people like me, who believe that open global financial markets are generally a good thing for economies because they facilitate the most efficient allocation of capital and boost growth. At the same time, the crisis taught us that integrated markets also entail risks that need to be properly managed. We know that, unchecked, financial globalization could increase pro-cyclicality and make financial cycles larger.6 In other words, booms and busts could become more frequent and more destabilizing. And it’s possible that international financial flows were inflated by excessive growth in finance relative to global GDP.7 So authorities have to find the right balance between encouraging globalization and guarding against its risks. Getting the right balance Progress is being made globally. We have put in place a framework to better manage the risks that come with financial globalization through reforms agreed to by G-20 leaders. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has established new rules for banks, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions. These are big steps in the right direction. Some of these reforms have been substantially implemented. I’m talking about the Basel III rules, which impose more stringent standards on capital and liquidity and a surcharge for systemically important banks, and the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, which establish higher standards for central counterparties and other systemically important infrastructures. A level playing field on this is supported by peer reviews conducted by the FSB to ensure consistent implementation in different countries. At the national level, recovery and resolution regimes are being introduced to further protect taxpayers and minimize systemic disruption in the event that a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) fails. Canada has made good progress in putting in place the G-20 reforms in the spirit in which they were intended. We’ve implemented Basel III ahead of schedule and started work on recovery and resolution plans for D-SIBs. Some jurisdictions have also made rules that deliberately separate different parts of their financial systems. For example, some have enacted changes to ring-fence retail banking activities within banking groups to limit the funding of investment banking activities with deposits backed by government safety nets – Vickers in the United Kingdom and Volcker in the United States.                                                 4  International Monetary Fund, Navigating Monetary Policy Challenges and Managing Risks, Global Financial Stability Report, April 2015. 5  Based on calculations using data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) (Consolidated Banking Statistics) and the International Monetary Fund (World GDP, from the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database). 6  C. Borio, “The International Monetary and Financial System: Its Achilles Heel and What to Do about It”, BIS Working Paper No. 456, September 2014. 7  In the decade leading up to financial crisis, global banks’ cross-border claims as a share of world GDP increased tenfold, from 6 per cent in 1995 to 60 per cent in 2007. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Every jurisdiction has different requirements, and our view is that we must ensure that jurisdictions don’t go too far down the road toward more domestically oriented financial system reforms. In an interconnected world, the actions of one country affect others. If all jurisdictions act in their own national interest, narrowly defined, everyone could be left worse off. Co-operative outcomes are superior. Mutual recognition This points to the need for coordination among regulators. The G-20 reforms can make the world safer for international capital flows only as long as there is consistent implementation of international standards and mutual recognition among authorities. If we fail to achieve this, we could end up with inconsistent and incomplete regulations that impede desirable flows and create scope for circumvention. Canada has stayed away from imposing structural reforms that would create a separation between commercial and investment banking activities, focusing instead on a principles-based approach. Historically, Canadian banks have benefited from diversification in their business lines, and the consolidated supervision of the banking group by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions has been effective.8  A lot of work remains at the international level. It hasn’t been easy to agree on plans to coordinate cross-border recovery and resolution for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), and not for a lack of effort and goodwill on the part of the home and host authorities. One major step was taken in October, when 18 G-SIBs agreed to a protocol established by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that will give authorities more time to organize an orderly resolution of a troubled bank. The success of this mechanism depends on its broad adoption by market participants, so industry also has a responsibility here. If multilateral agreements prove intractable, bilateral agreements could be another way to reach the same goal, in light of the trend toward regional banking. In time, successful bilateral agreements could even serve as models for more ambitious multilateral agreements. Conclusion Let me wrap up. The global financial system is important to Canada. We’re a small, open economy, highly dependent on global trade. That means we rely on cross-border financial flows to fund exports and investment. And Canadian banks have continued to increase their foreign presence in the post-crisis period. In the past five years, their foreign claims have risen by 70 per cent. This is why Canada is pushing for consistent implementation of global rules. With more homogeneous financial regulation and good co-operation on supervision, we will achieve solid prudential outcomes, build trust and reduce the tension that contributes to ring-fencing and fragmentation. While there are still some challenges at the international level, notably around the resolution of international banks, we continue to make progress. As the reform agenda is implemented, we’ll see an improvement in global financial flows. We probably won’t get back to the pre-crisis pace of globalization. This pace was probably unsustainable anyway. We should nonetheless achieve close to the right balance between sustainable growth and financial stability. I’d like to thank Paul Chilcott and Alexandra Lai for their help in preparing these remarks.                                                 8  M.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Lesetja Kganyago: Africa is rising – seizing the opportunity Address by Mr Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the SWIFT Regional Conference, Cape Town, 5 May 2015. *      *      * Chairperson, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen; It is an honour for me to welcome you all to Cape Town, South Africa on this occasion of the SWIFT Regional Conference. “Africa is rising – Seizing the Opportunity” this is the theme for this year’s conference. I think that you will agree that this theme is appropriate, as Africa is blessed with abundant resources and although we face several challenges, these are far outweighed by the many opportunities that the continent offers. We acknowledge that taking advantage of these opportunities require strong political will and pan-African cooperation, however, the numerous regional integration initiatives taking place all over the continent are testimony that this is indeed possible. This is the 22nd SWIFT African Regional Conference (ARC) and the delegates include policy makers, industry leaders and the broader financial community from across the African continent. The typical African Regional Conference attracts up to 500 delegates from around 40 countries, and is a unique forum for networking, education, discussion, and debate – all within a collaborative environment. I believe that discussions in the next three day will focus, inter alia, on how intra- Africa trade and economic growth can be boosted, a look at how the African securities markets are evolving and the growth plans of African corporates as they expand across the continent. The conference will also focus on leveraging the role of technology innovations in Africa to benefit the financial industry and support sustainable growth objectives of the continent. From the payment system environment, we are aware that intra-Africa payments have in the past mostly been facilitated through correspondent banking arrangements, as has been the standard for cross border payments globally. In practice, intra-Africa payments are effected through correspondent banking relationships with banking partners normally located within the USA or in Europe. Most of these correspondent banking arrangements are still used extensively today, but are proving to be inadequate and inefficient. Across the continent, several regions have launched initiatives to facilitate more efficient transacting mechanisms within their respective regions. The advantage of these initiatives is that transacting parties now have more control over their payments, within the region. Concerns have been raised about the general reduction in correspondent banking relationships, and related financial services globally. The drivers of the reduction in correspondent banking relationships are not clear, but we surmise that regulations relating to AML/CFT and the increase in the number of cross-border money remittance or transfer companies could be contributing factors to this declining trend. In the case of the money remittance companies, it can be argued that global banks may have concerns about the high risks of uncertainty in facilitating transactions with unknown/non-vetted clients, especially those in EMDE’s1, in terms of the AML/CFT2 rules. This raises the potential for fines and reputational risks for these banks and therefore reduces the appetite for exposure to specific jurisdictions by banks participating in this environment. There are                                                 1 Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs). 2 AML – anti money laundering; CFT – counter terrorist financing. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  also potential downsides to decreased cross-border transactions. For example, it is a well-known fact that money remittances attract high costs, and it is therefore likely that small companies would be more affected by the reduction in global correspondent activity. In both instances, it would be the poor and smaller commercial entities that would be most vulnerable if correspondent banking activities are not replaced by more efficient and reliable alternatives. Regional solutions, implemented in the payment system environment, will go a long way to address constraints that may be introduced by the reduction of correspondent banking services, as well as to bring overall efficiencies in the execution of intra-regional cross border payments. I would now like to share with you developments relating to three of these regional initiatives as examples. In 2000, five countries of West Africa (Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone) established the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ). At the same time they also set-up the West African Monetary Institute (WAMI). Liberia joined in 2010. The objective of the countries was to establish the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) as a monetary and customs union with a common currency. Initially they proposed to introduce a Single Currency in 2003, but subsequently agreed to launch the new single currency in 2015. As these countries are represented at this conference, you will benefit from updates on progress made with this initiative. The main objectives of WAMZ were agreed as: • the promotion of trade integration in the region; • trade and financial facilitation; • harmonisation of legislation and statistics; and • payment systems and macroeconomic convergence. The WAMI was established as the main body responsible of the creation of the Common West African Central Bank and the Single Currency of the WAMZ. In east Africa, the East African Community (EAC) has been established as a regional intergovernmental organisation of the Republics of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania, and the Republic of Uganda. The vision of the EAC is to foster a prosperous, competitive, secure, stable and politically united East Africa. Their mission is to widen and deepen economic, political, social and cultural integration in order to improve the quality of life of the people of East Africa through increased competitiveness, value added production, trade and investments. The Treaty for the establishment of the East African Community was signed on 30 November 1999 and come into force on 7 July 2000. The Republic of Rwanda and the Republic of Burundi became full members of the community with effect from 1 July 2007. From a payment system perspective, the region has achieved the goal of implementing an integrated payment infrastructure to facilitate the ease of flow of payments among the participating member counties known as the East Africa Payment System (EAPS). The EAPS is a secure, effective and efficient funds transfer system that enhances efficiency and safety of payments and settlement within the EAC region. The systems operates on a real time gross settlement basis by utilising the linkage between the various partner states’ Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems using SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) messaging network for safe and secure delivery of payment and settlement messages to each other. The EAPS also facilitates cross border transactions that is essential for boosting intra-regional trade among the East African countries. Some of the benefits of EAPS: • real time funds transfers, safe and efficient transfer of large value payments 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  • finality and irrevocability of payments • increased accessibility as EAPS is available in all the commercial banks’ branch networks, and • same-day settlement. This initiative is indeed a success that is worth celebrating. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) was established as a development coordinating conference (SADCC) in 1980 and transformed into a development community in 1992. It is an inter-governmental organisation whose goal is to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth and socio-economic development through efficient productive systems, deeper co-operation and integration, good governance and durable peace and security among fifteen Southern African member-states. In the process of driving its development objectives, the region adopted a Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan. In support of this plan, central banks within the region working in collaboration with the banking community launched a payment system integration project that culminated in the implementation of the SADC Integrated Regional Electronic Settlement System (SIRESS). According to the latest data, the implementation of the SIRESS system has resulted in 43 per cent of eligible intra-SADC cross-border South African Rand payments for the participating nine countries being settled through accounts that regional banks hold on the SIRESS system, instead of via the normal cross-border correspondent banking system. At this relatively ‘early’ stage of SIRESS (implemented July 2013), the high percentage of cross-border transactions being settled via the SIRESS system in real time is significant, and it could in future have an even more significant impact on correspondent banking activity within the SADC region. I take great pride in being able to share with you that SIRESS has reached the ZAR 1 trillion settlement mark in the last week of April 2015. We also recognise that the emergence of regional solutions such as SIRESS, requires regional authorities to resolve possible concerns that may arise from regulatory requirements within their business process flows to ensure that matters such as AML/CFT and exchange controls, where they exist, are taken care of. It is my hope that the development of these initiatives will lay a solid foundation for facilitating trade and investment in Africa. Leveraging of current infrastructure, efficient securities market solutions and future infrastructure solutions may contribute to facilitating the ease of investment in the continent. The regional initiatives are also paving the way for the achievement of the integration agenda of the whole continent and I hope that in undertaking the separate regional initiatives, open standards are adopted to facilitate the ultimate integration of these regional infrastructures. What Africa needs is to get the various regional systems to interact with each other so that settlement can take place seamlessly across the region. I also note that with the aim of leveraging the hands-on experience with projects in Africa, one session in this conference will look at the rapid growth of the regional payment systems and how lessons learnt from these projects could be replicated in other regions. The regulatory session should explore how, taking a proactive stance in coping with new financial regulations, moving quickly to adopt global best practice in the various fields of compliance and addressing of issues relating to regulatory capital requirements can lead to competitive advantages. It is also with interest that I gather that for the first time, the 2015 ARC will host an African round of the SWIFT Innotribe start-up challenge. Innotribe is a laudable initiative that offers an opportunity for bringing innovative ideas to the fore and fostering discussions that would enable practical solutions to emerge out of those ideas. The start-up challenge will bring together young African financial technology companies from across the continent, introducing them to venture capitalists and investors. The winners will proceed and compete in the grand 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  finale at the Sibos 2015 conference scheduled later this year in Singapore. Our continent will surely reap benefits from these initiatives and I encourage you to ensure that you are part of the growing ARC community in 2015, and that your industry discussion will be fruitful. It is clear from the programme that the organisers have put together a full and well thought out programme. I hope you will benefit from this 22nd ARC and in this spirit I wish you well as you share experiences and meet new colleagues. Thank you 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ashraf Mahmood Wathra: Financing agriculture in Pakistan Keynote address by Mr Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the International Conference on Innovative Agriculture Financing, Islamabad, 28 April 2015. *      *      * Hon’ble Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Federal Finance Minister  Hon’ble Mr. Sikandar Malik Bosan, Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research  Mr. Patrick T. Evans, Country Representative, FAO of United Nations  Mr. Chamnong Siriwongyotha, General-Secretary, Asia-Pacific Rural & Agriculture Credit Association (APRACA)  Mr. Saeed Ahmad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)  Our esteemed experts/guests from overseas  Distinguished CEOs/Presidents/Executives of banks, MFBs, Representatives of Farmers & Business Associations, and Academia.  Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.  Assalam-o-Alaikum and Good Morning!  1. I extend a very warm welcome to all the participants in today’s International Conference on Innovative Agriculture Financing and to Islmabad. I am particularly grateful to our international speakers who have taken out time to travel long distances to attend this conference; and share their knowledge and insights with us on a topic which is crucial to our national food security, growth and well-being. I would like to express my special gratitude to our Chief Guest Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Guest of Honor Mr. Sikandar Malik Bosan whose presence here today is a reflection of the focus and importance that the country’s leadership places on the development of Agriculture sector.  2. Honorable Finance Minister: we are grateful for all the support that you have provided to the promotion of inclusive finance in the country. We all know that you have great passion and high commitment for expanding the contribution of agriculture in the economy. In line with your vision of a progressive and equitable economy, the Government has initiated unprecedented programs and schemes for the promotion of financing to agriculture, especially to small farmers. SBP and banks are striving to optimally leverage these initiatives to make far-reaching impact on financial inclusion and economic development.  3. Honorable Minister for Food Security, Mr. Sikandar Malik Bosan: The importance of your office and its contributions to the development of agriculture sector are widely acknowledged. The crucial role that your Ministry is playing for the growth and development of Agriculture with special focus on providing relief to small farmers by linking them to the market; introducing cutting edge farm technology and state of the art high yield seed varieties and numerous other innovations for the promotion of agri-based exports for the uplift of agriculture in the country.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  4. Majority of the world’s poor, an astounding number of over two billion people share one common profession: farming. But where agriculture harbors so many of the world’s poor; it also offers the key to graduate economies out of the vicious cycle of poverty and food insecurity. Beyond direct links to rural livelihood, agricultural sector has strong links to rest of the economy, and this is one of the most powerful ways in which it generates overall growth and reduces poverty. Empirical evidence suggests that investment in agriculture is 2.5 to 3.0 times more effective in increasing the income of the poor than is non-agricultural 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  investment. Based on this premise, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is making relentless efforts to promote agriculture finance.  My dear fellows and colleagues,  5. In our efforts to promote financial services to the agriculture-based community, we are faced with the challenge of removing numerous stumbling blocks to meet the financial needs of the agri-sector.  6. However, with the Grace of Allah Almighty, the financial sector has not only stood strong against these challenges but has also registered remarkable growth. Over the years, we have moved away from the ‘mandatory-credit regime’ where force-feeding of targets to highly regulated commercial banks was the norm; towards a more open and ‘market led’ model where State bank has adapted itself into the role of a facilitator and developmental partner of financial institutions to accelerate the growth of agriculture finance in its natural eco-system.  7. Today, more than ever before, banks are successfully exploiting business opportunities in agriculture financing. We started off with a hand-full of banks as reluctant financiers of agri-sector but now we have 33 institutions, including Islamic and Microfinance banks that are providing financing efficiently to their agri-clientle.  8. Agri credit has demonstrated a consistent rise with annualized average growth rate of 16.2 percent for last three years. As a result agri credit increased to Rs 391 Billion in 2013-14 with Agriculture Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) pushing the limits to even more aggressive credit disbursement target of Rs 500 Billion to be achieved during FY 2014-15. It is encouraging to note that banks have already disbursed Rs 326 Billion during the first 9 months, which is 65% of the target of FY 14-15, and is 28 % higher than the same period last year.  It is also heartening that the portfolio quality of banks agri portfolio has also improved over the recent period. I believe that the banks would be able to further improve the portfolio quality of agri-lending by using innovative lending models supported with their experience curve.  9. It has been through the collaborative efforts of all stakeholders that the banks have improved their actual agri disbursement to financing requirements ratio from 37% to 53% over the last 5 years and we are working to improve it even further so that more and more farmers can free themselves from the shackles of exploitative informal credit.  In order to make it happen, SBP has taken initiatives to promote agri-financing to bring depth, inclusion, efficiency and stability into the system:  • Innovations in agri-financing are being promoted by adoption of value chain and warehouse receipt financing through constant guidance and pilot projects.  • Enhanced risk management through crop and livestock loan insurance schemes and credit guarantee schemes, to help banks venture into providing financing to farmers, particularly the smaller ones.  • SBP has been extensively involved in capacity building of farmers through offering financial literacy programs and financial service providers, through engagement of local and international experts who are helping the financial service providers to tailor their approach for improved service delivery and increased profits.  Distinguished guests!  10. Yes State Bank views positively at the recent increasing momentum, but we should not lose sight of the fact that our long journey in agri-credit market has just started. In this context, I feel we will be wrong if we say that Rs. 500 billion is a big target. Let us not forget that this is only 53% of our credit demand.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  11. Going forward, the most critical challenges are inclusion of majority small and marginalized farmers, addressing geographical imbalances and financing to non-crop activities, which will lead to enhancing the share of agri credit in banks’ advances. SBP is committed to continue its efforts to deliver real benefits to the farming community and it is hoped that with the joint efforts of policy makers and the industry, agri-financing would soon emerge as a sound, scalable and sustainable business segment for banks in Pakistan.  12. In the end I would like to sincerely thank FAO for their remarkable support in collaborating with SBP for organizing this event. FAO has long played a strong role for the development of agriculture sector in Pakistan through introduction of innovation and technical assistance and this event is a mark of their continued commitment to the cause of developing an exceedingly vibrant agriculture sector in Pakistan. I am also grateful to UKAID for their continued and long-term support to advance financial inclusion in Pakistan. Let me also express our gratitude to Asia-Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA) for the importance and attention that you always give to Pakistan and SBP in the regional initiatives.  Ladies & Gentlemen,  13. I wish you all a pleasant participation in the conference and hope that this experience will invigorate the spirit of transformation that challenges the conventional beliefs and fosters innovative thinking to find lasting solutions to the problems of agriculture-financing.  Thank you our Chief Guest Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister, and the Guest of Honour Federal Minister Mr. Sikandar Malik Bosan, and all the participants and speakers! 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ravi Menon: Smart regulation and sustainable insurance growth Speech by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the Insurance Institute of London, London, 12 May 2015. *      *      * Mr Stephen Riley, President of the Insurance Institute of London Mr John Nelson, Chairman, Lloyd’s of London Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. I wish to thank John for inviting me to speak to you today. It is a privilege to address members of this esteemed Institute, and a pleasure to do so in a heritage building of such architectural and historic interest. I have been to this building before. And my first thought as Lloyd’s Building came into view, along with its plumbing, stairways and lift shafts, was transparency. So it is apt that in the same spirit of transparency, I should make a couple of disclosures: • one, I am not an actuary or an accountant, and • two, I am not responsible for Solvency II. But John has kindly assured me that the musings of a central banker and regulator from the Far East counts towards fulfilling your continuing professional development requirements. So for my speech today, I will offer an overview of MAS’ roles as central bank and integrated supervisor, our approach to regulating and developing the financial sector, and prospects for the insurance industry in Asia. MAS as central bank, integrated supervisor, and financial sector promoter Those of you who have visited Singapore might have come across one of the highlights of our architectural heritage – the black and white colonial bungalows. Combining British aesthetic sensibilities with local adaptations to a tropical climate, these former colonial residences exude stately elegance while offering cool, airy comfort come monsoon rain or equatorial shine. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) itself operates out of a decidedly functional office block. Thankfully, the work that the MAS does is rather more interesting. • MAS houses under one roof central banking, financial surveillance, and integrated supervision. • MAS is also responsible for developing a sound and progressive financial centre. MAS’ single agency model sets us apart from other financial regulators. Many jurisdictions operate on what is commonly known as the twin peaks model of regulation. Under this model, separate agencies have responsibilities for prudential oversight and market conduct respectively. Prudential oversight is concerned principally with the safety and soundness of institutions while market conduct is focused on effective functioning of markets and consumer protection. Australia, Canada, and the UK are among the leading jurisdictions with twin peaks regulators. Like the black and white bungalows, MAS’ unique mandate of central bank, integrated supervisor, and promoter of financial sector development, was born partly out of circumstance. For a small country like Singapore with limited human capital, the single agency model allows MAS to more effectively utilise available expertise and exploit synergies to achieve our objectives for the financial sector and wider economy. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  And like the blending of British and tropical themes in the bungalows, bringing together central banking, integrated supervision, and developmental functions serves important practical purposes. First, being an integrated supervisor gives us better insights into the full range of activities that a financial institution engages in and hence facilitates more holistic financial supervision. Integrated supervision is consistent with the broad range of services that financial institutions provide as well as the blurring of distinctions across financial products that we see today. • Banks offer their clients a suite of financial services, including investment and insurance products. • Insurance companies offer financial planning solutions that incorporate elements of savings deposits and investments, in addition to protection. There are synergies across prudential regulation and market conduct regulation. Market conduct issues provide useful perspectives on the prudential safety and soundness of individual firms. How financial institutions treat their customers speaks a great deal about their corporate values, ethical standards, and quality of risk management and internal controls. Second, being a central bank and a financial regulator allows us to harness synergies between macroeconomic analysis and financial stability oversight. During the Global Financial Crisis and subsequent Eurozone crisis, macroeconomic shocks, financial market stresses, and institution-specific vulnerabilities interacted in complex ways with consequences for both systemic stability and the safety of individual institutions. The two-way flow of information and sharing of perspectives between the central banking and supervisory arms of MAS proved invaluable in helping us assess a rapidly evolving situation and co-ordinate appropriate policy responses in a timely manner. Having central banking and financial supervision within one organisation is not the only way to achieve better financial stability outcomes. It makes sense in a small country like Singapore. Larger jurisdictions have sought the same outcomes through strengthened co-ordination mechanisms among the various agencies whose work contributes to financial stability. The Financial Stability Oversight Council in the US and the Financial Policy Committee in the UK are two good examples. Third, being a financial regulator as well as promoter of financial sector development helps ensure that regulation is not only robust but sensitive to the broader needs of the economy. Lest there be any doubt, financial stability is our overriding objective. But a safe financial sector that does not help to meet the needs of businesses and individuals or support economic growth and development misses its purpose. Sound regulation is about promoting a robust yet vibrant financial sector that supports the wider needs of the economy. Our experience has been we can achieve better stability and development outcomes within one organisation with a shared purpose rather than separate agencies with possibly conflicting goals. Smart regulation – sound but purposeful I would describe our approach – or at least our goal – as smart regulation: regulation that is sound yet purposeful. MAS seeks to do this in three ways. • First, regulation is aligned with the best international standards but is also appropriate to the risks in domestic markets. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  • Second, regulation is complemented with intensive supervision that calibrates responses according to the risk profile and impact of individual institutions. • Third, regulation is focused on outcomes rather than prescribed checklists and is implemented in a way that seeks to minimise compliance burden. Aligned with international standards and appropriate to domestic risks MAS’ regulatory framework is aligned with global standards and principles. Indeed, we play an active role in developing many of these standards through active participation in various international standard setting bodies, including the IAIS. Global standards promote financial stability by providing a more level playing field for financial institutions and minimising regulatory arbitrage. But financial markets are not homogeneous in their risk profiles. It is necessary to apply regulatory standards in a manner that is sensitive and appropriate to the risks associated with particular markets and activities. Take for example our risk-based capital (RBC) framework for insurance. Insurance companies in Singapore have been subject to RBC requirements since 2005, predating Solvency II. At that time, there was no international capital standard for insurers, let alone one that is risk-based. But we assessed that maintaining capital buffers to cushion against potential losses was relevant to insurance companies as it was to banks. So, we proceeded to put in place capital requirements for insurers operating in Singapore, even when most other jurisdictions did not. At the same time, we were conscious of the need to apply the capital framework in a manner commensurate with the risks posed by different types of insurance activities. • For example, Lloyd’s Asia syndicates are not subject to the RBC framework. This is because the Lloyd’s market is approved and regulated by the UK regulator, and premiums are booked in the UK and protected by Lloyd’s central fund. • Likewise, captives and marine mutuals are not subject to RBC. They are restricted to writing business principally for their parent and related corporations, and of their own members respectively. The risk they pose to the broader financial system is low. Complementing regulation with supervision Close, and if necessary intrusive, supervision of financial institutions is an important complement to industry-wide regulation. Frequent and in-depth monitoring of the institutions we supervise helps us calibrate our supervisory approach to the particular circumstances of each institution. An important aspect of supervision is surveillance, which seeks to identify and assess risks and vulnerabilities that may affect the financial system, including insurance companies. A critical component of surveillance is stress testing. • Since 2005, MAS has been conducting annual stress tests to assess the insurance industry’s preparedness against both macroeconomic stress scenarios and more insurance-specific scenarios. The more we can rely on risk-focused supervision and ongoing surveillance informed by periodic stress tests, the less we need to design one-size-fits-all rules and regulations that seek to cover all risks. Outcome-focused regulation and minimising compliance burden The third aspect of smart regulation is to focus on desired outcomes. This means articulating and communicating clearly the desired outcomes of regulation and allowing financial 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  institutions the latitude to achieve these outcomes in ways that make business sense and minimise compliance burden. Consultation on proposed rules and even co-creation of new rules together with industry is therefore an important aspect of MAS’ regulatory approach. • Consultation helps MAS better understand the likely impact of new regulation and how it might best be implemented. • By involving industry and stakeholders in co-creating regulatory requirements, we are able to minimise unintended consequences and foster better industry understanding and support. Singapore as an Asian insurance hub Even as we strengthen and update our regulation and supervision of the insurance industry, MAS has been promoting Singapore’s development as an Asian insurance hub. Emerging Asia as an insurance growth market The demand for insurance services is growing rapidly in Emerging Asia. For a long time, insurance growth lagged economic growth in Emerging Asia. But this is changing, and changing fast. • Munich Re projects that Asia will account for 40% of the global insurance market by 2020. • Five of the top 10 primary growth markets will be in the Asia-Pacific; this includes China, India, and Indonesia. There are three structural factors driving demand for insurance in Emerging Asia. First, Asia is getting richer. Projections by the IMF show that Emerging Asia will remain the fastest growing region in the world over the next decade. As incomes rise in Asia, governments, corporates, and individuals will increasingly seek insurance to protect their growing economic assets. • Burgeoning urbanisation, infrastructure development, and cross-border trade will drive demand for commercial and specialty insurance. • A growing middle class and rising affluence will underpin a steady increase in life and health insurance penetration rates. Second, Asia is getting older. Asia is facing declining fertility rates, increasing life expectancy, and a rapidly ageing population. • The United Nations projects that, by 2030, Asia’s old age dependency ratio will be 16%, up from today’s 11%. • Against this demographic backdrop, public retirement and pension systems in Asia remain inadequate. The retirement gap between savings and retirement needs can be as high as 13 years. • This will spur greater demand for private health insurance, annuity and other retirement security products. Third, Asia is becoming more aware of catastrophic risk. • Over the last 30 years, Asia has borne the brunt of natural catastrophe losses, accounting for almost half of the world’s estimated economic losses from natural disasters. Yet less than 5% of the losses were insured, compared to 40% in advanced economies. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  • At the same time, rapid urbanisation is concentrating ever higher economic wealth in exposed areas. Eight out of the ten global mega-cities most at risk from natural perils are located in Asia. They include Jakarta, Kolkata, Manila, and Shanghai. This large protection gap in Emerging Asia presents the global insurance industry, confronting mature markets and excess capacity, with a significant opportunity to deploy capital for better returns. London and Singapore as complementary insurance centres International financial centres in Asia, like Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as domestic financial centres in China and Korea are well-placed to meet this growing demand for insurance in Asia. But international financial centres outside Asia – such as London – with the enormous breadth of their markets, depth of financial expertise, and connectivity with other financial centres – also stand to gain from Asia’s rise. On occasion one hears stories of London losing ground as an international insurance centre due to tightening regulatory standards and a shift in the global economic centre of gravity to emerging markets. But polls and expert opinion also predicted the recent UK election race would be neck and neck. On both counts, the numbers prove otherwise. • London is the undisputed global insurance market for specialty commercial risks – insuring highly exotic and bespoke risks from Formula 1 drivers to Cristiano Ronaldo’s legs. • London controls more than 60 billion pounds in premiums, which makes the London market twice the size of Bermuda, three times that of Switzerland, and more than 10 times bigger than Singapore. With its wealth of insurance and specialist risk capacity, London insurance is well positioned to ride the growth in Asian demand. But insurers will benefit from closer proximity to markets, information, and talents. Global insurers and brokers are responding to a growing preference for local placements by setting up local offices in high growth markets to understand their clients better and to be more responsive to their needs. This is where Singapore and London can play complementary roles. London with its unparalleled insurance expertise and experience, and Singapore, with its market proximity and client knowledge can collaborate on providing insurance and risk management solutions that are, relevant, appropriate and responsive to Asian needs. Conclusion The fascinating origins of Lloyds, over 300 years ago – in a coffee house where seafarers gathered to swap intelligence on their trade – illustrates the enduring power of information, networking and the centrality of markets. As with Lloyd’s coffee house, the essence of financial centres lies in connecting markets and people to provide innovative solutions to further economic prosperity. The rising demand for financial services in Asia offers tremendous opportunities for London and Singapore to strengthen our connections for sustainable insurance growth. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Anita Angelovska-Bezoska: Macedonia’s current macroeconomic landscape and main challenges ahead Speech by Ms Anita Angelovska-Bezoska, Vice-Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, at the economic and financial dialogue on the Economic Reforms Programs on Western Balkan and Turkey, Brussels, 12 May 2015. *      *      * Dear Ministers, Dear representatives of the European Commission, European Central Bank and Eurostat, At the beginning, let me express our gratitude to the European Central Bank, European Commission and Eurostat for their assessment of our Economic Reforms Program for the period 2015–2017. Let me mention that we appreciate very much this dialogue with the EU institutions and the overall feedback on our policies that we have received during the process and we believe that it is highly beneficial regarding our preparedness for joining the EU. At this point, I would like to address several important issues related to the current macroeconomic landscape of the Macedonian economy, as well as the main challenges ahead. The growth momentum was kept in 2014, with the real GDP growth accelerating to 3.8% p.a. As the external environment is not sufficiently “growth-conducive”, the strong performance of the domestic economy is explained by country-specific factors. Firstly, it is a reflection of the positive fundamental shifts, with growing foreign investments, mainly in the tradable sector. They are helping the economy to gradually increase its resilience, by significantly increasing the diversification of the production and the export structure of the economy, but also by yielding positive second-round effects, improving the labor market conditions, increasing the know-how, integrating domestic suppliers in the production process. Secondly, the economy has been impacted favorably by the fiscal stimulus in the infrastructure, an area continuously being pinpointed as a weak spot, when it comes to the structural competitiveness. Hence, albeit the fiscal impulse does have positive short run effects on growth – bridging over the current “anemic external environment”, it also affects the long-term potential of the economy. The solid economic recovery is significantly improving the labor market conditions, increasing the labor demand, reducing the unemployment, positively impacting the participation rate, but also boosting the productivity growth of the economy. As being largely export and investment-led, the solid growth does not create pressures on the external position of the economy, nor on the inflation. On the contrary, the external sector is in a relatively good shape, with the current account deficit being brought down to 1.3% of GDP, hitting the low end of the average of around 2% in the last five years. The incessant improvement in the current account, to a large extent reflects the rising net-impact on trade of the new foreign production facilities, this particularly being the case in 2014. Yet, as the foreign demand has started to recover, some positive shifts in the more traditional export segments are also visible. Of course, last year the fall in the oil prices was also beneficial for the trade balance. On the financing side, the financial flows were large enough to cover the current account deficit and to provide additional reserve accumulation. It is important to note that FDI inflows continued to flow in the economy, with their ratio to GDP being kept stable at 3.3% of GDP. Yet, the largest part of the financing flows came through the government borrowing at the international market, at rather favorable terms, pinpointing the perception of the investors for sound fundamentals and rather prudent policies in the Macedonian economy. Observing the inflation path, it more or less resembled the inflation pattern elsewhere, with the falling food and energy prices pushing prices down. The average headline rate for 2014 was mildly negative (–0.3%), while the core inflation albeit slowing down, on average remained positive. The inflation adjustment is perceived as temporary, driven by supply-side factors, and without any risks to become entrenched in the inflation expectations and to jeopardize the 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  economic recovery. The fact that the negative output gap has been narrowing and the fall of the prices has been significantly slowing down in the first months of this year, just support the former notion. Domestic financing through the banking sector significantly increased in 2014, with credit market recovering much faster compared to the previous years. Given that the banking system entered the crisis with sufficient capital and liquidity buffers, the credit flows to the economy in fact never seized. Yet, during the last year, on the backdrop of the economic recovery and the improvement in the overall risks perceptions, the credit accelerated to 10% on an annual basis, reflecting both the supply and demand for credits. A notable rise of the allocation of credits to corporate sector compared to the previous years was observed. Hence, both the size and the structure of credits were growth supportive. The financing of the credit growth was underpinned by solid rise in deposits (10.4% p.a.), confirming yet again the reliance of the banks on domestic sources of financing, rather than on cross-border flows, which might be quite volatile at the current juncture. An important point here is the trend of rising preferences to save in domestic currency, which continued in 2014, reflecting stable expectations and reducing the monetary policy burden. The banking sector remained stable and sound, with solid liquidity and capital adequacy ratio of 15.7% at the end of 2014. Non-performing loans of the banks remained at a moderate level during the crisis period, compared with the region. In 2014, they were relatively stable, slightly decreasing to 11.3% at the end of the year and remained highly provisioned. The actual and the envisaged economic recovery is expected to further improve the quality and the financial soundness of the borrowers, and to further support the downward path of the NPLs. Yet, vigilance in this area is important to prevent buildup and materialization of systemic risk. Last year was no exception in terms of close monitoring of the soundness of the banking system, and changes in the prudential regulation, which were an appropriate balance between the need to support private sector financing, while maintaining the health of the banking system at the same time. What was the monetary policy stance like in 2014 given the already elaborated economic and financial conditions? In general, the accommodative stance was maintained. The main interest rate was maintained at the historically lowest level, the targeted measures to support net-exporting and electricity producing companies were extended until the end of 2015, and certain credit-supportive macro-prudential measures were undertaken. This relatively loose stance was maintained as a consequence of the “benign” external position, which did not jeopardize the foreign reserves, and enabled a rather balanced foreign exchange market during the year. Low inflation was also in favor of maintaining the accommodative stance. Yet, the room for monetary policy accommodation appears to be largely exhausted. The outlook for the 2015–2016, is more or less expected to resemble the state of the economy in the previous year. Growth of the economy is expected to accelerate to 4.1% and 4.5% in 2015 and 2016. The fundamental factors to underpin the growth dynamics remain the same. The boost to the export and investment is expected by the new and the existing foreign companies, as well as those envisaged to enter the market. Investment cycle is expected to be further strengthened by the continuation of the productive fiscal investments. As the external demand is envisaged to recover further, additional stimuli is expected through this channel. The above mentioned growth factors are expected to strengthen further the labor market and the disposable income of the households, hence boosting the private consumption as well. The growth expectations provide room for additional rise of the deposit potential in the banking system, which accompanied with the rise in the credit demand and the willingness of the banks to lend, should enable credit growth at a rate of 9–10% in the period to come. The inflation is expected to be influenced mainly by the global prices of primary commodities and the consumers prices of our main trading partners. An average inflation of 0.5% is expected for 2015, with the current forecast indicating its reversal to 2% in 2016, reflecting the rise in the demand and in the import prices. The structural improvements in the export sector are expected to continue in 2015, which along with the overall external recovery and the much lower oil prices, are envisaged to bring about a moderate current 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  account deficit of bellow 1.6% of GDP. In the following year, widening to 3% is expected, reflecting the fall in private transfers and import pressures from the new investment. The external financing needs, within the current scenario, are expected to be covered by further inflows of foreign direct investments and by the public borrowing for infrastructure purposes. The current forecast points to a rather stable external debt to GDP ratio. No major pressures are foreseen in the following two years on foreign reserves, and they are to be maintained at the adequate level. Risks surrounding this baseline macroeconomic scenario should not be neglected. For us, as a small an open economy, they mostly come from the external environment and our main trading and financial partners. Although with the latest monetary easing of the ECB the downside risks to the euro zone growth are less pronounced, and in general the global growth risks are more balanced, they are still present and if being materialized, could impact the economy. Additional source of risks are the sharp and sudden swings in the primary commodities prices, which for country like ours, can change the envisaged economic profile to a large extent. A new, additional source of risks is the current domestic political context, which can harm the economy, if not being tackled swiftly. Of course, the risks are challenging and are to be closely monitored. This is even more pronounced, given that the policies’ space at the current juncture is to a great extent exhausted. Hence, the continuation of the structural reforms remains paramount and a challenge, as it can further increase the resilience of the economy, mitigate the risks and reduce the policy burden. For us as emerging country, with foreign bank presence, the global financial regulatory reforms also pose challenges, as they can possibly stimulate deleveraging, reduce access to financing and financing flows to the private sector. At the end, let me also avail myself of this opportunity to emphasize yet again our continuous efforts to align with the EU requirements in all areas of operation, especially the banking regulation and statistics, notwithstanding the efforts and the progress done in all other fields. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Interview in der Standard Interview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in der Standard, conducted by Mr Andras Szigètvari on 10 June 2015 and published on 13 June 2015. *      *      * Standard: Mr Praet, the role of the ECB has changed since the outbreak of the crisis. You are now engaging in political debate, telling countries what reforms to implement. Hasn’t the ECB stretched its mandate in order to maintain price stability? Praet: As you know, the ECB takes monetary policy decisions to achieve its objective of maintaining price stability. We make our voice heard on structural reforms when it is considered necessary in the context of our mandate under the Treaty. And, as Mario Draghi indicated in Sintra, for members of a monetary union, resilience is crucial to avoid that shocks lead to permanent economic divergence over time ‒ it therefore has direct implications for price stability. In this sense, we are different from, for example, the Federal Reserve in the United States, which would never engage in such a debate. We frequently get the advice that we should just concentrate on our core business ‒ monetary policy. But, in a currency union like the euro area, individual countries have lost the flexibility provided by an exchange rate of their own. They must thus become more resilient to crises and external shocks. Sound governance and effective institutions are of key importance. That applies, among other things, to labour and product markets, or courts and administration. They are needed for a more efficient monetary policy in a currency union and therefore we tell governments that structural reforms are important. Here, our interest is not in how countries implement these reforms, that is up to them. What interests us is if they are successful, as this impacts the monetary union as a whole. However, I would also like to make the self-critical comment that, in the past, our messages have sounded too much like a mantra. Standard: What do you mean? Praet: In several respects, countries are similar as they are part of a monetary union, but in many respects they differ as a result of their national conditions. So there are various combinations of structural reforms that work – there is no “one-size-fits-all” model. We must make this clear, otherwise there may be the impression that our citizens don’t have much of a choice. We must convey to them the fact that reforms also allow for diversity. For example, it is not enough to merely say publicly that a country’s labour market must become more flexible. Otherwise, people take this as meaning that it should become easier to fire people. That is wrong. In Germany, for example, after the dramatic contraction in demand as a result of the 2008 crisis, firms did not get rid of workers. Unions accepted wage reductions or shorter working hours and that prevented a worse decline. Thus, despite apparent rigidities, the labour market responded in a very flexible way. Also, countries can be wealthy and stable without all having to implement the same policies. The United States and Sweden are two good examples: labour markets are very different there, but people in these countries still have a good standard of living. Standard: What you’re saying sounds good in theory. But within the Troika, the ECB has always demanded of Portugal and Greece that they weaken protection against layoffs and soften collective wage agreements. There hasn’t really been that much room for manoeuvre. Praet: Our job in the Troika is to support the EU Commission in its work. That is technical work and, at the end of the day, it’s the Eurogroup that makes the political decision as to which direction should be followed, since it represents the elected governments and therefore European taxpayers. It must also be clear that not every political solution is 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  feasible, as social systems must remain fundable. Still, I hope that, in the future, there will be a greater focus on giving countries more ownership of their reform programmes; they should act on their own initiative and take responsibility. Standard: But is it possible to really change a country, when it’s trying to make savings? Praet: As the crisis took effect, investors’ trust in the sustainability of several countries’ debt was eroded. The ensuing adjustment of public finances was therefore implemented looking mainly at the short-term effects. Frequently, public investments were cut and value-added taxes were raised in order to obtain quick debt reduction, even if this weighed on growth prospects. At the same time, however, certain countries have reformed successfully ‒ their labour markets have become more flexible and banks have been restructured. That wasn’t easy and it was also painful, but they are growing again. Standard: But even your colleagues are saying that a radical course of austerity isn’t the right medicine, for example, in the case of Greece. Praet: Allow me to make a general point: institutional standards in many countries that faced challenges were particularly low. The World Bank, and also the IMF, issue some well-known rankings on good governance and solid institutions. These show that there is a clear correlation between the per capita GDP of a country and its position in such rankings. Some countries rank very low in terms of all criteria related to good governance. Competitiveness can be regained by making it cheaper to produce goods. However, so long as the business environment remains unchanged, the results will not be satisfactory. This problem was already touched upon in the first reform programmes. But too little importance was attached to the problem of governance standards. Standard: Earlier on, you talked about “ownership”. But this implies that a government which does not believe in reform measures shouldn’t implement them. Praet: At the end of the 1970s, I worked as an economist for the IMF. At that time, requests for aid from states, the so-called “letter of intent”, were pre-written by IMF staff, but then sent by these countries to the IMF as their own letters. Even though the content was the outcome of discussions, that was, of course, somewhat strange. But the IMF gave that money and imposed the conditions, so that was the understanding of “ownership” then. I believe that we have learnt from this. Standard: But in the case of Greece, this means that, no matter what the left-wing Syriza government signs, it can’t work as long as they don’t believe in it themselves. Praet: Because of the ongoing negotiations, I won’t comment on Greece. Fundamentally, mutual trust and credibility are of critical importance in such situations. This means that when a country agrees to do something, it has to implement the agreement. The more credible a country is, the more patient creditors can be and the more trust they can show. That goes for all countries: if a government is trusted, it doesn’t mean so much if an agreed figure is not reached exactly in a year. The problem is that if you lose this confidence, the situation becomes messy and creditors then immediately press for results. Standard: Jean-Claude Trichet, the former President of the ECB, was an active letter-writer: he wrote a letter to Ireland, threatening to cut aid to the country if it didn’t accept an aid programme and agree to reforms. He later exerted pressure on the Berlusconi government in Rome and the Socialists in Spain. Did that not go beyond the ECB’s mandate? Praet: I won’t comment on those letters. However, I would say that, before the outbreak of the financial crisis, we in the euro area invested too little in institutions that would’ve been available for emergencies. Consequently, institutions dealing with banking crises were too weak. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Standard: Independence is very important for central banks. Does the question also have to be put differently in public now: to what extent is a central bank allowed to get involved in politics? Praet: I would put it this way: because there were no sufficiently effective crisis management institutions when the crisis erupted, the ECB could not have simply ignored the potential consequences of the banking crisis for price stability. In the light of its mandate, the ECB couldn’t accept that. Standard: The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, said this week that it would be a disaster if his country left the euro because the whole world would see that the euro is reversible. How do you see it? Praet: Let me reiterate what Mario Draghi said in the ECB press conference a week ago: the Governing Council of the ECB wants Greece to remain a member of the euro. Standard: Mr Praet, what does it feel like to be a thief? Praet: A thief? Standard: Yes. That’s how many people in Austria would describe you. After all, you and your colleagues at the ECB have, de facto, abolished interest rates. Anybody who puts their money in a savings account hardly receives anything now. Praet: I’m sure that most Austrians feel confident that our monetary policy is the appropriate and necessary reaction to the weak economic conditions and the extraordinarily low inflation rates, which are far below our monetary policy objective of below, but close to, 2%. The low interest rates were an issue for some savers. However, for them, it is not the nominal interest rates which we influence directly that are decisive, but rather the real interest rates – after inflation has been deducted – that count. In the past, there were very long periods in which real interest rates were significantly lower than today, simply because inflation was so high. Also, in the longer run, what is crucial for the real income of the savers is the state of the economy. A central bank has no influence on factors which determine the structural strength of an economy and thus the real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates. Standard: That’s not much help to savers today. Praet: In the medium to longer term, our monetary policy will certainly help savers. We’re doing our part to help the economy recover. This will bring the rate of inflation back to our objective and subsequently bring the level of interest rates back to normal. Therefore, the low interest rates may be a short-term pain for some, but a long-term gain for all. Everybody in Europe has an interest in us getting out of the current situation, which is marked by low inflation and low growth. We will succeed in doing so. But the crisis was so severe that this process is taking a number of years. Standard: Some economists say that it’ll be years before interest rates are higher. Praet: There are always Cassandras who speak badly about everything… Standard: Cassandra was right about her warnings. Praet: Yes, but prophecies that make people scared and become self-fulfilling can be dangerous. Standard: The ECB started buying government bonds on a massive scale in January 2016. Have you got any proof that the quantitative easing programme is taking effect? Praet: Yes. The first effect is that we have given a clear signal. When we lowered interest rates, credit conditions for companies in some countries rapidly improved. Now, with quantitative easing in the background, loans for firms and the government sector have become significantly cheaper overall.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  William C Dudley: Remarks at the CPMI’s 25th Anniversary Conference Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure’s 25th Anniversary Conference, Bank for International Settlements, Basel, 30 June 2015. *      *      * We have three distinguished panelists in this opening session – Claudio Borio, the head of the Monetary and Economic Department at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), William Coen, the Secretary General of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and Masa Kono, who is currently the Vice-Minister of International Affairs at the Japan Financial Services Agency and who earlier chaired the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) during the development of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI). They will offer their thoughts on how the role of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI) has changed and is likely to continue to evolve in its task of setting and helping implement global financial, operational and risk standards for the world’s key financial market infrastructures (FMI). Before I turn to our panelists, let me offer some brief comments on the evolution of the CPMI. As I see it, there have been three broad complementary trends that have been important in influencing the evolution of the CPMI and have contributed to its increased importance over time. As always, what I have to say represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1 The first trend has been the development of a global financial system. This has increased financial system interdependencies and, hence, the importance of harmonizing standards across national regulatory regimes. It also has made it more important to avoid regulatory arbitrage and race to the bottom types of behavior that could weaken the resiliency and robustness of the global financial market infrastructure. The second trend is the increasing importance of FMIs within the financial system. As trading across a more complex array of instruments and products proliferates, and as more trades are centrally cleared, well-managed FMIs play an increasingly important role within the financial system. The third trend stems directly from the first two. With the global financial system becoming more prominent and FMIs playing a bigger role within this global financial system, it has become ever more essential that major FMIs operate safely. When run well, they mitigate risk. But, run poorly, they could be a source of contagion and risk propagation throughout the global financial system. This means that the CPMI’s work has become much more critical in ensuring a safe and sound global financial system. The growing influence of the CPMI can be seen in its success in staying ahead of these trends. It was the CPMI’s analysis and standard-setting that led to the adoption of payment systems that provide “real-time gross settlement with intraday finality,” securities settlement systems that ensure “delivery versus payment,” and foreign exchange settlement systems that ensure “payment versus payment.” This fundamental evolution of systemically important payment and settlement systems was instrumental in mitigating significant sources of systemic risk and laying a solid foundation to support the increasingly global financial system. In parallel, it was the CPMI that first defined the concept and processes of “central bank oversight of payment and settlement systems” and implemented the associated principles for “central bank cooperation.” This also supported many central banks and securities regulators in their efforts to gain explicit legal responsibility and power to apply standards aimed at promoting broader “financial stability” and containing “systemic risk.” Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States is a good example of this. This means that many authorities now have greater capacity and responsibility to apply and enforce the PFMI as requirements, where previously a number of regulators were constrained to treating earlier standards merely 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  as “recommendations.” Taken together, we have made considerable progress in terms of the global regulatory regime to reflect the growing importance of FMIs and central counterparties (CCPs) within the financial system. Let me briefly list a few of the accomplishments of the PFMI: • They are now being globally adopted and implemented as mandatory, and the specific requirements themselves have been raised substantially. For example, there is a new, explicit liquidity standard to ensure that payments are made on time and in the right currency, and the cover 2 requirement for complex CCPs is much tougher than what came before it. • They also provide greater detail and scope, including more detailed guidance with respect to CCPs and trade repositories (TRs). • They are underpinned by a detailed disclosure framework, an agreed assessment methodology and a rigorous monitoring program to both promote consistency in how authorities have adopted and implemented the PFMI as well as, importantly, to promote consistency in outcomes. • They provide greater harmonization to avoid regulatory arbitrage and race to the bottom behaviors. • They include requirements and guidance for FMIs to implement their own viable recovery and orderly wind-down plans. As I see it, great progress has been made, but there is more work to do in a number of areas: • Greater harmonization and better cross-border mutual recognition practices; • CCP recovery and resilience as well as coordination with other authorities to ensure incentives are aligned; • Appropriate incentives for CCPs so that the profit motive does not conflict with having a safe system that can absorb large shocks without destabilizing the financial system; and • Availability of data in TRs on a cross-border basis to facilitate the development of a more complete picture of market activities and emerging risks. I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to chair the Committee during the period in which the PFMI were created. I recognize that this was just an initial step in the process, but it was an essential first step. Subsequent CPMI committees, under the leadership of Paul Tucker and Benoit Coeure, have been working with the other Basel Committees, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), IOSCO and individual country regulators to continue to take this effort forward. We have placed a lot of financial stability eggs in the FMI basket. It is important that we monitor and oversee that basket carefully. I would now like to turn the floor over to our first panelist, Claudio Borio. Claudio, the floor is yours, you have 10 minutes.  1 Shari Bower, Caren Cox, Alex Merle-Huet, John Rutigliano, Johanna Schwab, Larry Sweet and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks. 
    BIS central bankers’ speeches 1   Luis M Linde: Presentation of the Bank of Spain’s Annual Report for 2014 Testimony by Mr Luis M Linde, Governor of the Bank of Spain, before the Parliamentary Committee on Economic Affairs and Competitiveness, Madrid, 24 June 2015. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I appear before this Committee on the occasion of the presentation of the Banco de España Annual Report for 2014. Let me begin by reviewing developments in the Spanish economy, the factors underpinning its recovery and the economic policy challenges of strengthening recovery. I shall then address aspects relating to the start-up of the Banking Union and the situation of, and outlook for, the Spanish banking system. Economic situation and outlook In mid-2013, the Spanish economy initiated a recovery phase that firmed last year and has continued to do so in 2015 to date. In 2014, GDP grew at a rate of 1.4% while employment did so at 1.2%, the first positive figure since the start of the crisis. In its Quarterly Report to be published tomorrow, the Banco de España will present a new set of macroeconomic projections. According to these, the Spanish economy will grow at a rate of 3.1% on average in 2015, an upward revision of 0.3 pp on the projections published in March. On the basis of this change, activity is performing better than projected three months back. Following quarter-on-quarter growth in GDP of 0.9% in the first quarter, the latest information indicates that activity is expected to maintain a strong rate of expansion, whereby a further slight quickening in output is estimated in the second quarter, to 1% in quarterly terms. Average growth in the first half of the year, in annualised terms, is thus expected to be around 4%. The projections for the rest of 2015 and for next year point to continuing dynamism, with Spain clearly outpacing most of its euro area partners. However, this momentum might be slightly contained by the weakening of some of the expansionary impulses, such as the fall in oil prices and the depreciation of the euro. For 2016, the projections estimate average growth of 2.7%, with greater uncertainty naturally accompanying the longer time ahead involved. In terms of the composition of spending, the most recent phase of the recovery has been marked by the growing weight of national demand, which has replaced external demand as the main net contributor to growth. Foreseeably, in the near future, this pattern will continue, with a contribution by the external sector to the increase in GDP that is practically neutral in net terms. Exports, particularly to the euro area, are expected to post higher growth, while the tempo of imports will slacken somewhat. Turning to prices, inflation, which has been in negative territory virtually since the recovery began, has undergone a progressive correction since the start of this year, standing at –0.2% in May further to a rise in the energy component and a gradual pick-up in core inflation. The decline in prices in Spain is proving more marked than in the Monetary Union as a whole, meaning that the inflation differential will continue to help in bringing about an ongoing improvement in our economy’s competitiveness. Inflation might be running at a moderately positive rate at the end of 2015 owing to a combination of several factors. Firstly, the progressive petering out of the effect induced by the heavy fall in oil prices in the closing stretch of 2014 is expected to bring about an automatic rise in the energy component of the CPI in the closing months of this year. 
    2 BIS central bankers’ speeches   And further, the depreciation of the euro will impact non-energy goods and services prices. In any event, the persistence of considerable slack in the economy, i.e. of substantial unused capacity, means a mild recovery in the inflation rate over the next two years is to be expected. The factors underpinning growth The favourable growth outlook is underpinned, above all, by the restoring of macroeconomic equilibria. The progress made and the measures underpinning it have allowed the confidence of both external investors and of Spanish households and firms to be restored. Improved confidence has also benefited from the changes in certain external conditioning factors, such as those linked to the ECB’s monetary policy and to the progress in economic and monetary union, which have prompted an easing in financing conditions. On top of these are other more transitory effects, such as those linked to the low level of oil prices or to the depreciation of the euro. I shall continue with the analysis contained in the Annual Report, briefly reviewing the key factors behind the recovery. Budgetary consolidation Firstly, regarding public finances, the general government deficit met the objective set by the European Council (5.8% of GDP) for the third year running. In 2014, fiscal policy had a less restrictive impact than in the preceding years and was a less prominent conditioning factor of macroeconomic developments. The reduction in the deficit in 2014 came about as a result of the greater adjustment made at the central and local government levels, since most of the regional governments exceeded the targets set. The budgetary improvement was also the consequence of a similar-sized contribution by revenue and public spending (once the impact of the financial assistance to the banking system is stripped out of spending). The tax take progressively picked up during the year, in step with the cyclical improvement and the change in the composition of GDP. In turn, the budgetary consolidation measures and the cyclical improvement in the economy have brought about a decline in the public spending/GDP ratio, largely owing to the improvement in spending once interest on debt is discounted. Interest payments as a proportion of GDP held at a similar level to 2013, despite the significant decline in the Treasury’s financing costs, owing to the increase in public debt. The public debt/GDP ratio rose in 2014 to 97.7%, thereby meeting forecasts. The latest Updated Stability Programme (which confirms the deficit targets to 2017) presages a continuing increase in debt this year to 98.9% of GDP, with a reduction commencing in 2016, although the better growth now projected for 2015 may improve these projections.   
    BIS central bankers’ speeches 3   Private-sector deleveraging Secondly, there has been headway in correcting private-sector indebtedness. Spanish household debt stood at end-2014 at 71% of GDP, 10 pp above the euro area average, when in 2010 we were 20 pp above it; non-financial corporations’ debt stood at the end of last year at 92% of GDP, 8 pp above the euro area average, when in 2010 the gap was 35 pp. In the coming years, the nominal growth of the economy will make for a readier adjustment and will ease the pressure still exerted by past debts on new financing flows. Indeed, new lending was seen to expand in 2014, and this has continued into the opening months of 2015. Labour market and competitiveness Thirdly, some of the most visible and significant features of the current phase of recovery are the high rate of job creation and the reduction in unemployment by almost half a million people during 2014. The pick-up in employment is partly related to firms’ greater capacity to adapt their working conditions to the cyclical and competitive situation. This environment has helped usher in a period of wage moderation and an adjustment of relative costs relative to the euro area as a whole, which largely explains the gains in competitiveness recently attained by the Spanish economy. Turning to prices, the Annual Report pays particular attention to the factors underpinning the recent disinflationary phase in Spain. The analysis concludes that, beyond the influence the prolonged weakness of spending and the fall in oil prices may have had, there has been greater responsiveness by prices to changes in the economic situation, which might be attributed, at least in part, to the reforms in certain markets and services. Retaining this greater degree of flexibility in price- and wage-setting is vital so that, in the face of adverse shocks, adjustments may be made through relative prices and not at the expense of economic activity and employment, as has traditionally occurred in the Spanish economy in recent recessions. There has likewise been a notably sharp correction of the external imbalance, with external surpluses being attained in the past three years, albeit of a smaller amount in 2014. Nonetheless, the correction of the International Investment Position (IIP), a debtor position equivalent to 93.5% of GDP at the close of 2014, is proving very gradual, which denotes the need to maintain the gains in competitiveness achieved, so as to improve the current account balance and reduce our still-high level of external debt. The role of external conditioning factors Let me now refer to the external conditioning factors in the recovery of the Spanish economy. The world economy lost momentum in 2014, particularly so in the euro area. Euro area growth was very weak in the second and third quarters of the year and only thereafter did it begin to show somewhat greater strength. On this occasion, moreover, Germany and France – the area’s two biggest economies and two of our biggest trading partners – were also affected. The latest ECB projections point to a moderate recovery, whereby the area’s GDP is expected to grow 1.5% this year and 1.9% in 2016. These are, then, clearly lower rates than those projected for our economy. Other external developments have provided a boost to activity. I have already mentioned the fall in oil prices. Unquestionably, though, the most durable positive external impulses stemmed from the ECB’s monetary policy and the start-up of the Banking Union. 
    4 BIS central bankers’ speeches   Throughout last year and in 2015 to date, the ECB has continued to deepen its expansionary monetary policy stance. Once again, it has combined conventional measures, cutting official interest rates and placing the deposit facility in negative territory, with other, unconventional measures, such as a new private-sector credit-linked lending programme and the launch of an ambitious plan to purchase private- and public-sector securities, which is expected to run until September 2016 and, in any event, until inflation resumes a path more in keeping with its medium-term objective, namely around 2% for the ECB. These expansionary monetary impulses, along with the expectations of a change in the US monetary policy stance and of an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, have depreciated the euro and reduced the Spanish economy’s financing costs. The market fragmentation caused by the crisis may be considered to have been reversed. Such fragmentation was hampering the full transmission of the expansionary monetary measures to our economy. The start-up of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the first step of the Banking Union, has played an important role in this process of financial normalisation. The start-up of the Single Supervisory Mechanism In November last year the SSM commenced operating and, since then, with the participation and support of the national authorities, the ECB has taken control of banking supervision throughout the Monetary Union. As a prior step, an ambitious comprehensive assessment of European banks was undertaken in 2014, whose positive results contributed to increasing investor confidence in the European banking system. As is known, our banks comfortably passed the test, confirming the favourable results of the restructuring and recapitalisation programme carried out in 2012 and 2013 with the agreement and assistance of our EU partners. The comprehensive assessment of significant euro area banks was twin-pronged, entailing an asset quality review and stress tests to determine banks’ resilience in hypothetical adverse scenarios. The results obtained by Spanish banks were favourable. First, I should highlight the fact that Spanish banks are those with fewest adjustments to make as a result of the asset quality review which, unlike the stress tests, is not based on hypotheses but on a detailed balance sheet review. As regards solvency, only one bank stood slightly below the thresholds set in one part of the exercise and, in any event, that same bank had already adopted capital-strengthening measures in 2014 on a scale far exceeding that needed to cover the shortfall identified. In the course of 2014, both the ECB and the national authorities made a significant effort to address the challenge posed by adaptation to the new supervisory framework. In this respect, to make our joint work easier, the Banco de España has reorganised its Directorate General of Banking Supervision, creating a structure that mirrors that of the ECB’s SSM. In 2015, its first year of operation, the SSM has defined a list of priorities, bearing in mind the environment and the main risks to the banking sector. These include most notably profitability. European credit institutions have operated in recent years under adverse macroeconomic conditions. In a market characterised by low interest rates, bank margins have been subject to downward pressure which, combined with asset impairment losses, has affected their capacity to obtain profits. One of the priorities of European supervision for 2015 is to identify the determinants of profitability and to attempt to detect aggressive strategies contrary to financial stability. In the prudential realm, one of the main challenges is for banks to adapt to the stricter capital requirements of the new Basel III solvency regime. The SSM, like the Banco de España in 
    BIS central bankers’ speeches 5   previous years, issued a recommendation of prudence to banks in connection with the distribution of its dividends. In our case, having regard to the difficult economic and banking situation in 2013, dividend payments above 25% of profits were broadly restricted; the European supervisor’s recommendation imposes restrictions solely on banks facing a tighter situation in terms of solvency. One priority matter is the review of the national discretionality and options permitted under European solvency regulations, in order to harmonise the legislation applicable to SSM-supervised banks. The review has begun recently and is being jointly tackled by the ECB and the national competent authorities. The second element of the Banking Union, prepared in 2014 with a view to its entry into force in 2015, is the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), which establishes a common European framework for the restructuring and resolution of credit institutions. The aim is, should the case arise, to provide for the management of situations of bank non-viability while preserving the stability of the financial system, minimising public financial support, safeguarding depositors and ensuring the continuity of the critical economic functions of the banks in question. All of the foregoing might influence the management of bank balance sheets and have a particular bearing on the composition of their liabilities, part of which must be eligible for absorbing losses and for their recapitalisation. The SRM comprises two elements: the Single Resolution Board and the Single Resolution Fund. The latter, by means of contributions from the banking sector, is expected to amount to €55 billion in 2024. In the national arena, the recently approved legislation on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment services firms distinguishes between pre-emptive resolution functions, which correspond to the Banco de España in the case of credit institutions and to the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) in that of investment services firms, and enforcement resolution functions, attributable to the Fund for the Orderly Restructuring of the Banking Sector (FROB), which sits moreover on the SRM Board, with the Banco de España having observer status. Performance of credit institutions in 2014 Before concluding, I shall review the recent performance of Spanish credit institutions. The year 2014 saw an improvement in financial conditions and a recovery in activity and employment. Lending to the resident private sector in Spain continued to shrink in 2014, in line with the need for the deleveraging of the Spanish economy; that said, the rate of decline of lending eased (from 8.3% in 2013 to 6.4% in 2014). At firms not engaging in construction and real estate activities, credit fell much less, shifting from a negative rate of 9% in 2013 to a still-negative rate of 1.5% in 2014. The figures available for 2015 suggest that the year will conclude with credit running at a rate of change very close to zero or in positive territory for the first time since 2009. One key aspect in 2014 was the fact that non-performing loans (NPLs) to the resident private sector fell both in absolute terms (by more than €24 billion) and in terms of the NPL ratio, which declined by almost 1 pp to 12.9%. In 2015 to date, this trend is holding, as NPLs have fallen to 12.3%. Resident private-sector refinanced exposures have fallen by 4.5% and account for 14% of the total, a proportion still highly influenced by forborne exposures to real estate development and construction companies. It is also worth pointing out that households and non-financial corporations are changing the composition of their savings in response to the very low interest rate environment, meaning that bank deposits have declined while units in investment funds have increased significantly. 
    6 BIS central bankers’ speeches   Spanish banks’ attributed profits in 2014 increased by close to 34%, continuing the recovery initiated in 2013. Despite the backdrop of declining credit and low interest rates, net interest income rose by almost 5% owing to financing costs falling at a swifter pace than the return on financial products. Also, the containment of operating expenses and the decline in asset impairment losses have contributed to the improvement in results. However, the persistence of the environment of very low interest rates and the presence of a significant volume of non-productive assets will continue to bear down on the income statement. That will lead banks to reflect on a sustainable business model, involving the application of new technologies, new activities and an office and staffing structure better tailored to attaining this model. In December 2014, the top-quality common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of our banks stood at 11.8%. This ratio rises to 13.6% for total capital. Both figures amply exceed the regulatory minimum levels. Even if the standards scheduled to be in force from 2018 – when Basel III becomes fully applicable – were to be applied, these percentages would remain above the minimum levels (9.9% and 12.1%, respectively). Moreover, the recourse by banks to Eurosystem funds continues to fall. Notwithstanding this positive assessment, Spanish banks must continue strengthening their capital and their loss-absorption capacity in order to withstand the new macroeconomic environment, heightened competition and the new, more demanding and complex regulatory framework. Conclusions Overall, the outlook for the Spanish economy has improved in the recent period. Its degree of vulnerability to potential shocks has progressively diminished as headway has been made in correcting its imbalances, strengthening economic activity and generating employment. Nonetheless, the effects of the crisis have been very serious and condition our economy’s growth capacity in the short and medium term. Accordingly, economic policy measures should be geared to shoring up the foundations of the recovery and to seeing through the correction of imbalances. The cyclical situation in the euro area and in Spain means the maintenance of a demand-side policy mix supportive of the recovery is foreseeable. In the case of monetary policy, this is because of the commitments assumed by the ECB, which I referred to earlier. And in the case of budgetary policy, because adhering to the fiscal consolidation path will be compatible with a progressively less contractionary or more neutral contribution by the public sector to growth. In the current economic circumstances, it will continue to be necessary to complement these measures with reforms aimed at enhancing competitiveness and lowering the obstacles to a more rapid absorption of unemployment. Such actions take on particular significance in a situation like the present in which the aggregate level of debt in the economy is still high and further gains in competitiveness come up against a less propitious environment, given the low inflation in the euro area and the envisaged low growth in productivity. Reducing unemployment, which is at a very high rate despite the favourable developments in Social Security registrations and the reduction in registered unemployment, remains our major economic policy task. In this connection, wage bargaining must allow for the different situation of different firms and sectors to be taken into account, avoiding as far as possible the return to now-superseded wage indexation practices. Considerable progress has been made in correcting the fiscal imbalance, without forgetting the constraints that such a high level of public debt imposes. In the short and medium run, 
    BIS central bankers’ speeches 7   perseverance with fiscal consolidation on the basis of a growth-conducive revenue and spending mix that ensures compliance with the Budgetary Stability Law will be unavoidable. I should like to conclude with some thoughts on the challenges posed by long-term growth for the Spanish economy. In Spain, as in most of the countries affected, the crisis has had a large-scale impact on the level of output, as a result of sizeable capital and job destruction. The future growth of the Spanish economy will be influenced by how we manage to overcome these effects, but also by the capacity to raise productivity, whose low pace of growth has continuously affected us. Against this background, it is vital to continue with and deepen reforms that boost investment, lower the obstacles to competition and remove the barriers preventing a suitable reallocation of productive resources towards the firms and sectors with the highest growth potential. The Annual Report concludes that these barriers are the outcome of various factors: inappropriate regulations, small firm-size, limited regional and sectoral job mobility, a degree of educational mismatch between labour supply and demand, and insufficient innovative capacity. Overcoming these constraints calls for responses that are not always straightforward or simple either in technical or political terms. But it should be stressed that these reforms can bring about positive synergies with the expansionary monetary policy being pursued by the ECB, even in the short term, owing to their impact on growth expectations. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jens Weidmann: Of credit and capital – what is needed for an efficient and resilient financial system? Speech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the IIF (Institute of International Finance) Europe Summit, Frankfurt am Main, 25 June 2015. *      *      * 1.  Introduction Ladies and gentlemen Thank you for inviting me to speak here before you today. The former Italian President Sandro Pertini is quoted as joking that speeches were always harmful. “Before lunch they spoil people’s appetite, and after lunch they spoil people’s digestion.” With this in mind, I’ll try to be brief so that the immediate effect of my speech should – hopefully – be limited. But lunch is actually an excellent cue, for it calls to mind one of the fundamental principles of economics: “There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” Interestingly, though, the phrase was coined not by an economist, but by the American science fiction writer Robert A Heinlein. Although it may have come from the pen of a science fiction author, this adage has proven to be far more durable than many theories put forward by economists. And the fact that you now have to sit through my speech would strongly suggest that Robert Heinlein might have been onto something here. That something is a pretty fundamental insight: that each and every economic decision involves a trade-off that needs to be factored into that decision. As such, economic decision-making is about weighing benefits and costs, about striking a delicate balance. Take central banks, for instance. The task of monetary policy is to find the interest rate that neither chokes off the economy nor causes it to overheat. Only in balance will inflation be low and stable – and this is usually a central bank’s mandate. Economist Knut Wicksell termed this rate the “natural rate of interest”. And striking the right balance is the core challenge with regard to another central bank function as well – its role as lender of last resort. Overly restrictive provision of liquidity in times of financial turmoil might fail to quell the upheaval – possibly causing a conflagration. But providing too much liquidity for too long might end up causing problems as well. If non-viable banks are kept on life support with central bank money, they will go on to make evergreen loans to non-viable companies – a situation which heightens the risk of future problems in the banking system. And if the liquidity is channelled towards sovereigns that find it otherwise hard to access the markets, we run the risk of blurring the lines between monetary and fiscal policy. Greece is a case in point here. The emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) – which was originally conceived as a temporary source of liquidity for financially sound banks in return for good collateral – has been provided for a protracted period of time and has become the banks’ only source of funding. This casts doubt on their financial solidity. The latter is especially undermined by Greek policy decisions that have sparked capital flight and large-scale cash withdrawals. Banks receiving ELA should be urged to do their utmost to improve their liquidity situation and be prevented from worsening it further by rolling over illiquid T-bills of their sovereign. Against this background, it should be clear to all the parties to the current negotiations that the Eurosystem must not provide bridge financing to Greece even in anticipation of later disbursements. When banks without access to the markets buy debt of a sovereign which is 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  likewise locked out of the market, taking recourse to ELA raises serious monetary financing concerns. Respecting the core principles upon which our monetary union is built is not a matter of dogmatic German stubbornness, but a key policy condition for long-term economic prosperity in the euro area and for maintaining popular support for the historic project which European integration no doubt is. Besides the balance that monetary policymakers themselves have to strike, there is another state of balance they count on to maintain price stability – a well-balanced financial system. 2.  Credit and capital: Competition or complementarity? Let us have a closer look into the relationship between bank-based financing and market-based financing. Does one detract from the other, or can one deliver benefits where the other one comes up short? To put it succinctly: Are credit and capital competitive or complementary? The debate on the superiority of bank-based or market-based financial systems is decades, if not centuries old.1  One notable development that sparked this debate was the differences in growth between Germany and the UK in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Some argued that it was the pre-eminence of banks and their close relationship with their clients that facilitated the rapid growth of Germany’s manufacturing industry. Others pointed out that while manufacturing growth in Germany was faster, overall growth rates were broadly the same. Similar arguments are being made today. In general, proponents of the bank-based system argue that banks are better suited to dealing with information asymmetries, as their long-standing ties with their clients allow them to glean information about firms and managers. This information leads to more efficient capital allocation and better corporate governance. The long-standing ties of banks to their clients deliver a quality of information exclusively to the bank. Naturally, it is inclined to keep this information to itself. In contrast, financing via capital markets quickly disseminates information on firms, as Joseph Stiglitz2 pointed out. This may, however, stunt incentives for the individual investor to acquire private information on the soundness of creditors. Proponents of market-based systems make the opposite claim: large and liquid financial markets strengthen rather than weaken incentives to gather information about a firm, as the information can be used on a grander scale.3  And rather than banks’ using their private information on firms to channel resources to those which are most productive, they might use the information to shield their existing clients from competition.4  At first sight, the two views seem irreconcilable. On closer inspection, though, the contradictions begin to disappear – regardless if one takes the perspective of the individual firm or a broader macroeconomic view.                                                 1  Levine, R.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Whether a bank credit, a bond or an equity issue is preferable from the perspective of the individual firm depends to a large extent on what stage the firm is at in its economic life cycle. Or put simply: If it is an innovative start-up, it might benefit from the expertise of a venture capital fund. If it is a small firm with long-standing ties to its bank, chances are that a bank credit is best. But if it is a large, developed firm, a bond issue might be the route to take. So from the perspective of the individual firm, the answer to the question “credit or capital” is “it all depends”. But maybe the answer is more clear-cut when taking a systemic perspective? Well, there are some indications that market-based systems might be more procyclical than bank-based systems.5 The more pronounced asset price booms and busts in market-based systems might be the explanation for that. But we know from the extensive literature on the financial accelerator effect that procyclicality besets bank-based systems as well. And while research conducted by the Bank for International Settlements has shown that bank-based systems are more effective in smoothing the impact of “normal” business cycle fluctuations, market-based systems allow for a speedier recovery after financial crises.6 That the US economy made up lost ground more quickly than Europe after the Great Recession, even though the crisis originated in the US, is a case in point. Therefore, the answer to the question is not an “either/or”. From a macroeconomic perspective, credit and capital are complementary. Little would be gained by simply substituting one leg for another. We need to supplement Europe’s financial system, not supplant it. This does not mean that the European financial system of the future will look exactly like the American one, for instance. The structure of the financial system reflects the corporate structure of an economy – and in an economy with a comparatively high share of small firms, like the European one, one would expect a prevalence of bank-based financing. Another question is whether the large proportion of very small firms in Europe is optimal. Research strongly suggests that the answer is no: Larger firms are, on average, more productive and are better placed to compete in export markets.7  Unfortunately, the growth of small, innovative enterprises is hindered in some European countries by a plethora of red tape that kicks in when firms reach a certain size. In France, for instance, many regulations become binding when a firm reaches a size of 50 employees. Other size-contingent regulations exist in other countries such as Portugal or Italy, where the threshold is 15 employees. What these regulations all have in common is that they deter firms from expanding. Therefore, they are a drag on growth. Structural reforms that remove these barriers are urgently needed. But they will only have their full effect if firms can find a suitable form of financing as well. And this is why we need to remove the impediments to a fully integrated European capital market.                                                 5  Leroy, A (2014), “Credit Procyclicality and Financial Structure in the EU”.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3.  Capital markets union These impediments still abound, and some of them are addressed by the European Commission’s proposals for the design of a European capital markets union: the market for high-quality securitisation is one example. Other areas for early action include private placements, crowd-funding or the harmonisation of prospectuses. Eliminating these impediments would be a step forward towards a more prosperous Europe, which is why the Commission’s initiative deserves our support. With a view to the longer run, however, we will probably need to go further. Harmonising insolvency laws across Europe, for instance, would improve the integration of capital markets as well – and of venture capital markets in particular. 3.1  Tax deductibility of interest In addition to the existing impediments, the development of equity markets in general suffers from what the Economist has recently called “the great distortion at the heart of the world’s economy”: the preferential tax treatment of debt vis-à-vis equity. While interest is tax-deductible, equity is not. Removing this bias in taxation would encourage companies to strengthen their equity base. And this is not only important for the development of equity markets, but spills over to the other side of the financial system, i.e. banks. A study8 by IMF economists suggests that abolishing the preferential tax treatment of debt would raise average unweighted bank equity by 2.2 to 4.2 percentage points – implying no less than a doubling of the leverage ratio. Even though the authors caution that the effect is likely to be lower for the biggest banks, these numbers are sizeable by any measure, especially considering that the proposed Basel III leverage ratio is 3%. Doing away with the preferential tax treatment of debt could therefore provide a major boost to financial stability. 3.2  Improved risk-sharing But in Europe, in particular, the benefits of stronger equity markets extend even further. It might be the single most important step we can take towards bringing Europe closer to an optimal currency area. Economists like Robert Mundell and Peter Kenen have highlighted the importance of effective risk-sharing arrangements for the functioning of a monetary union. In public debates the most frequent (and most contested) proposal is to strengthen fiscal risk-sharing arrangements. But this debate runs the risk of missing the bigger picture. In the United States, for example, studies9 show that fiscal policy cushions only 10% to 20% of economic shocks, so that a local income shock does not translate into a drop in consumption to the same extent. Integrated capital markets play a far larger role – especially integrated equity markets, which smooth out around 40% of the cyclical fluctuations among the US federal states. Another share of around 25% is cushioned via the credit markets. Altogether, around 80% of a given                                                 8  de Mooij, Ruud A. and Keen, M. and Orihara, M., Taxation, Bank Leverage, and Financial Crises (February 2013).

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  economic shock in the US is absorbed before it can affect consumption. Studies for Canada yield similar results.10  In Europe, the picture looks different. Here, it is mainly credit markets that cushion economic shocks – and they are not very effective in doing so. Altogether, only around 40% of a given shock is absorbed before it can affect consumption.11 Increasing the share of capital markets and integrating them across borders would therefore help improve risk sharing in Europe and also protect monetary policy by containing economic divergence. The recently published “Five Presidents” report on the future of the euro area underlines the importance of capital markets with regard to strengthening risk-sharing arrangements, too. The report also proposes establishing a fiscal risk-sharing mechanism in the longer run. But extending common liability would have to be balanced by a commensurate shift towards European control; otherwise, the incentives for fiscal prudence will get out of kilter. Here, the sequence is of the essence: Shifting fiscal control and intervention rights to the European level must come first; after that, the mutualisation of liability may follow. But let’s be frank here – the Greek drama has eroded public and political support for further transfers of national sovereignty to the European level as it has raised doubts over some parties’ determination to assume their responsibility for preserving European monetary union as a stability union that is firmly grounded on a set of commonly agreed rules. So it’s crucial for further solidarity to be linked to a strong conditionality and for agreements to be adhered to. This holds true not only because the root causes of the Greek problems will otherwise never be fixed, but also for the stability of monetary union itself. By the same token, a European deposit insurance system seems feasible only if the policy areas that influence the health of banks are European responsibilities. Otherwise, it will open the door to a situation in which the burden of bad national policy choices can be shifted to all Europeans creating severe moral hazard problems. 4.  The sovereign-banking nexus Ladies and gentlemen, strengthening capital markets will bring about tangible benefits only if we reduce barriers to their functioning, not if we introduce new distortions to shift activity from banks to markets. By the same token, the regulation of banks will produce lasting success with regard to fostering financial stability only if we harness the disciplining forces of the market. Implicit subsidies and bail-out expectations have to be a thing of the past. As Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has put it: “To make the system fairer, the days when banks privatised gains but socialised losses must end.” Eventually, this means tackling the overly tight embrace of banks and sovereigns, as this compounds the issue of systemic relevance. The Basel III liquidity and capital requirements as well as the recently introduced resolution regimes are major steps towards cutting off the channel of contagion from banks to sovereigns. In Europe, the banking union that includes the SSM and the SRM goes a long way towards making it more likely that stumbling banks will not be rescued at the taxpayer’s expense.                                                 10  Balli, F.

   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In Germany, the government has presented draft legislation specifically designed to boost German banks’ bail-inable debt and steps in this direction are welcome. But if we want to sever the link between banks and sovereigns for good, we need to stop contagion from sovereigns to banks as well. And this means ending the preferential regulatory treatment of sovereign debt. In the past, the call to end the preferential treatment of sovereign debt was dealt with in the same way as some people see taking out the garbage. We all know it has to be done some time, but for now, let’s pretend the chore doesn’t exist. Unfortunately, at least in the euro area, things have started to get smelly. In contrast to other jurisdictions, the Eurosystem is, for good reason, forbidden to act as lender of last resort for governments. The risk profile of euro-area sovereign debt is therefore different – and Greece illustrates that. Acknowledging this fact with regard to regulation would make the monetary union more stable, as sovereign restructuring would cease to be a systemic event. To achieve this aim, sovereign debt needs to be backed by capital, and exposure to a single sovereign must be capped just as is the case for any private debtor. I welcome the fact that the regulatory treatment of sovereign debt was acknowledged as a major topic by the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors at our meeting in Dresden and that it is now being discussed by the Basel Committee. While it is sensible to conduct this review in a “careful and holistic manner”, this should not be allowed to lead to procrastination. 5.  Banker’s code of conduct Adequate regulation is crucial if we are to strengthen the leg on which Europe’s financial system has hitherto rested. But not everything can be dealt with by regulation. It is a bank’s culture that lays the ground for misdemeanour. And the influence of regulation on a bank’s culture is indirect and limited at best. Out of enlightened self-interest, banks should take the initiative and do everything possible to establish a culture in which responsibility is rewarded and recklessness rejected. A banker’s code of conduct, for instance, might be helpful in this respect. Introducing a voluntary self-commitment might overcome banks’ qualms about embracing cultural change within their respective institutions. Still, Mark Carney is also right in saying: “This is a major opportunity for the industry to establish common standards of market practice. But if firms and their staff fail to take this opportunity, more restrictive regulation is inevitable.” 6.  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude. The crisis has shown that Europe’s one-legged bank-based financial system could do with another fully developed leg – market-based finance. Doing away with the impediments that hamper the full integration of European capital markets is key not only to diversifying sources of funding in a crisis, but also to strengthening the risk-sharing arrangements a monetary union requires. By the same token, the regulatory gaps that still amount to implicit subsidies for banks must be removed once and all without allowing the emergence of unregulated systemic entities elsewhere. Banks provide important services to society, and many banks do not deserve the reputation the banking industry has gained during the crisis. However, unless banking becomes an 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  industry that is more similar to others with regard to market entrance, exit, and power, further regulatory steps are necessary, especially in terms of resolving the “too big to fail” issue. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stanley Fischer: Supervisory stress testing of large systemic financial institutions Speech by Mr Stanley Fischer, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Sveriges Riksbank Macroprudential Conference, Stockholm, Sweden, 24 June 2015. *      *      * It’s a pleasure to take part in the Riksbank Macroprudential Conference and I thank the organizers for inviting me to participate in the conference, and particularly in this panel on stress testing. Stress testing has become a cornerstone of a new approach to regulation and supervision of the largest financial institutions in the United States. The Federal Reserve’s first supervisory stress test was the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, known as the SCAP. Conducted in 2009 during the depths of the financial crisis, the SCAP marked the first time the U.S. bank regulatory agencies had conducted a supervisory stress test simultaneously across the largest banking firms. The results clearly demonstrated the value of simultaneous, forward-looking supervisory assessments of capital adequacy under stressed conditions. The SCAP was also a key contributor to the relatively rapid restoration of the financial health of the U.S. banking system. The Fed’s approach to stress testing of the largest and most systemic financial institutions has evolved since the SCAP, but several key elements persist to this day.1 These elements include, first, supervisory stress scenarios applicable to all firms; second, defined consequences for firms deemed to be insufficiently capitalized; and third, public disclosure of the results. The Fed has subsequently conducted five stress test exercises that built on the success of SCAP, while making some important improvements to the stress test processes. The first key innovation was the development of supervisory models and processes that allow the Fed to evaluate independently whether banks are sufficiently resilient to continue to lend to consumers and to businesses under adverse economic and financial conditions. This innovation took place over the course of several exercises and was made possible by the extensive collection of data from the banks. These data have allowed supervisors to build models that are more sensitive to stress scenarios and better define the riskiness of the firms’ different businesses and exposures. The second innovation since the SCAP was the use of the supervisory stress test as a key input into the annual supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy at the largest bank holding companies. The crisis demonstrated the importance of forward-looking supervision that accounted for the possibility of negative outcomes. By focusing on forward-looking post-stress capital ratios, stress testing provides an assessment of a firm’s capital adequacy that is complementary to regulatory capital ratios, which reflect the firm’s performance to date. Although we view this new approach to capital assessment as a significant improvement over previous practices, we are aware that the true test of this new regime will come only if another period of significant financial or economic stress were to materialize-which is to say that we will not have a strong test of the effectiveness of stress testing until the stress tests undergo a real world stress test. The same comment, mutatis mutandis, applies to the overall changes in methods of bank regulation and supervision made since September 15, 2008.                                                 1 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Fed to conduct a supervisory stress test for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, and for nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for Fed supervision. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Third, supervisory stress testing has been on the leading edge of a movement toward greater supervisory transparency. Since the SCAP, the Fed has steadily increased the transparency around its stress testing processes, methodologies, and results. Before the crisis, releasing unfavorable supervisory information about particular firms was unthinkable-for fear of setting off runs on banks. However, the release of the SCAP results helped to calm markets during the crisis by reducing uncertainty about firm solvency. Indeed, only one of the 10 firms deemed to have a capital shortfall was unable to close the identified gap on the private markets. Our experience to date has been that transparency around the stress testing exercise improves the credibility of the exercise and creates accountability both for firms and supervisors. That said, too much transparency can also have potentially negative consequences, an idea to which I will turn shortly. With the benefit of five years of experience, the Fed is continuing to assess its stress testing program, and to make appropriate changes. Examples of such changes to date include the assumption of default by each firm’s largest counterparty and the assumption that firms would not curtail lending to consumers and businesses, even under severely adverse conditions. As part of that assessment process, we are also currently seeking feedback from the industry, market analysts, and academics about the program. Supervisory stress testing is not a static exercise and must adapt to a changing economic and financial environment and must incorporate innovations in modeling technology. Work is currently underway on adapting the stress testing framework to accommodate firms that have not traditionally been subject to these tests. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Fed to conduct stress tests on non-bank financial institutions that have been designated as systemically important by the FSOC-the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Three of the currently designated financial institutions are global insurance companies. While distress at these firms poses risks to financial stability, particularly during a stressful period, certain sources of risk to these firms are distinct from the risks banking organizations face. A key aspect of this ongoing work includes adapting our current stress testing framework and scenarios to ensure that the tests for non-bank SIFIs-systemically important financial institutions-are appropriate. Another area where work continues-and will likely always continue-is the Fed’s ongoing research aimed at improving our ability to estimate losses and revenues under stress. Supervisors have both to develop new approaches that push the state of the art in stress testing and to respond as new modeling techniques are developed or as firm activities and risk concentrations evolve over time. For example, forecasting how a particular bank’s revenue may respond to a severe macroeconomic recession can be challenging, and we continue to seek ways to enhance our ability to do so. Supervisory stress testing models and methodologies have to evolve over time in order to better capture salient emerging risks to financial firms and the system as a whole. However, the framework cannot simply be expanded to include more and more aspects of reality. For example, incorporating feedback from financial system distress to the real economy is a complex and difficult modelling challenge. Whether we recognize it or not, the standard solution to a complex modeling challenge is to simplify-typically to the minimum extent possible-aspects of the overall modelling framework. However, incorporating feedback into the stress test framework may require simplifying aspects of the framework to a point where it is less able to capture the risks to individual institutions. Even so, one can imagine substantial gains from continued research on stress testing’s role in macroprudential supervision and our understanding of risks to the financial system, such as knock-on effects, contagion, fire sales, and the interaction between capital and liquidity during a crisis. Finally, let me close by addressing a question that often arises about the use of a supervisory stress test, such as those conducted by the Fed, with common scenarios and 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  models. Such a test may create the possibility of, in former Chairman Bernanke’s words, a “model monoculture,” in which all models are similar and all miss the same key risks.2 Such a culture could possibly create vulnerabilities in the financial system. At the Fed we try to address this issue, in part, through appropriate disclosure about the supervisory stress test. We have published information about the overall framework employed in various aspects of the supervisory stress test, but not the full details that banks could use to manage to the test. This-making it easier to game the test-is the potential negative consequence of transparency that I alluded to earlier. We also value different approaches for designing scenarios and conducting stress tests. In the United States, in addition to supervisory stress testing, large financial firms are required to conduct their own stress tests, using their own models and stress scenarios that capture their unique risks.3 In evaluating each bank’s capital planning process, supervisors focus on how well banks’ internal scenarios and models capture their unique risks and business models. We expect firms to determine the risks inherent to their businesses, their risk-appetite, and to make business decisions on that basis. And that is a good place to stop. Thank you.                                                 2 Ben S.

However, only bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to the supervisory stress test and an evaluation of their capital planning process. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s March 2015 Monetary Policy Report Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, of the Monetary Policy Report before the Finance Committee of the Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 30 March 2015. *      *      * The Monetary Policy Report of March 2015 can be found at http://www.bcentral.cl. Accompanying charts can be found on the Central Bank of Chile’ website. Introduction Mr. President of the Finance Committee of the Senate, senator Andrés Zaldívar, senators members of this Committee, ladies, gentlemen, I am grateful for your invitation to present the vision of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile about the recent macroeconomic developments, their prospects and implications for monetary policy. This vision is detailed in our Monetary Policy Report (IPoM) of March 2015. But first and foremost, a few words of solidarity towards my fellow citizens that have recently suffered Nature’s wrath. The images and stories we have been receiving of the catastrophe that has swept across our country’s north are devastating and fill us with concern. In the past few months, inflation has exceeded December’s forecasts, and it is stubbornly above 4 percent. This Report’s baseline scenario also estimates a slower return to the target range than foreseen at the end of 2014. The depreciation of the peso continues to be the main factor behind the price dynamics, which, coupled with widespread indexation and a tighter than expected labor market, has pushed the core measure, i.e. the CPI excluding foodstuffs and energy, CPIEFE, from 4.3 to 4.7 percent annually between November and February. However, the lower oil price in international markets and its pass-through to domestic prices helped to moderate annual growth in CPI inflation, which went from 5.5 percent in November to 4.4 percent in February (figure 1). Recent inflation figures have taken the market by surprise, as it had assumed a clearly downward position with respect to the behavior of prices, even below our predictions in the December Report. Thus, the market expectation for inflation at the end of 2015 has been revised to somewhat above 3 percent, as has been inflation one year out. Expectations two years out remain anchored in 3 percent (figure 2). On the contrary, output and expenditure have evolved as forecast in December. Again this time the baseline scenario I will be sharing with you in a moment foresees a gradual recovery that will gain strength towards the second half of this year. Consistently with this scenario and the Board’s statement, market expectations for the monetary policy rate (MPR) have ruled out new cuts and, in some cases, point at a cycle of increases beginning late this year. In what follows I will describe the macroeconomic scenario we believe to be the most likely for the coming quarters, and its associated risks. Macroeconomic scenario The external environment and related risks remain largely determined by the impending monetary normalization process in the United States. Changes in expectations about when and how fast it will finally occur have affected world financial markets significantly. By contrast, in the Eurozone and other developed and emerging economies, monetary policy has become more expansionary, largely responding to the lower inflation figures and lower 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  medium-term inflation outlook. Such scenario is quite opposite to what we are seeing in Chile and Latin America in general. The Eurozone showed a more stable output trajectory towards the end of 2014, driven by Germany. Preliminary first-quarter figures suggest that Germany will continue to lead the bloc. It is also worth mentioning that in 2014 Spain posted positive GDP figures after three years in recession. Meanwhile, Italy and France continue to show meager results. All in all, in the past few months the region’s growth prospects have improved. In our baseline scenario, we expect the Eurozone to grow 1.5 percent this year, up from 1 percent in December. Still, there are some risks relating to the political situation, especially what may happen in Greece. About Latin America, there is a marked deterioration of the region’s economies, which is compounded with lower commodity prices and in some countries, public and private expenditure imbalances. So while the main economies in the region grew on average nearly 4 percent between 2010 and 2013, in 2014 they barely grew 0.7 percent in 2014 and are expected to grow by 0.8 percent this year. By countries, the biggest correction goes to the Brazilian forecast, which the market expects to post a GDP drop of 0.7 in 2015, its worst in several years. The greater relative strength of the United States, plus the ever closer beginning of its monetary policy normalization, has prompted a substantial appreciation of the dollar in recent quarters. For sure, news about the situation of the US economy plus the Fed’s statement has caused important swings in the dollar price in the past few weeks. This has reflected in large movements in most currencies around the world. As for the Chilean peso, in the middle of March it was trading above 640 units to the dollar, to later drop to near 620 pesos per dollar at the statistical cutoff of this Report (figure 3). The peso depreciation cycle that began in 2013 stands out as the longest in the last decade and it occurs in the context of a gradual economic slowdown and not a sharp recession. This is one of the main reasons behind inflation remaining above 4 percent. The data indicate that the pass-through coefficient from the exchange rate to inflation has been in line with historic patterns, although in the upper part of available estimates. Besides, the peso depreciation has had different timing than most emerging or commodity exporting economies. The earlier adjustment of the Chilean economy, in terms of both private expenditure and the monetary policy reaction, meant that for the larger part of 2014 our currency was one of the most depreciated globally. Subsequently, as the rest of the emerging economies entered a more marked adjustment cycle, those differences narrowed and the peso even appreciated in multilateral terms (figure 4). As of March, the real exchange rate is somewhat above its average for the last two decades (figure 5). Domestic activity has behaved as foreseen in December, although last year closed with somewhat higher growth than forecast in the previous Report: 1.9 percent. Revisions to earlier figures and a somewhat stronger fourth-quarter growth explain this result. Partial first-quarter figures continue to reveal moderate growth, but definitely better than the figures it showed since mid- 2014. On the demand side, there is no big news either with respect to the end of last year. Aside from specific factors, consumption and investment remain weak. Durable consumption and investment in machinery and equipment continue to grow at low or negative annual rates, albeit with some marginal stability. Anyway, it is worth noting the greater impulse from fiscal spending, particularly public investment, and the positive effect of the peso depreciation in the productive performance of some tradable sectors. The labor market continues to show more strength than previously foreseen. The unemployment rate, despite a marginal increase, is still low. Annual growth in salaried employment has picked up again in recent months, although job creation in the most cycle-sensitive sectors has remained slow. Meanwhile, nominal wages continue to grow at a strong pace, partly because they are generally indexed to past inflation (figure 6). Although the low 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  level of unemployment seems to conflict with the state of the business cycle, there are some structural factors that might explain the unemployment rates below historic averages, such as changes in the demographic composition of the labor force (figure 7). Turning to our projections, in the baseline scenario GDP will grow in 2015 more than it did in 2014 and will stand between 2.5 and 3.5 percent, not very different from the December forecast. In this projection, GDP growth will remain below the medium-term growth estimate, which we place between 4 and 4.5 percent. The baseline scenario also assumes that in the first half of the year the economy will post a growth rate near the average of the past few months, with a recovery process that will become more visible towards year’s end. Growth in final domestic demand – without inventories – is revised downward from the December projection. This, because of a slower than expected recovery of both private consumption and investment, particularly the imported components. With this, total domestic demand growth drops to 2.5 percent annually. In the case of private consumption, there is also a reduction in durable goods consumption due to the peso depreciation and slower growth in real wages associated to the upward revision to the inflation forecast. As for investment, there is the downward correction of the survey from the Capital Goods Corporation on investment plans for 2015. Thus, measured in real terms, gross fixed capital formation should be 23.7 percent of GDP this year. In this projection, gross national savings rises to 21.5 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting an increase in private saving in the past few quarters. This greater national saving has driven a further reduction in the current account. Accordingly, we estimate that this year it will be near 0 percent of GDP (table 1). On the external front, this projection assumes that our trading partners will grow more in the two-year period 2015–2016 than in previous years. The terms of trade should improve, helped by the drop in oil prices, whose impact will partly outdo the downward adjustment of the copper price. The baseline scenario assumes that copper will trade at an average of 280 dollar cents per pound in 2015–2016. In the same period, Brent oil should average 62 dollars per barrel and WTI oil, 55 dollars per barrel (table 2). Another element contributing to domestic output and demand resuming greater growth is that monetary policy continues to add significant boost to the economy, helping to keep medium- and long-term interest rates at or near record lows (figure 8). Likewise, we foresee that fiscal policy will contribute to expenditure growth significantly during this year, especially through increased public investment. As usual, our projections rely on a number of assumptions, and an important one is that consumer and business expectations will recover. Recent data show a slight revision upward of these indicators, which are still clearly pessimistic nonetheless. Meanwhile, information gathered in the Business Perceptions Report a quarterly publication by the Bank, points to moderate performance in businesses in 2015, with investment plans primarily focused on capital replenishment. Turning to inflation, in the baseline scenario the CPI will stay above 4 percent annually for some more months, approaching 3 percent over the course of 2016. For the CPIEFE, our preferred measure of core inflation, our forecast for 2015 is revised up and is expected to approach 3 percent in 2016 and stay in the neighborhood until the end of the projection horizon (figure 9). This trajectory assumes that the pass-through from the peso depreciation of recent months to prices will stand in the upper part of historic patterns; that real wages will be adjusted in line with productivity; and that capacity gaps will persist over the projection horizon. For the real exchange rate, the forecast uses as a methodological assumption that it will remain similar to its current value, considering that it is within the range believed to be consistent with the state of the business cycle and its long-term fundamentals. About the monetary policy rate, at the statistical cutoff of this Report market expectations showed differences in 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the expected path for 2015. The surveys indicated that the MPR would remain in 3 percent throughout this year, to rise during 2016. Meanwhile, the prices of financial assets suggested that it should be raised during the second half of 2015. As a working assumption, the MPR is assumed to follow a trajectory that is somewhat above what is implicit in the surveys (figure 10). As is usual in our projections, the baseline scenario reflects those events estimated to be the most likely to occur with the information at hand at the close of this Report. There are risks, however that, if materialized, may reshape the macroeconomic scenario and, therefore, may alter the course of monetary policy. Abroad, there are several elements that might trigger new episodes of volatility in world financial markets, with significant effects on credit costs, currency parities and the short-term inflation outlook. On one hand, important surprises regarding the timing and the speed with which the Federal Reserve will raise the benchmark rate may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, pushing interest rates up and further appreciating the dollar. In such a scenario, one cannot rule out that, additionally, we observe an abrupt portfolio rebalancing, given the low level of long-term interest rates and the high stock prices in the United States. Although the latest statement by the Federal Reserve has attenuated the possibility of drastic changes, the risk is still present. On the other hand, there is the situation some emerging markets are enduring, where the macroeconomic scenario could be further complicated if their commodities continue to trade at low prices. This risk is most important for Latin America, as it compounds with complex economic and political factors. Furthermore, in several countries in the region, fiscal and current-account deficits persist, making the necessary adjustments more difficult and costly. This is not the case of Chile, where the policy framework has allowed for a timely macroeconomic adjustment in the last year and a half. And let’s not forget the geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and parts of Europe, with which we have sadly lived for quite some time. In Europe, there is the Greek situation and the quirks that have characterized the agreements to finance the debt. On the positive side of risks, it could also happen that the recovery is stronger in the Eurozone, which could mean a stronger boost to the world economy and Chile. In addition, it is possible that the effects of the drop in the oil price is larger than projected and also that this price remains low for longer. Finally, there is still the risk associated to lower growth in China and its consequences on the price of copper. The state of the Chinese financial system and real estate sector continue to draw the most attention. At home, the main risk has to do with the evolution of inflation, mainly because of the unrelenting exchange rate depreciation and its accumulated effects on costs. This, in a context of margins that seem to have narrowed because of the high annual growth in nominal wages and the limited pass-through of lower fuel prices in some sectors. Therefore, the materialization of an external risk scenario that triggers a significant additional depreciation of the peso may have substantial effects on the short-term inflation outlook, which will depend on the state of the business cycle. On the other hand, it is also possible that, despite a recent improvement in domestic expenditure and output compared with previous quarters, private expectations will not improve sufficiently to stimulate further spending, especially in investment. Conversely, a scenario where expectations recover more strongly than expected would allow for more dynamic economic activity. The same can happen if the increase in national income has greater effects on expenditure in a context of more comfortable external accounts. After evaluating these risks, we estimate that, although local risks have moderated, the risk balance is still downward biased for output, while the risk balance for inflation is unbiased. Let me share with you some final thoughts now. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Final thoughts Lately, the Chilean economy has responded to the big changes in the local and external environment, by making a major adjustment. Domestic spending went from an annual average growth of about 8 percent in 2011 and 2012, to 3.7 percent in 2013 and a decline of 0.6 percent in 2014, with significant contractions in the last year in spending in imported goods, especially those for durable consumption and investment in machinery and equipment. This helped the current account deficit, which in mid-2013 was thought to be around 5 percent of GDP to drop to 1.2 percent of GDP the past year and is projected to nearly attain equilibrium by 2015. Beyond the discussion about what shock triggered the adjustment, it is clear that the process has been sound, as evidenced, for example, by the behavior of the labor market, with an unemployment rate that for all this time has never exceeded 6.5 percent. I have no doubt that our country’s economic policy framework has played a fundamental role on this. A strong, well regulated banking system has permitted credit to continue to flow dynamically to those activities where it is needed. Our fiscal policy based on a rule that determines public expenditure seeing past the cyclical ups and downs, has allowed for a significant spending program to be carried out without jeopardizing public finances. From the Central Bank we have contributed by smoothing the cycle, aggressively and opportunely reducing the monetary policy rate by 200 basis points, thus helping to drive medium- and long-term interest rates to or near record lows. Last but not least, our free floating exchange rate system has permitted the exchange rate to depreciate nearly 11 percent in real terms with respect to its trough of 2013, helping adjust the current account and favoring the competitiveness of our export sector. The saying goes that what is obvious is not talked about, and what is not talked about is forgotten. So I have thought relevant, especially in this environment that at times becomes overwhelmingly pessimistic, to stress how well equipped our economy is to deal with adverse situations. I think that the comparison with other economies of the continent, which have also suffered the brunt of the fall in the prices of our commodities, is revealing: most of them have high current account deficits and several show fiscal situations that are worrying to say the least. In many of them, high levels of dollarization or currency mismatches in the financial sector, restrict the room for exchange rate adjustment and force authorities to use less efficient instruments to achieve their goals. Chile’s reality is different: our economy’s adjustment occurred sooner than in other countries and it did so rapidly and deeply. This situation allows us to look into this and the coming years with some peace of mind. In this context, and as we projected in December, output growth has tended to stabilize around 2.5 percent annually, which is low, but in line with our baseline scenario should increase gradually through the year. True, our baseline scenario contemplates, among other assumptions, that such dynamism will be accompanied by improved agents’ expectations. As we have said before, this is a sensitive point that requires us all to cooperate. We must also bear in mind that the terrible natural disaster that just hit the north of our country will have some effect on the output figures that will be released in the coming months, which at this moment we can only guess and which will be able to assess only as time goes by. Moreover, as we well know, every adjustment process has its costs. In our case, the main associated cost has been higher inflation. In recent months inflation has exceeded forecasts and we estimate that it will remain above 4 percent for a longer time, strongly influenced by the depreciation of the peso, which has been greater and more persistent than previously thought. Thus, although we understand that higher inflation is part of the adjustment process I have described above, I want to be clear that its current levels have exceeded our estimates, and that inflation being above the upper limit of the tolerance range for several months in a row is a situation that does not leave us satisfied. This is why I hereby reiterate the unwavering commitment of the Central Bank Board to safeguard price stability, a commitment that involves introducing any changes to monetary 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  policy that we deem necessary for inflation to converge to the target level within the projection horizon. In the baseline scenario, we foresee that the exchange rate will stabilize so its effects on prices will decrease, allowing inflation to slowly converge to its target level. Other factors contributing to inflation’s convergence will be further widening capacity gaps, as the economy will continue to grow below potential still for some time, and the price effects of indexation and the Tax Reform will tend to lose significance. Additionally, a global environment of reduced inflation and its incidence on the dollar price of imported goods will also contribute to a slower growth of prices. As a working assumption, our projections assume that to guarantee inflation’s convergence, MPR will be slightly above what surveys imply. Accordingly, in the most likely scenario there should be no additional cuts. So, toward year’s end we should be debating what is the best time to begin normalizing the monetary impulse. Of course, if the present inflationary trends end up being deeper and more persistent than expected, this debate could be anticipated. The opposite should happen if such trends prove milder than foreseen. I would like to finish recalling that these years have brought major changes in the world economy. On one hand, in the aftermath of the 2008–2009 crisis the main central banks of the world had to adopt unconventional policies to cheer up their ailing economies, flooding the world with unprecedented levels of liquidity and thus increasing the price of financial assets. Today, the start of the US monetary policy normalization is around the corner, which will intensify the divergence with other developed economies whose cycles are behind. Meanwhile, after years of seemingly endless increases in commodity prices, we have seen the so-called super cycle of commodities wear out, and with it, the boom of investment and income that we experienced for the better part of the past decade. These two situations pose major challenges to emerging economies and Chile in particular. In the short term, it is very likely that we will see increased financial volatility, including unusual fluctuations in the exchange rate. This may complicate the inflation outlook, at least in the short term, as inflation is closely linked to fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate over short periods. The effects of these situations of increased volatility on the inflation trajectory at longer terms, which certainly are more important for monetary policy, are difficult to predict, as they depend on many factors, such as the cyclical state of the economy and expectations, which we carefully assess when making our decisions. Certainly these are not the only challenges that these transitions face us with. We will need a flexible economy that allows to redirect resources rapidly and efficiently from those sectors that are losing appeal to those that are gaining it; a financial system able to weigh the risks and help new ventures thrive; and we must double our efforts to improve our productivity, and so on. The good news is, as I just mentioned, we have an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework to confront changes in the external environment and an economy that, having made significant adjustments, is now free of significant imbalances. This is why I believe that, never forgetting that we are a small and very open economy and therefore ever exposed to external shocks, we can look into the future with confidence. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Fritz Zurbrügg: Comments on financial market developments Introductory remarks by Mr Fritz Zurbrügg, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the media news conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 18 June 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found on the Swiss National Bank’s website. I will begin with a review of the situation on the financial markets. I will then talk about the implementation of negative interest and its impact on the Swiss money and capital markets. Situation on financial markets Since the beginning of the year, monetary policy has continued to be an important pacesetter on the financial markets. This applies first and foremost to Switzerland, where events, especially on the foreign exchange and interest rate markets, were shaped by the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate and the lowering of the negative interest rate on 15 January. The Swiss stock market experienced a price correction, but losses were rapidly recouped. At present, the SMI is at roughly the same level as the start of the year. Thus Swiss shares benefited from a generally favourable mood among investors. Since the beginning of 2015, all the major share indices have recorded gains – albeit to varying degrees. On international bond markets, exceptional price movements have been recorded over the past few months, as shown in chart 1. Until mid-April, the government bonds of a number of countries with high credit ratings traded at historically low, or even – in some cases – negative yields. With both this development and the introduction of negative interest, yields on Confederation bonds declined over the entire spectrum of maturities. However, since mid-April, the government bond markets have suffered substantial losses, with yields on ten-year German government bonds, for instance, rising within a very short period from about 0.1% to, most recently, 0.8%. In Switzerland the increase in interest rates was significantly smaller. Yields on ten-year bonds are currently around 0.1%, compared with –0.2% in mid-April. Since the beginning of the year, numerous central banks have adopted more expansionary monetary policy stances. They include, in particular, the European Central Bank, which in January announced an asset purchase programme in excess of market expectations as regards both the amount and duration. In the US, by contrast, monetary policy continues to point in the opposite direction. Thus, most market participants expect that the US Federal Reserve will initiate a reversal in interest rates before the end of the year. For over a year, this monetary policy divergence has been a major factor behind the depreciation of the euro against the US dollar. As chart 2 shows, since mid-2014, the European currency has declined some 18% in value and has also weakened on a trade-weighted basis, by around 9%. The trade-weighted US dollar, by contrast, has gained approximately 15% in this period. Another important issue on financial markets has been the increased uncertainty due to the unresolved debt problem in Greece. Despite the fact that risk attitudes, as such, are positive, demand for safe investments and thus for the Swiss franc has remained particularly strong. Consequently, recent movements in the Swiss franc have been influenced not only by the divergence between the dollar and euro regions, but also by persistent safe haven flows. The discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate led to a very substantial but short-lived appreciation in the Swiss franc. The extent of this appreciation is shown in chart 3. The extreme movements in the exchange rate were accompanied by a sharp increase in volatility on the Swiss franc foreign exchange market. Since then, Swiss franc volatility has declined, although it remains high in a long-term comparison with the period prior to the financial crisis. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  At the same time, bid-ask spreads, i.e. differences between the best purchasing and selling offers, widened substantially following the end of the minimum exchange rate. These, too, have declined in the past few months, although the bid-ask spreads remain relatively large. In trade-weighted terms, the Swiss franc is no longer at the extreme levels that prevailed immediately after the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate. However, it is still some 12% above the level at the beginning of the year. Thus, the Swiss franc is still substantially overvalued. Implementation and impact of negative interest Exactly six months ago, on 18 December 2014, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decided to impose negative interest on sight deposit account balances at the SNB for the first time, setting the rate at –0.25%. When it discontinued the minimum exchange rate, it lowered the rate once again by 0.5 percentage points, to –0.75%. By imposing negative interest on sight deposits, the SNB intends to move the three-month Libor into negative territory and significantly reduce interest rates in the money and capital markets. The lower interest rate makes it much less attractive to hold Swiss francs compared to other currencies. This should lead to a weakening in the Swiss franc over time. How the negative interest rate is applied I would like to take a moment to remind you how our negative interest rate is applied. It is imposed on all sight deposit account balances of banks and other financial market participants held at the SNB exceeding a given exemption threshold. For domestic banks, the exemption threshold is 20 times the statutory minimum reserve requirement. For non-banks and foreign-domiciled banks (which are not subject to the minimum reserve requirement), a fixed exemption threshold of at least CHF 10 million has been set. The cumulative exemption thresholds come to about CHF 300 billion. This means that, with current sight deposits amounting to some CHF 455 billion, approximately CHF 155 billion are subject to negative interest. To date, the interest due on this amount has totalled around CHF 100 million per month. The exemption thresholds take account of the very high level of liquidity in the banking system, which is due to the SNB’s past interventions on the foreign exchange market. The exemptions are calculated to ensure that they remain virtually unchanged over time. This means that the interest burden increases as soon as the SNB feeds more liquidity into the system – in particular in the event of further foreign exchange interventions. Consequently, the SNB’s readiness to remain active in the foreign exchange market and the negative interest rate are two mutually reinforcing measures. By imposing negative interest on sight deposits that exceed a given exemption threshold, we set incentives for the entire financial system to give preference to investments in foreign currencies over those in Swiss francs, thereby limiting new inflows into the Swiss currency. Since the exceptional demand for Swiss francs is not only foreign but also domestic, there is no economic argument for differentiating by origin of investor. What is more, we have reduced to a minimum the number of exceptions from the obligation to pay negative interest. Impact of negative interest Six months after the announcement of negative interest, we can see that the measure is having the desired effect on the money and capital markets. The money market is working well, even with negative interest. Money market interest rates have reacted rapidly, and the three-month Libor has settled in the middle of the range we targeted. This shows that marginal costs – the costs of an additional unit of Swiss franc liquidity – are relevant for transmission on the interbank market. Although trading activity on the money market remains lower than before the financial crisis, it has revived somewhat. For instance, turnover on the 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  secured money market, in particular on the Swiss franc repo market, has risen since the introduction of negative interest. As intended, negative interest has been transmitted from the money market to the capital market. The lower interest rates for all maturities have widened the traditional interest rate differential against other countries again somewhat. Previously, they had narrowed substantially. On the money and capital markets, the interest rate differential is now greater than it was without negative interest, in particular for short-term interest rates. Chart 4 shows the path of interest rates for three-month loans on the Swiss franc and euro money markets, together with the differential. The greater interest rate differential helps to ensure that Swiss franc investments are less attractive than investments in euros and other currencies. Moreover, the rise in the interest rate differential has increased the cost of hedging foreign currency positions on the forward exchange market, which is an additional factor dampening Swiss franc demand. Although the interest rate differential has risen, it is still considerably below the long-term average, particularly since interest rates abroad decreased more substantially during the financial crisis than those in Switzerland. This can be seen in chart 5, which shows the example of interest rate differentials between Germany and Switzerland for three-month, two-year, five-year and ten-year maturities. While interest rates on the money and capital markets declined as a result of negative interest, mortgage rates did not decrease to the same extent. Indeed, for mortgages with longer terms, rates are slightly higher than they were at the beginning of the year. The main reason for this divergence is that a major part of bank refinancing costs consists of interest paid on savings deposits, which has not fallen below zero as did interest rates on the money market. Because interest on savings deposits is significantly higher than the money market interest rate, bank interest margins came under pressure after they had hedged the interest rate risk associated with their mortgage business, and some mortgage rates were increased. Fears that negative interest might contribute to a significant decline in mortgage rates and, in turn, to stronger growth in mortgage lending have so far proved unfounded. For investors, by contrast, the current low interest rate environment means that the challenges have increased. It is even more difficult for them to find yield-bearing investments. I should emphasise, however, that this investment predicament is an international phenomenon and not limited to the Swiss franc alone. Conclusion I will now come to my concluding remarks. Initial experience has shown that the interest rate instrument is also effective in negative territory. As intended, negative interest on sight deposits at the SNB was rapidly transmitted to all segments of the money and capital markets. In the current situation, negative interest fulfils a very important monetary policy purpose: to help correct the overvaluation of the Swiss franc over time. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Javier Guzmán Calafell: The normalization of monetary policy in the United States – challenges for emerging market economies Remarks by Mr Javier Guzmán Calafell, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mexico, during the panel on “Central banks’ policies: the new normal in monetary policy, the USD and implications for emerging market”, at the 21st Reserve Management Serminar, organized by UBS AG, Ermatingen, Switzerland, 16 June 2015. *      *      * The views expressed in this document are strictly personal and do not necessarily coincide with those of Banco de México’s Board. I am very honored to have the opportunity to participate in this Conference. I thank the organizers for the invitation to share with this distinguished group my views on some of the challenges that emerging market economies (EMEs) will be facing as monetary policy in the United States is normalized. EMEs displayed a remarkable performance in the years that preceded the global financial crisis. During 2000–2007, real GDP growth for the group as a whole was more than double that observed in the advanced economies, while also showing a significant acceleration with respect to the 1990s.1 Furthermore, emerging economies recovered quickly from the adverse impact of the crisis, with growth peaking in 2010 at a pace, again, more than twice as much as that in the advanced economies. Ever since, however, the pace of economic activity in EMEs has been continually declining, with growth in 2015 expected to mark the fifth consecutive year of deceleration. This has been the result of a number of factors, chief among them lower rates of actual and potential growth in the advanced world; the continued slowdown in China, as the economy transitions towards a more sustainable growth path and the sources of demand rebalance; the end of the commodity price boom, and particularly the sharp fall in oil prices, that has adversely affected the terms of trade of many of these economies; and the emergence of internal and external vulnerabilities, as well as supply side constraints, in a number of countries of the group. With the expectation of an increase in interest rates in the United States as monetary policy in this country normalizes, external conditions for emerging economies are unlikely to make a turn for the better in the foreseeable future. In fact, we are already witnessing a tightening of global financial conditions, and net private capital inflows for the group as a whole are expected to fall in 2015 to the lowest level since 2009.2 While this is the result of a combination of factors, including the situation in Greece and problems of a geopolitical nature, the prospect of an upward trend of interest rates in the United States seems to be playing a major role. In this context, the date of the first increase in the federal funds rate has become one of the main issues of concern for both market participants and emerging market economies’ authorities. The process of monetary policy normalization in the United States is surrounded by a significant amount of uncertainty. The Federal Reserve has made clear that adjustments to the federal funds rate will depend on the evolution of the economy, and particularly on further improvement on the labor market and reasonable prospects that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. However, as a result of a combination of                                                 1 The annual average rate for EMEs in the period was 6.5 percent, compared with 2.7 percent in the advanced economies, and 3.7 percent in emerging economies during 1990–1999. 2 Institute of International Finance (2015): “Capital Flows to Emerging Markets”, May 28. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  factors, assessment of both the underlying strength of the labor market and of inflationary pressures is particularly difficult under current circumstances. Furthermore, the impact of normalization on emerging market economies is also uncertain, as is the possible timing of such impact, especially since markets are likely to anticipate such a move. Federal Reserve officials have insisted that rather than the date of the first increase, the focus should be on the subsequent pace of interest rate adjustments, which is expected to be gradual. Nevertheless, thus far this has been of little help to calm market and emerging countries’ anxieties. The above concerns are understandable when put against the recent experience. First, as advanced economies engaged in a process of monetary policy easing and international interest rates dropped to historical minima in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, a surge in foreign capital inflows to EMEs was observed. Three features of these flows are particularly relevant:3 a) they represented a major redirection of capital flows towards EMEs, which implied that the latter received close to half of global flows between 2010 and 2013, quite far from what fundamentals in those economies could explain; b) contrary to the experience of the preceding period, portfolio flows gained an increasingly important share; and c) in an environment of strong appetite for risk, EMEs issuance of below investment-grade debt jumped swiftly. Furthermore, as a side effect, such inflows gave rise to a significant appreciation of real exchange rates and a rapid expansion of credit, including through the shadow banking system, in many EMEs, thus increasing their vulnerability. Second, the “taper tantrum” episode of 2013 provides further evidence on the significance that spillovers from shifts in monetary policy in the advanced economies, even when they are only perceived and do not actually occur, can have on emerging markets. Expectations of an unwinding of the unconventional monetary policy implemented in the United States led to a strong market reaction during that period. Consequently, financial volatility rose sharply and capital flows to EMEs fell, leading to pressures on the exchange rates and asset prices in these economies, increased external risk premia, and in general a severe tightening of financial conditions. Some authors have stressed the significance of financial market turmoil during May-August 2013, despite the relatively small decrease in capital flows to EMEs (about 1% of GDP).4 It is of course natural to ask to what extent the above experiences are applicable to the current situation. In other words, is the normalization of monetary policy in the US likely to have a major impact on EMEs? Here we have divergent views. On the one hand, there are those who believe that the outlook for emerging market economies is not as gloomy as it seems: • The upcoming tightening cycle will most likely take place within the context of a firmly established recovery in the United States, which is a scenario that has seen emerging market economies thrive in the past. As a reference, some estimates point out that, over the year following the beginning of the last three tightening cycles in the United States, industrial production in emerging markets grew between 7.5% and 10%, while export volumes did so by some 10% to 15%.5 All in all, the argument                                                 3 See Sahay, R. et al.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  goes, higher interest rates in the United States associated to a stronger economy in that country are a net positive for emerging market economies. • The ongoing efforts from the part of the Federal Reserve and other central banks in the advanced economies in terms of their communication with the public and the transparency of their decisions, are expected to play a key role on how markets react and emerging economies are affected as monetary policy in those economies goes back to normal. As evidence in support of this argument, it is noted that anticipated interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve have been followed by minor pullbacks in capital inflows to emerging markets, while the impact of unanticipated moves has been much larger.6 • After years —and perhaps decades in some cases— of continued policy efforts in some key areas, emerging economies in general are today more resilient than they were in the past to external shocks. On the other hand, there are also compelling arguments calling for extra caution going forward, as international financial markets adjust to monetary policy normalization in the United States: • Unconventional monetary policies affect financial markets in a way that differs from the more conventional interest rate policy, and the extent of such difference is largely unknown. For instance, the large-scale asset purchase programs deployed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in advanced economies have affected global interest rates along the yield curve through a significant compressing effect on bond risk and term premia, something that does not necessarily follow from changes in short-term interest rates.7 Thus, there is a risk that such premia, and particularly the term premium, quickly decompress, giving rise to an abrupt adjustment of long-term interest rates as the Federal Reserve begins to tighten. • The marked divergence in the expected path for the federal funds rate between that implied by market instruments (such as federal funds futures or overnight indexed swaps) and that obtained from FOMC projections and forecasters surveys, increases the possibility of surprises and sharp adjustments in financial markets. • The share of the nonbanking sector in the intermediation of international credit has risen substantially after the crisis, with the growing role of the asset management industry being particularly noteworthy. It has been noted that this kind of investors may be more prone to herd behavior, and therefore EMEs may be facing an increased risk of contagion during episodes of financial turbulence.8 It is of course impossible to determine ex ante which of these views is correct. As far as I’m concerned, the conclusion is obvious. In the face of an uncertain scenario with very high potential costs, it is far better for policymakers to err on the side of caution. Therefore, a close look at the factors that in the past have contributed to alleviate the difficulties resulting from similar episodes is clearly warranted.                                                 6 See International Monetary Fund (2011): “International Capital Flows: Reliable or Fickle?”, Chapter 4 of World Economic Outlook, April. 7 See Dudley, William C. (2015): “The global implications of diverging monetary policy settings in advanced economies”, speech at the Sixth High Level Conference on the International Monetary System: Monetary Policy Challenges in a Changing World, Zurich, Switzerland, 12 May. 8 See for instance IMF, Global Financial Stability Report, October 2014. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Several elements stand out in this respect.9 First, at the onset of an external shock of this nature, markets respond rather indiscriminately towards emerging market economies as a group, with differentiation following after a relatively short time span. Secondly, differentiation is made on the basis of the strength of economic fundamentals. In particular, economies with stronger external and fiscal accounts, lower inflation, more international reserves, and sound and deep financial sectors, to name a few, normally experience more subdued market reactions. This also underlines the importance of building policy buffers during favorable times. Third, markets reward timely and credible policy action, as economies that respond to emerging challenges in a flexible way and with appropriate instruments generally fare better. Fourth, even though using the foreign exchange rate as a shock absorber has proved effective in helping emerging economies to better endure a tightening of global financial conditions, intervention in this market may be useful to cope with temporary bouts of volatility in a situation of adequate international reserves and an exchange rate which is not overvalued; however, the effectiveness of intervention tends to disappear when the degree of market uncertainty reaches very high levels. Finally, growth potential is another major element of differentiation during episodes of turbulence; more specifically, the better the prospects for growth the less severe the likely consequences of financial turmoil. Undoubtedly, putting in practice the above lessons will determine to a great extent the success of emerging market economies in coping with the possible turbulence that lies ahead. However, I would like to emphasize that advanced economies are not exempt from responsibility in this respect. Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly noted that promoting growth and stability in the United States is the most important contribution the Federal Reserve can make to the global economy, and that this is precisely the focus of monetary policy in this country.10 They have also stressed the need for effective communication to limit the risk of surprises and the possibility of abrupt market responses. I have no quarrel with these arguments, and I believe there is widespread recognition of the major efforts undertaken by the Fed to increase transparency and communication in recent years. However, I see room for further action from advanced economies in at least three areas. First, unconventional monetary policies, though fundamental to overcome the global financial crisis and underpin the recovery of demand in recent years, provide only a temporary stimulus to economic activity. Ensuring adequate and sustained rates of growth implies the adoption of measures focused on enhancing efficiency and productivity that go well beyond the reach of monetary policy. Indeed, there is a lot that advanced economies still need to do to meet these needs. Second, actions taken by major central banks have important consequences for other economies which deserve careful consideration. Yet, an adequate understanding of such spillovers is still lacking. Although literature on the subject is scant and definitive conclusions are difficult to arrive at, to have an idea of the challenges we are facing, it may be useful to note that recent research carried out at the BIS concludes that US quantitative easing has                                                 9 See, among others, Sahay, R. et al.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  had a greater impact on emerging market economies than on the US economy itself.11 Greater awareness among advanced economies of the consequences of their monetary policy actions would be a major step forward for a more productive dialogue with EMEs. Third, the room for expanding international cooperation is wide. The strengthening of the global safety net is a key area in this respect. The creation of a permanent and broad network of bilateral central bank swap facilities; the conclusion of the still pending IMF reform and the deepening of efforts in this direction, to provide the institution with proper resources and more legitimacy in its decision making; and greater collaboration between multilateral organizations and regional financial arrangements, should clearly be part of these endeavors. While some of these tasks need the involvement of both emerging and advanced economies, the crucial role of the latter is evident. I would like to conclude my intervention by stressing that, beyond the challenges resulting from the beginning of the cycle of interest rate increases in the United States, emerging market economies will face a less favorable external environment in coming years. On the one hand, potential growth in the main advanced economies and China has declined and the prospects are not very encouraging either. As a result, emerging economies as a group will probably be facing a weaker demand for their exports, and thus further pressures on their external and fiscal balances. Furthermore, and related to this, the projected evolution of commodity prices in the medium and long term implies a deterioration of the terms of trade for an important subset of these economies, vis-à-vis the levels that existed before the global financial crisis. Lastly, in the face of a gradual but very prolonged increase in interest rates in the United States, conditions of access to external financing will tighten. It is clear, then, that the deterioration of external conditions should not be seen as a short term phenomena, and that EMEs should strengthen their domestic sources of economic growth. This implies ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability, the timely tackling of any potential sources of vulnerability, both internal and external, and the implementation of any structural reforms required to encourage investment and productivity growth.                                                 11 See Chen Q. et al.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Structural reforms and long-run growth in the euro area Intervention by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, on panel “Long-run growth, monetary policy and financing of the economy” at the 43rd Economics Conference of the Central Bank of the Republic of Austria, Vienna, 15 June 2015. *      *      * Summary As the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy is playing its part in the euro area recovery, structural reforms are the domain where there is more still to do to create the conditions for sustainable long-run growth, which is critical to the integrity of our monetary union. There is however no “one size fits all” model for how countries should go about tackling structural challenges. While there are principles that apply across countries, each economy is different and reforms have to be tailored to national conditions. As a central bank, our interest is not in how countries implement reforms, but whether they succeed in doing so. There are two main channels through which structural reforms can support long-run growth in the euro area, namely through increasing the adjustment capacity of the economy and through raising its potential growth rate. Put differently, reforms can raise both the trend of long-run growth and reduce the fluctuations around that trend. Both aspects are particularly important in a monetary union, which makes structural reforms commensurately more pressing. The environment for introducing structural reforms is better today than for several years: all the conditions are in place for governments in the euro area, individually and collectively, to begin addressing their long-term challenges. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to participate in this panel on “long-run growth, monetary policy and financing of the economy”. For some this may seem like an unusual combination of topics, as it is often argued that monetary policy has no long-run effects. Monetary policy can however affect long-run growth in several ways. First, by increasing certainty over the future price level it can support investment and efficient resource allocation. Second, by reducing fluctuations in the business cycle it can help forestall hysteresis effects. Third, if one takes a “leaning against the wind” view of monetary policy, it can play a role in tempering the financial cycle and misallocation of resources that often comes with it.  But monetary policy is already playing its part in the euro area, so I do not want to dwell on this topic today. I will focus instead on an area where there is more still to do to create the conditions for sustainable long-run growth – that is, structural reforms in the euro area. The main point I would like to make is as follows. For many euro area countries structural reforms are central to higher long-run growth. And that each economy achieves this is in turn critical to an efficient implementation of monetary policy and, over time, to the integrity of monetary union. But there is no “one size fits all” model for how countries should go about tackling structural challenges. While there are principles that apply across countries, each economy is different and reforms have to be tailored to national conditions. As a central banker, my interest is therefore not in how countries go about strengthening their economies. This is for governments individually and collectively to decide who know their national challenges best. My interest is in whether they succeed in doing so, due to the impact this has on price stability and on the cohesion of the union as a whole. In the remainder of my remarks I will elaborate on these points, focusing on the two main channels through which structural reforms can support long-run growth in the euro area. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Increasing adjustment capacity The first is through increasing the adjustment capacity of the economy. This means two things: first, that output is less affected by shocks because relative prices adjust quickly; and second, that the recovery in output is faster because the economy is able to reallocate resources in a more efficient way. Adjustment capacity is important in itself, but it also supports long-term growth insofar as it reduces the depth of recessions and the duration of unemployment, lessening labour and capital hysteresis. When countries do not have an independent monetary policy and exchange rate, as in the euro area, the ability to adjust to shocks in this way becomes commensurately more important. To avoid large increases in unemployment it is crucial that national institutions can facilitate a smooth adjustment process. In other words, the need for a higher degree of “resilience” comes automatically with membership of a monetary union.  While this is first and foremost a national responsibility, it is also of common interest in a monetary union. If some members consistently rebound more slowly from shocks than others, it complicates the achievement of price stability at the euro area level. The risk also increases that differences in structural unemployment become entrenched across the Union. And insofar as this weakens the political rationale for monetary union – that all members are better off over time inside the Union than they would be outside – it also weakens its long-term cohesion. That has negative spillovers for all member economies. It is in this context that several of my colleagues on the ECB Executive Board have recently called for stronger common governance at the European level over economic policies.1 The ability of all countries to adjust well to shocks is not only key for the delivery of our mandate, it is vital for the integrity of the currency. This is an area of legitimate interest for the central bank which is the guardian of that currency.  However, it is important to stress that the ECB’s interest in structural reforms should not be misinterpreted as a call for centralisation along a “one size fits all” model. We do not need all euro area countries to adopt identical structural reforms. What we need is a framework that takes into account both how countries differ based on their national conditions, and how they are similar by virtue of being in a monetary union. Within those parameters there are various combinations of country-specific institutions that can produce smooth adjustment.  Let me illustrate what I mean by focusing on one example: labour markets. Theory suggests that, in a monetary union, there are certain principles that should apply to labour markets across countries. For instance, without the option of exchange rate devaluation, maintaining wages in line with productivity over time is thought to be central to sustaining competitiveness and avoiding painful internal devaluations. Ensuring that wages can respond to changes in labour demand or supply is also seen as a key element in limiting the employment cost of shocks. If firms have the scope to cut costs on the intensive margin – i.e. wages, bonuses and working time – they are less likely to cut costs through the extensive margin, that is, labour shedding.  Wage-productivity links have indeed proven to be an important factor in countries’ external positions. France, for example, has experienced large losses in export market shares since the start of monetary union in 1999, and part of the reason for this is that labour market institutions have allowed wages and productivity to de-link across firms. Micro-level data show that wages have grown almost as much in the least productive French firms over the last decade as they have in the most productive. By contrast, in Germany there is clear wage dispersion according to firm productivity.                                                  1 For instance, see Draghi, Mario (2015). “Structural reforms, inflation, and monetary policy.” Introductory speech at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, 22 May 2015. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Moreover, while the strength of the crisis shock has inevitably led to high job destruction, the employment cost does appear to have been influenced by the margins of adjustment available to firms. On the whole those that had scope to adjust on the intensive margin have cut jobs less. For example, new micro level research from the Eurosystem finds that firms with flexibility at the plant-level have reduced employment less during the crisis than those bound by centralised wage bargaining agreements, partly because they have been more able to adjust wages and working time to economic conditions.2  Labour market policies that reflect such principles may therefore be beneficial in most euro area countries. But it does not follow from this that there is an optimal model for the labour market that all must emulate. Economies are complex, and how labour markets function depends on manifold interactions at the national level. Designing structural reforms thus requires a nuanced and country-specific approach.  For example, how the labour market adjusts to shocks depends not only wage formation, but on the overall constellation of labour market institutions within national economies. That is, how the adjustment margins interact with other features such as unemployment insurance, employment protection and active labour market policies – the latter being particularly important in the current context of a “cleansing” recession requiring substantial reallocation and retraining of workers. And we know from international experience that different combinations of labour market institutions can produce similar employment outcomes.  If one compares, for example, the largest euro area economy, Germany, with the US and Denmark, we can see that they have different levels of public expenditure on labour market protection (0.1% in the US, 0.7% in Germany and 2.1% in Denmark), different levels of union density (US 11%, DE 19%, DK 69%) and a different percentage of employees covered by wage bargaining agreements (US 13%, DE 62%, DK 80%). Unemployment rates in all three countries have nonetheless been on a downward trend since 2009.  Moreover, how labour market institutions affect adjustment also depends critically on interactions with other policy areas. In Greece, for example, it took around two years for lower labour costs to translate into lower prices, largely because product markets were highly protected and did not react. Due to structural factors the responsiveness of the economy to price changes has also been relatively low: Greece ranks below most other small economies in terms of both share of foreign trade to GDP and elasticity of exports to price competitiveness. Policy objectives like raising competitiveness therefore have to take broad set of national conditions into account: competition in product markets, the quality of judicial systems and public administration, the ease of doing business, to name but a few. There are of course other factors that are relevant as well, in particular the role of demand policies. But the key point is about diversity. It is not enough to give one-dimensional prescriptions such as that the all labour markets must become more flexible. What matters is that the combination of policies and institutions within each country produces an outcome that is satisfactory for its citizens and sustainable for the euro area as a whole. Underscoring this message is important, otherwise it can wrongly seem as though monetary union deprives citizens of democratic choice. One could get the idea that which political orientation a country opts for is unimportant, as it will have to implement to same structural reforms anyway. There are some minimum requirements that come with being part of a monetary union. But there are various ways of meeting them. This is perhaps a notion that, in the future, we could do a better job of conveying.                                                 2 di Mauro, F., and Ronchi, M.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Reinforcing supply capacity Alongside adjustment capacity, structural reforms contribute to long-run growth through a second channel: by increasing the supply capacity of the economy, or its potential growth rate. Well-designed structural policies not only increase the quantity of inputs to the production process – i.e. higher labour supply and capital growth – but they can also foster the more efficient use of those inputs across and within sectors, that is, higher total factor productivity (TFP).  The supply capacity channel is also especially important in a monetary union. In the absence of large-scale fiscal transfers and with limited labour mobility across countries, all member economies need to be able to sustain high levels of growth and employment for the Union to be cohesive over the long-term.  Potential growth is however weak in many euro area countries. This is in part because the crisis has lowered both capital growth, through a steep fall in investment, and labour supply, through higher structural unemployment. But it also reflects weak long-term trends in productivity. For example, between 2000-14 TFP increased cumulatively by only 1.5% in the euro area, while in the US it rose by 10.9% in the same period. This not a situation over which we can be complacent, not least given the substantial damage that still remains from the crisis. Structural reforms can play an important role, in different ways, in addressing the challenges related to each production factor. Labour supply in the euro area will inevitably be affected by the impact of ageing societies. Yet with high structural unemployment there is clear scope to increase quantities, especially through labour market policies targeted at reactivating the long-term unemployed. In Portugal, for example, ECB internal estimates find that active labour market policies can explain about one-third of the improvement in employment since the trough. The 2012 Spanish labour market reform is also estimated to have a saved the destruction of about 60,000 jobs in the short term, and had a medium-term impact of some 300,000 fewer jobs destroyed.3 These are admittedly relatively small gains relative to the scale of the challenge, but they provide an indication that determined actions in this area can produce results. Though the investment-to-GDP ratio in the euro area is currently still 3.5 pp below its pre-crisis level, capital growth is projected to bounce back as the economy strengthens and accelerator effects take hold. However, there are two key risk factors to this outlook, both of which structural reforms can help mitigate. The first is that pessimism among firms about future growth prospects continues to weaken the business case for higher investment. 5 years ahead growth expectations among forecasters have been falling continuously since 2001, from around 2.7% then to 1.4% today, which may have filtered through into “animal spirits”. In this context, structural reforms that raise expectations over the path of potential growth can have an important psychological impact, insofar as they reduce uncertainty and dislodge negative sentiment. The second risk factor is that the persistence of a debt overhang in parts of the euro area continues to act as a major drag on firm and household spending. Here structural reforms can be supportive both through their positive effect on GDP – the denominator effect – and through facilitating nominal debt reductions – the numerator effect. In the latter case, this comes down to issues such as improving the efficiency of insolvency regimes, out-of-court restructuring frameworks and judicial systems.4                                                  3 BBVA (2013).

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  However, we know that it is not just raising the quantity of investment that matters for long-term growth; the quality of investments, and how they contribute to TFP growth, is just as significant. Indeed, it is telling that since 2000 total investment has been slightly higher as a percentage of GDP in the euro area than in the US, while producing a much inferior TFP performance. Two factors can help explain this discrepancy: first, the relatively higher share that US firms have invested ICT capital, and second, the efficiency with which they have turned that investment into productivity gains. And it is structural factors which, at least in part, account for these two differences. First, while there is variance within the euro area, on the whole there is a relatively higher proportion of micro and small firms in Europe than in the US. European firms are also more static, in the sense that they do not grow or shrink over time. For example, the average size of a manufacturing sector start-up in the US and Italy is roughly the same within its first two years – 5–10 employees. After ten years, however, the average US firm has grown to around 75 employees, while the average Italian still has below 15 employees.5  This matters because the size and growth rate of firms tends to have strong impact on ICT diffusion. Small firms are generally characterised by a relatively lower accumulation of ICT capital due to the higher fixed costs they face.6 They also tend towards higher risk aversion and encounter greater difficulties in collecting resources to finance more innovative projects.7 An economy populated by small firms that do not grow is therefore likely to be one with lower investment in ICT, and therefore lower TFP growth. The reasons why euro area firms grow more slowly are complex, but structural policies certainly play a role. In Italy, for example, regulations that kick-in at the 15 employees threshold appear to have encouraged firms to stay small (although these are de facto now no longer in force).8 A similar phenomenon has been observed in France, where size-contingent regulations appear to cause firms to cluster below 50 employees.9  Wider product and labour market regulations may also affect firm growth by hindering firm entry and exit and hence discouraging reallocation. For example, differences in product market protection are associated with differences in ICT adoption and diffusion in the service sector.10 Recent evidence suggests that the quality of institutions can also affect reallocation: enhancing the efficiency of civil justice can lead to higher rates of firms' market entry and attract foreign direct investment.11 In this sense, the incentives for within-firm innovation may be closely linked to the capacity for between-firm reallocation.12                                                  5 Criscuolo et al. “The dynamics of employment growth: new evidence from 18 countries.” CEP Discussion Papers, No. 1274, June 2014. 6 Pellegrino, B., and Zingales, L. “Diagnosing the Italian disease.” Unpublished manuscript, September 2014. 7 Amatori, F., Bugamelli M. and A.

   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  However – and this brings me to second point – even in euro area countries that have kept pace with the US in terms of ICT capital, firms have been less able to exploit the productivity potential of their investments. For example, between 2001-07 the average annual contribution of ICT capital to GDP growth was identical in the US and Belgium (0.38 pp), yet TFP contributed 0.53 pp more to GDP growth in the US. Structural and institutional factors can in part explain these differences too. One key element is differences in the quality of human capital. The impact of ICT on productivity is crucially mediated by the quality of management and its ability to implement the necessary organisational changes required by new technologies. While the US ranks highly in terms of management quality, with some such as Germany close behind, most euro area countries are estimated to have average or below-average management practices.13 This clearly weighs on productivity growth. Indeed, one study finds that management practices account for about one quarter of cross-country and within country TFP variations.14  Addressing this human capital gap above all requires structural policies linked to education and training. But it also has a broader dimension linked to ownership structures and meritocracy. For instance, rigid family ownership structures have been found to be associated with lower management quality, as they limit the talent pool from which firms can draw.15 Such structures also tend to reinforce firm smallness.16  In sum, structural reforms that address the nexus between firm size, organisation and ICT are central to raising TFP growth in the euro area. But let me stress that what I am talking about is not an agenda to promote digital technology firms or build “Silicon Valleys”, as important as that might be. What is most crucial for TFP growth is the diffusion of new technology into the ICT-using sector – namely services – where the euro area lags most behind the US. As the largest part of the euro area economy, exploiting ICT in this sector is critical for the euro area to significantly boost its aggregate productivity.  Raising productivity is not a challenge that we can take lightly. It is not only central for a cohesive monetary union based on real economic convergence. It is also a necessary condition of supporting ageing societies. As the European Commission’s new Ageing Report shows, the economic age dependency ratio – the ratio between the inactive elderly (65+) and total employment – is projected expected to rise from 44.6% in 2013 towards 66.4% in 2060.17 Only with higher productivity growth can so few sustainably support so many. Conclusion Let me conclude. What I have argued today is that structural reforms can raise long-run growth in two ways: by raising the trend of long-term growth, and by reducing the fluctuations around that trend. Both these aspects are particularly important for economies in a monetary union. This makes structural reforms commensurately more pressing.                                                 13 Bloom, N., Sadun, R., and J.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  This is not to say that all the euro area’s problems are structural. Demand policies remain crucial to close a still-large output gap and to secure a strong cyclical recovery. And it is possible that some issues that are currently considered to be structural, such a high long-term unemployment, could reverse in a stronger demand environment. That is to say, if hysteresis operates in the downswing, it may also reverse in the upswing. Yet according to all estimates potential growth in the euro area is weak, and has been on a declining trend for at least 15 years. A strong and sustained recovery cannot therefore come from demand policies alone. It has to entail reforms that improve the allocative efficiency of the economy and unlock its supply capacity. The environment for introducing structural reforms is better today than for several years. Monetary policy is extremely accommodative. Activity is recovering. And credit supply constraints are falling, allowing finance to flow quickly to the new investment opportunities that reforms create. All the conditions are therefore in place for governments in the euro area, individually and collectively, to begin addressing their long-run challenges.   [1]   [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  [9] [10].

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Manuel Sánchez: Productivity, growth, and the law Remarks by Mr Manuel Sánchez, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mexico, at the Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics, organized jointly by the World Bank and the Bank of Mexico, Mexico City, 16 June 2015. *      *      * It is an honor to have the opportunity to deliver the closing remarks at this international conference, organized jointly by the World Bank and the Bank of Mexico, on the relationship between productivity, growth, and the law. On behalf of the Bank of Mexico, I would like to extend my gratitude to all the participants for their valuable contributions. The discussions here have been highly enlightening, and the wide variety of papers presented has helped us deepen our understanding of the vital role of productivity in any economy. Identification of the sources and effects of productivity is critical to explaining why income levels differ so much among nations, and more importantly, may give us a guide as to how to foster higher living standards. I would like to begin my remarks by reflecting on a few salient issues in the literature on productivity and the rule of law. Then, I will briefly explore some struggles that policy makers face in the aim of promoting efficiency and economic expansion. Finally, I would like to address challenges to higher long-term economic growth in Mexico. As usual, my remarks are entirely my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Bank of Mexico or its Governing Board. A few salient productivity issues Two basic observations arise from international data on economic development. The first is the persistent divergence of income per capita across countries over a sufficiently long period of time. This well-known tendency is striking, as developing economies typically exhibit unexploited business opportunities that would otherwise allow them to grow faster than industrial nations, thereby catching up with the leaders. We know that, as a general trend, absolute convergence has not occurred. A second observation is that a large part of economic growth can be attributed to the efficiency with which production inputs are applied, in addition to the intensity of their use. Economists refer to the first as total factor productivity (TFP), estimated on the basis of measures of output and inputs, as well as certain production function assumptions. The success of a few countries which have managed to multiply their income levels quite rapidly has largely resulted from booming TFP. Furthermore, productivity differences at the firm level within an industry is a puzzle that prevails even in advanced countries. Firm survival is frequently linked to higher levels of efficiency. These observations make the study of productivity a central object of inquiry. On the other hand, the fact that TFP is estimated as a residual implies that it summarizes our ignorance regarding what makes one economy or firm more efficient than others. At the aggregate level, research on the possible sources of productivity and economic growth has been extensive. In particular, empirical studies during the last few years have largely focused on the search for a dominant driver of economic progress, through the test of competing hypotheses. A central premise examined has been the role played by political and legal institutions.1                                                 1 The pioneer work of Douglass North sets the basis for the discussion on the role of institutions in economic development. See North, D.C. (1981), Structure and Change in Economic History. New York: W.W. Norton; 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Institutions can be interpreted as a set of permanent rules that limit the behavior of individuals and the government, providing a stable framework of certainty. The rule of law represents a central piece of the group, encompassing factors such as the protection of property rights and the administration of justice. The explanatory power of institutions has been placed empirically against factors such as geography, international trade, and human capital.2 Results from ongoing investigation have not been conclusive. Although most research in economics evolves through ideas that may later be refuted, in this case, the prolonged lack of conclusiveness seems to reflect two difficulties. The first has to do with technical issues associated with measurement problems and the choice of instruments to correct for the possible endogenous nature of the proposed determinants. For instance, significant debate has centered on what might be an adequate institutions indicator, given the fact that the concept is vague, and some of the variables commonly used come from opinion surveys that do not necessarily reflect the permanent rules of the game. Similarly, instruments have been criticized for not exhibiting exclusive correlation with the variables being tested. Yet, in spite of the complications, these technical problems should eventually be settled.3 A second, perhaps deeper reason as to why empirical confirmation of the prominent role of institutions has remained contested is the fact that the search for a single key driver could be misplaced. It is likely that, given the complexity of the process of economic development, several factors might come into play, in changeable mixes, and some of them may not fit the notion of an institution. For example, the interaction among different realms of economic policy that conform a favorable business environment has gained ground in empirical research as a possible set of leading engines of growth. The stellar economic performance of China and South Korea during the last few decades provides some support to the idea that good policies may precede preeminence for strong institutions.4 Additionally, research done with micro data sheds light on the role of internal elements at the firm level, such as managerial ability and practices, as well as the impact of industry structure on productivity. For example, the reallocation of resources toward more productive firms within an industry can be described as a result of competition and different skill distributions among heterogeneous firms.5 In short, the literature and the ample scope of papers presented in this seminar bear witness to the need for multifaceted explanations of productivity.                                                                                                                                                    and North, D.C.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Policy struggles for promoting productivity Given that productivity expansion is crucial for economic growth, its promotion constitutes a natural target for policy making. Countries vary in terms of geography, cultural heritage, and other conditions that may affect economic efficiency differently. At the same time, in any nation, room for enhancing productivity growth can almost always be claimed. The pursuit of this objective faces significant challenges. While some are common to other policy decisions, the difficulties encountered here may be greater due to the following four reasons, at the least. First, there is no silver bullet for resolving the problem of productivity. The economic literature referred to and the discussions held in this conference make it clear that a number of elements may interact. Second, there is no well-defined list of factors that could ensure high productivity growth in all cases. For example, economists know that reliable institutions, fully operating markets, and competition may provide incentives for investment, human capital accumulation, and productivity growth. However, many other policy decisions may also contribute to the same end, and their combination may vary. There is no recipe, let us say, based on some composite indicator, with which policy makers should try to maximize results. The best policy mix and the need for concrete institutions may depend on history and the initial conditions of specific countries. Third, even if we had a clear-cut list of elements for productivity expansion, the relative importance of their components would hardly be undisputed. The consequence of this is that there is no roadmap that is obviously superior to alternative paths for economic reform. Fourth, though a trajectory did exist that would dictate a preferable sequence of measures, democratic societies require some of these changes to be legislated. International experience demonstrates that political feasibility does not necessarily coincide with economic desirability. These four difficulties illustrate the fact that our understanding of productivity and our capacity to prescribe changes are necessarily limited, pointing towards the need for caution. Perhaps in no other area, given its breadth, should economic advisers and policy makers exert a greater deal of judgment while, at the same time remaining humble. In any case, policy makers are expected to use all the information on hand, including the best estimates of theoretical models, to foment a favorable setting for productivity. Sometimes, this may simply mean incrementally removing obstacles, thereby allowing private participants to strengthen the existing institutions that facilitate economic activity.6 Additionally, implementation of measures to fuel efficiency must not be considered in isolation. The absence or presence of other policies or institutions that could be necessary should be taken into account. A leading example is that of privatization, in which the lack of an appropriate regulatory framework or governance rules in some countries has produced unintended consequences, including the stripping of privatized company assets.7 Finally, it goes without saying that expectations for the potential of economic measures ought to remain realistic. Reasonable expectations are required for social support to continue for the never-ending process of economic modernization.                                                 6 Easterly, W.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Mexico’s productivity challenges In the last few decades, Mexico’s economic performance has been far from impressive. Examination of the data reveals that the main problem has not been either employment or investment, but productivity. In particular, during the thirty-five years beginning in 1980, GDP per capita grew at an annual average rate of 0.9 percent. Growth accounting reveals that both labor and investment contributed, respectively, 1.1 and 0.6 percent to this moderate expansion, with higher contribution from labor largely reflecting a diminishing dependency ratio during these years. TFP contracted, on average, 0.7 percent per year.8 To gain some insight into Mexico’s productivity problem, it is useful to examine sectorial productivity performance. Due to a lack of reliable data on capital by sector, we need to focus on labor productivity. For this exercise, I divide GDP in four sectors: agriculture, the manufacturing industry, the nonmanufacturing industry, and services. For the period under consideration, on average, total labor productivity dropped 0.3 percent per year, with rises in the first two segments of the economy and falls in the latter two. Without an attempt to provide a formal explanation of the contrasting sectorial development, the following conjectures are relatively safe.9 The fastest-growing sector in terms of productivity was agriculture, with an average annual rate of 1.2 percent, mainly reflecting a sharp reduction of the labor force dedicated to this activity. Average productivity growth in manufacturing was 0.2 percent per year, surprisingly low given the undeniable efficiency levels of some subsectors such as automobiles and electronics exposed to competition in international markets. Nonmanufacturing exhibited the sharpest contraction in productivity, at negative 1.7 percent. This dismal result is driven mainly by utilities in the hands of state monopolies, and construction, of which a large fraction is self-construction suffering from low scale and lagging technology. Labor productivity in services also declined, at 1.1 percent, explained, to some extent, by absorption of low-skilled labor from rural areas and widespread levels of informality in some branches of economic activity. Finally, during the last two years, Mexico has undertaken a program of structural reforms of various areas of the economy. The aim is to tackle some of the evident problems of low efficiency briefly described, by allowing or increasing competition as well as facilitating investment and market operations. Results from these measures depend on the depth of their actual implementation and, in any case, should be viewed as steps along a road that needs to be paved with further changes. Concluding remarks Productivity is a central subject for researchers and policy makers, as it bears on the core issues of the potential for sustained economic improvement.

Many factors impinge on a country’s productivity dynamics, making it necessary for any explanation to consider the issue in a multifaceted way. The pursuit of higher productivity growth is challenging. Policy makers should avoid looking for a nonexistent panacea, while at the same time recognizing the need for continuous progress. In Mexico, the bar is also high. Productivity performance has been underwhelming, but a recent program of structural change could yield benefits along the path to greater modernization, if essential building blocks such as the rule of law are reinforced and the reforms are implemented adequately and deeply. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Takehiro Sato: Recent economic and financial developments and monetary policy Speech by Mr Takehiro Sato, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Kofu, Yamanashi Prefecture, 10 June 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. Introduction Thank you for giving me this opportunity to exchange views with people representing the political, economic, and financial arena of Yamanashi Prefecture. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japan’s Kofu Branch. In today’s speech, I will begin by focusing on economic and financial developments in Japan and abroad, as well as the Bank’s recent monetary policy. I will then touch briefly on the economy of Yamanashi Prefecture. Following my speech, I would like to hear your views on actual conditions in the local economy and on the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy. I. Recent economic and financial developments in Japan and abroad A. Developments in the world economy The world economy has been sluggish, despite the decline in energy prices (Chart 1). In the January–March quarter of 2015 in particular, it exhibited signs of a slowdown, as the growth rate of the U.S. economy turned negative due to the effects of the severe winter weather and the labor disputes at West Coast ports, and as the growth rate of the Chinese economy remained at around 7 percent. These developments in the world economy affected Japan’s economy to some degree as well. The decline in energy prices since 2014 was initially expected to have positive effects on the world economy, but negative effects seem to have preceded them – such as the decline in income in commodity-exporting countries and the decrease in investment in resource development – due to the rapid pace of the energy price declines. As for the outlook, the world economy is expected to see a moderate increase in its growth rate, with the recent improvement in soft data reflected in hard data, as positive effects of the decline in energy prices – such as an increase in real income in the energy-consuming countries – permeate gradually. As for the U.S. economy, a substantial deceleration in growth in the January–March quarter has been observed three times in the past five years. The deceleration occurred for different reasons each time, but there seems to be a seasonal pattern of some kind. Besides the severe winter weather and the labor disputes at West Coast ports, the appreciation of the dollar also casts a shadow on manufacturers’ sentiment, thereby affecting indicators of business fixed investment. The effects of the decline in energy prices on investment in resource development are also evident (Chart 2). In contrast, reflecting the improvement in the employment situation and the decline in gasoline prices, consumer sentiment has generally stayed at a high level. It is a matter of concern that, despite the favorable sentiment, private consumption remains lackluster and growth in the April–June quarter of 2015 has been sluggish so far. However, the economy is expected to gradually return to a recovery path led by private consumption on the back of a moderate increase in wages as the employment situation continues to improve – following more or less the same pattern of the past five years. The inflation rate has been stable due to the decline in energy prices, but the slack in the labor market seems to be diminishing to a certain degree, reflecting the 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  decline in the unemployment rate, although there are such problems as the increases in the number of long-term unemployed workers and part-time workers. In this situation, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has been communicating to the public a path toward raising the policy interest rate, but is taking a flexible and cautious stance that the exact timing will depend on future economic indicators. In Europe, manufacturers’ sentiment has been picking up in reflection of the decline in energy prices and the depreciation of the euro, and consumer sentiment has also started to recover (Chart 3). With the improvement in soft data, the pick-up in hard data has become evident, as seen, for example, in positive GDP growth for eight consecutive quarters. The inflation rate, which temporarily had been negative, has recovered to around 0 percent. That being said, given that the effects of the debt problem remain, the risk of prolongation of low inflation leading to a postponement of investment and consumption has receded but seems to still exist, and I have been monitoring these developments closely. Meanwhile, unconventional monetary policy measures introduced by the European Central Bank (ECB) initially had significant effects on the foreign exchange and bond markets; however, these markets have recently shown large fluctuations. Many points are being made regarding the sustainability of such large-scale asset purchases, and I will pay attention to any progress made regarding this matter. With regard to the Chinese economy, the GDP growth rate for the January–March quarter of 2015 decelerated to 7.0 percent. Looking at recent developments in electricity consumption and railway freight turnover, my impression is that actual economic growth could be slower than suggested by the GDP figures, although we should not make a decisive judgment as these developments may reflect the effects of the shift toward a service economy and the progress in structural reforms that are promoted by the Chinese government (Chart 4). Moreover, manufacturers’ sentiment has been dampened further. Movements toward inventory adjustments in Japan – in materials and related goods such as iron and steel – seem to be partly affected by the slowdown in the Chinese economy. As for the outlook of the Chinese economy, the growth rate is likely to remain downward-biased, owing to a sharp change in the demographic situation and the resultant fall in the potential growth rate. However, given the typical pattern observed over the past few years – in which, once the economy is projected to deviate downward from the growth target, the government implements small-scale economic packages, thereby achieving the pick-up in the economy – the same developments generally seem to be taking place this year as well. Meanwhile, attention should be paid to the point that downward pressure on inflation has been increasing, as evidenced by the year-on-year rate of change in the GDP deflator for the January–March quarter of 2015 turning negative for the first time since 2009. B. Developments in global financial markets Taking into account the developments in the world economy that I have illustrated, let me turn to developments in global financial markets for the time being. The first key point is how a hike in the policy rate in the United States affects global financial markets. In light of the recent U.S. economic indicators, the timing of a hike in the target federal funds rate that market participants expect is either moving forward or backward. On the other hand, the Fed is working to let the markets factor in a rate hike in the near future while cautiously avoiding providing decisive information. Judging from pricing in the federal funds futures market, this intention by the Fed has generally permeated the markets, and the difference in views between Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants and the markets – which was seen some time ago – is starting to be resolved (Chart 5). Of course, if market participants begin to identify the specific timing of a rate hike, global financial markets might show a different reaction from the past. This concern seems to have materialized in the market reaction when Fed Chair Janet Yellen mentioned the valuation in the stock and bond markets in early May 2015. Meanwhile, as a result of a number of financial regulations, major market makers’ risk-taking activities have been restricted, inducing concern regarding a decline in 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  liquidity even in the U.S. Treasury markets. Given these circumstances, I would like to monitor carefully whether, when the timing of a rate hike becomes clearer in the future, a change in the international flow of funds will not cause any significant repricing or unexpected knock-on effects in various asset markets. The second key point in terms of developments in global financial markets is the effects of large-scale asset purchases by the ECB (Chart 6). When these purchases were first implemented, it was considered that the effects of the purchases had already been factored in. However, even after the implementation, long-term interest rates in European countries fell markedly; for example, 10-year German bund yields declined to around 0 percent temporarily. At the same time, the euro depreciated further. Since late April, however – probably because of a reaction to the sharp drop in interest rates – long-term interest rates in Germany have risen above the level seen before the implementation of the ECB’s asset purchases, and thus have exhibited rather volatile movements. This increase in volatility appears to be related to a decline in market liquidity, resulting from the scale of the ECB’s purchases being massive relative to the size of sovereign bond markets. Also, in Japan, a rise in volatility in long-term interest rates was observed both after the introduction of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in April 2013 and following the expansion of QQE at end-October 2014. Specifically, contrary to the initial intention, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) temporarily jumped up somewhat significantly immediately after the implementation of QQE. In contrast, they declined further after the expansion of QQE and have recently returned to around the level seen before such expansion. These fluctuations in long-term interest rates appear to be attributable not only to monetary policy but also to external factors, and therefore should be assessed carefully. That being said, if the effects of monetary policy are produced by the declines in nominal or real interest rates, due attention should be paid to the possibility that liquidity premiums in the JGB markets – brought about by the Bank’s massive JGB purchases – might in part be weakening the effects of monetary policy. There is also a possibility that the fluctuations in long-term interest rates reflect the move to factor in improvement in the outlook for economic activity and prices. The third key point is also related to European factors – namely, developments in political and economic conditions in Greece. As the Greek government faces severe financing needs, negotiations regarding financial assistance to the country continue. At this point, possible effects on peripheral European countries are limited. However, I would like to monitor future developments whether or not any unexpected knock-on effects emerge in global financial markets. C. Developments in Japan’s economy Looking at developments in Japan’s economy for the January–March quarter of 2015, not only business fixed investment but also exports and production maintained their moderate improving trend. Private consumption and imports were resilient and final demand remained firm. For the April–June quarter, the economy is expected to continue recovering moderately because, for example, it seems that private consumption has been resilient since March, although production is projected to be more or less unchanged, mainly due to inventory adjustments in some industries (Chart 7). Expectations for somewhat higher growth in the world economy will also serve as a tailwind for Japan’s economy. The virtuous cycle from income to consumption and investment will likely operate, with its certainty gradually increasing, on the back of the firm employment situation and favorable corporate results. However, we should probably be mindful of the risk that the increase in households’ real purchasing power and the improvement in corporate profits, both brought about by lower crude oil prices, will not lead to an expansion of spending by as much as expected, and consequently pressure for excess savings – or for an increase in current account surplus – will not be alleviated easily. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  With regard to the employment and income situation, which forms the basis for the virtuous cycle that I just mentioned, wages continue to rise moderately in a situation where labor market conditions have become increasingly tight, even after the year-on-year growth in total cash earnings was revised downward due to the replacement of samples in the Monthly Labour Survey (Chart 8). Wages are expected to continue increasing moderately, reflecting a base pay increase that is likely to take place for a second consecutive year. Thus, private consumption is expected to reach a moderately higher level as the effects of a decline in real income due to the consumption tax hike in April 2014 dissipate gradually. From a somewhat longer-term perspective, I focus on the pace of increase in firms’ productivity, which is the basis for a sustainable rise in wages, as well as on the impact of the aging population. In order for consumption to maintain its uptrend in the medium term, it would be necessary to have a sustainable recovery in real wages of about 60 million workers that could offset developments in real income of about 40 million pensioners. The pace of recovery in private consumption will likely remain very moderate from a somewhat longer-term perspective, even considering that wages will gradually see a higher rate of increase in accordance with a rise in productivity brought about by an increase in business fixed investment, and that confidence in the sustainability of the social security system will increase because of the implementation of related reforms. Regarding private business fixed investment, such investment on a GDP basis has been slow to increase so far despite a pick-up in monthly indicators, such as shipments and the aggregate supply of capital goods, and the firmness in investment plans suggested by the results of the Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan). However, fixed investment overseas has been marking consecutive double-digit increases recently, suggesting that firms’ appetite for fixed investment on a consolidated basis has been robust for some time (Chart 9). What matters is not whether firms will increase fixed investment further, but whether they will make investments in Japan. In this regard, domestic fixed investment so far has been made by nonmanufacturers in particular, but some manufacturers are finally beginning to increase production capacity in Japan, reflecting the yen’s depreciation the past two years, although automobile firms’ shifting of production facilities to overseas, which has been made in a full-fledged manner since around 2014, remains in some part. From a somewhat longer-term perspective, whether a change in firms’ production network strategies will become widespread, in turn leading to increasingly building up production capacity in Japan rather than overseas, depends on their medium- to long-term projections for exchange rates. Specifically, if firms judge the yen’s depreciation the past two years to be a sustainable trend, they would proceed with increasing their production capacity in Japan. On the other hand, firms that have concern regarding a possible resurgent appreciation of the yen would not easily change their production network strategies even with the recent depreciation of the yen. In this regard, the Annual Survey of Corporate Behavior, conducted by the Cabinet Office, provided a favorable factor: the yen-U.S. dollar rate for the next year forecasted by firms was 119.5 yen/dollar, marking a weaker yen forecast for the third consecutive year (Chart 10). However, it should be noted that, when firms decide their fixed investment, long-term projections for the next five to ten years are important. Therefore, it is uncertain whether a trend of increasing production capacity in Japan will become widespread in the future. D. Developments in prices Let me now turn to developments in prices. The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food has been about 0 percent recently, reflecting the decline in energy prices. It is likely to be at this level for the time being, due to the remaining effects of the decline in energy prices (Chart 11). This suggests that consumer prices also lack momentum at present. However, a decline in general prices due to the decrease in energy prices exerts upward pressure on real income, and therefore I consider 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  this to be a favorable factor for Japan’s economy. What matters is not the fluctuations in monthly figures of the year-on-year rates of change in the CPI, but the underlying trend in inflation, which reflects the overall economic conditions. In my view, the underlying trend in inflation is firmly maintained. In a situation where the inflation rate rose mainly due to the depreciation of the yen and the increase in energy prices in the past two years, various soft data suggested a negative reaction by households to a rise in the inflation rate in light of sluggish growth in real wages. In fact, private consumption, which was also affected by the consumption tax hike, had been sluggish (Chart 12). This should prove that people consider it desirable to see the inflation rate rising in balance with wages and income as economic conditions improve, rather than seeing the inflation rate simply rising. I believe that the price stability target intrinsically aims for such desirable developments. A matter of concern is whether the deceleration in the rate of increase in the CPI or the decline in the CPI on a year-on-year basis, which have been observed recently, will not affect people’s medium- to long-term inflation expectations in a backward-looking manner. In this regard, judging from firms’ price-setting behavior, consumers’ spending activity, and the recent developments in wage negotiations, people’s perception of inflation has been changing steadily despite the decline in energy prices. Moreover, a wide range of estimates – such as those of expected inflation derived from nominal interest rates1 and those of trend inflation using a regime-switching model2 – suggest that medium- to long-term inflation expectations in Japan appear to be rising since the introduction of QQE from a somewhat longer-term perspective (Chart 13). However, under the deflation that lasted for over 15 years, medium- to long-term inflation expectations appear to consistently remain lower than those in the United States. The challenge is to re-anchor these expectations at around 2 percent, comparable to the level in the United States. What I consider important as factors that determine people’s medium- to long-term inflation expectations are not just the past developments in the inflation rate that I mentioned earlier, but also developments in the overall economy and in asset prices, as well as forward-looking expectation formation based on, for example, wage revisions. Taking this point into account, I hold the optimistic view that it is less likely that people’s medium- to long-term inflation expectations will be negatively affected by a decline in the inflation rate due to the fall in energy prices. I would note that the recent results of academic research on the methods for measuring inflation rates offer valuable suggestions for the old but also new issue of how to define consumer prices. For example, the SRI-Hitotsubashi Unit Value Price Index, which has been developed by Professor Naohito Abe of Hitotsubashi University, incorporates prices of new goods that firms frequently introduce into markets in calculating price indexes3 According to the research by Professor Abe, 46–47 percent of goods do not exist in the same week of the previous year at the average retailers, indicating that replacement rates of goods are very high in reality (Chart 14). The same research also finds that some new goods are virtually unchanged from the previous ones, suggesting a possibility that firms replace goods frequently as a means of adjusting prices in effect. In calculating a change in prices of goods                                                 1  See Kei Imakubo and Jouchi Nakajima, “Estimating Inflation Risk Premia from Nominal and Real Yield Curves Using a Shadow-Rate Model,” Bank of Japan Working Paper Series No. 15-E-1, April 2015. 2  See Sohei Kaihatsu and Jouchi Nakajima, “Has Trend Inflation Shifted? An Empirical Analysis with a Regime-Switching Model,” Bank of Japan Working Paper Series No. 15-E-3, May 2015. 3  For details, see Naohito Abe, “Saikin no Kakaku Shisuu no Doukou to Shin Shohin no Eikyo ni tsuite (Recent Developments in Price Indexes and Effects of New Goods),” Newsletter No. 3, the Research Center for Economic and Social Risks (RCESR), Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University, March 2015 (available in Japanese), and Naohito Abe et al., “Effects of New Goods and Product Turnover on Price Indexes,” RCESR Discussion Paper Series No. DP15–2, March 2015. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  over a particular period, general consumer price indexes only cover the goods for which price information is available at the beginning and the end of the period; on the other hand, the SRI-Hitotsubashi Unit Value Price Index quantifies the importance of the introduction of new goods that I have just mentioned. The research concludes that, mainly due to the effects of such introduction on prices, the year-on-year rate of increase in the SRI-Hitotsubashi Unit Value Price Index for supermarkets has recently been at about 1 to 1.5 percent, which shows a higher rate of inflation than in CPI statistics released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) and in a price index that only covers continuing goods (Chart 15). These research results do not allow simple comparison with the CPI statistics released by the MIC, in part because the coverage of the SRI-Hitotsubashi Unit Value Price Index is limited to goods with point-of-sale (POS) data. However, I take the view that they provide useful insights to firms’ price-setting behavior through the introduction of new goods and its effects on developments in prices, and to a divergence between the inflation rate perceived by households and that measured by price statistics. II. Future conduct of monetary policy A. The price stability target and conduct of monetary policy In what follows, I explain issues regarding monetary policy. About two years ago, the Bank introduced QQE to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years. The latest figure for the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is about 0 percent due to the decline in energy prices, and the baseline scenario outlined in the April 2015 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices shows that the timing of reaching the price stability target has been delayed to around the first half of fiscal 2016 (Chart 16). However, the Bank’s Policy Board has judged that no policy actions are necessary at this point based on the view – as I mentioned earlier – that the underlying trend in inflation is firmly maintained under the virtuous cycle of the economy. With regard to the timing of reaching the price stability target, I believe that the phrase “at the earliest possible time” represents the essence and that “a time horizon of about two years” is only a non-binding target, as the commitment to achieving a specific price level within a specific time frame, in my opinion, does not fit the conduct of monetary policy adopted by other major countries in the first place. That is, in my understanding, the price stability target is a rolling target with a time horizon of about two years, and this is broadly in line with the idea of inflation targeting adopted by major countries. From this viewpoint, the delay in the timing of reaching the price stability target would not be the essential problem. As I touched on earlier, firms and households generally have a negative reaction to mere inflation, mainly due to concern over a rise in costs and to the negative effects on real wages, both stemming from a rise in import prices. On the other hand, in continuing with QQE, I consider it necessary to take into account that this policy is a kind of shock therapy that influences formation of people’s inflation expectations through the lowering of real interest rates and risk premiums brought about by massive asset purchases, as well as through a strong commitment. The Bank has provided forward guidance – namely, that it will continue with QQE, as long as it is necessary for achieving the price stability target in a stable manner – and of course, the necessity of continuing QQE will be judged in line with this guidance. I therefore do not think that the current policy framework should be reviewed in an automatic fashion simply because two years have passed since the introduction. In my understanding, the price stability target is a flexible concept with a certain range for upward and downward deviations of the actual inflation rate from the target under the framework of forecast targeting. It is also my understanding that achieving the price stability target in a stable manner does not refer to a state in which the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI simply marks 2 percent, but rather one in which people’s medium- to long-term inflation expectations are re-anchored at around 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  2 percent – in other words, a situation in which households and firms are projected to shift their consumption and investment behavior to one that assumes around 2 percent inflation. The status of achieving the price stability target and the necessity of continuing QQE will be judged by the Bank’s Policy Board at each Monetary Policy Meeting. In doing so, I would like to take into account (1) the effects of QQE after its expansion, (2) the sustainability of the Bank’s massive JGB purchases, and (3) a wide range of QQE’s side effects, all of which I will elaborate on shortly. B. Effects of QQE after its expansion The first point that needs to be examined in continuing with QQE is its policy effects (Chart 17). After the expansion of QQE at end-October 2014, the 10-year JGB yields temporarily dropped below 0.2 percent, but these recently have recovered to around the level seen prior to the expansion. Meanwhile, the market’s outlook for economic activity and prices has actually been revised downward, and therefore there is a lack of persuasive evidence of a further rise in inflation expectations. One of the assumed transmission mechanisms of QQE is to put downward pressure on nominal interest rates across the entire yield curve through massive purchases of JGBs. I understood the expansion of QQE at end-October 2014 as an action that would strengthen such a mechanism. In reality, however, it appears to me that the degree of difficulty in implementing QQE is rising, as the effect of lowering nominal interest rates has been diminishing gradually, due mainly to a rise in liquidity premiums, despite a large-scale expansion of the Bank’s JGB purchases. Let me give you some background as to why it has become difficult for long-term interest rates to decline. First, interest rate levels are already low, and it is becoming difficult to see a linear relationship between the amount of JGB purchases and interest rates. Second, there tends to be less demand for JGBs from final investors under extremely low interest rates. Third, dealers’ risk tolerance is declining, as there is an increase in volatility due to the decline in market liquidity and to the effects of overseas interest rates. I will explain these three factors in more detail. With regard to the first one, the key is whether real interest rates will decline further – in other words, whether people’s medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise further only with the Bank’s “strong and clear commitment” – in a situation where it is becoming difficult for nominal interest rates to decline. Of course, it may be theoretically possible to further push down nominal interest rates if the Bank continues its purchases of JGBs even with negative interest rates. However, in that case, the Bank would become the only buyer of JGBs, which would likely give rise to a concern over the Bank’s purchases being perceived as financing the fiscal deficit, as well as to a further decline in market functioning. Regarding the second factor, whether or not demand from final investors will decrease depends in part on their future stance on JGB purchases. For example, a reduction in life insurance companies’ promised return for some insurance products that will start from July 2015 might affect investors’ future behavior (Chart 18). As for the third factor, dealers’ risk tolerance will likely change depending on market conditions. Taking such factors into consideration, I will pay close attention not only to the effects of the progress in the Bank’s asset purchases on interest rate formation, but also to changes in investors’ and dealers’ behavior, and closely monitor how policy effects will emerge in the future. C. Sustainability of the Bank’s massive asset purchases The second point that needs to be examined in continuing with QQE is the sustainability of the Bank’s massive JGB purchases (Chart 19). The Bank currently commits to purchasing JGBs with medium- to long-term maturities so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. On a gross basis, the Bank purchases JGBs at an 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  annual pace of about 110 to 120 trillion yen, which is equivalent to about 90 percent of the total amount of JGBs’ market issuance. If final investors were to reduce their holdings of JGBs by redeeming the bonds each time they come to maturity and not reinvesting the amount redeemed in JGBs, the Bank’s massive JGB purchases would be sustainable. However, in reality, there is a certain level of demand for JGBs, mainly for those used as collateral. For example, the amount of JGB holdings by major banks, which had been reduced at the time QQE was introduced, has been stable recently, and the same applies to the amount held by regional financial institutions. In a situation where there appears to be a certain level of demand by final investors to reinvest the amount redeemed at maturity, the sustainability of the Bank’s JGB purchases may become an issue if the Bank continues its massive purchases at the current pace while final investors reduce their holdings of JGBs to the least possible extent. This limit is dependent on the interest rate level and other factors at each point in time, and thus is difficult to project at this point. Nevertheless, in continuing with QQE, it is important to give consideration to its feasibility in terms of the Bank’s market operations. D. Examination of side effects The third point that needs to be examined in continuing with QQE is the side effects of the Bank’s massive asset purchases. It is true that policy effects and side effects are two sides of the same coin, and positive effects cannot be expected from policies that have no side effects. Having said that, in continuing with the unprecedented policy, it is essential to compare its positive effects and side effects and examine whether the latter do not outweigh the marginal effects from continuing the policy. With regard to how the increase in the share of the Bank’s holdings in the JGB market affects market functioning, I am somewhat concerned about the results of the Bond Market Survey conducted by the Bank in February 2015, as recovery in market functioning is considered to be the key to a smooth exit from QQE from a somewhat longer-term perspective (Chart 20). I also continue to pay careful attention to the effects of the continued extremely low interest rates on financial institutions’ business, and to the stability of the broadly defined settlement system. E. Importance of efforts toward fiscal consolidation The Bank’s massive purchases of JGBs are carried out only in the context of the conduct of monetary policy and not in any way to finance the fiscal deficit. In order for this explanation to be persuasive, the government’s efforts toward fiscal consolidation are important. It also should be noted that the massive JGB purchases, if continued over a long period, could lead to extremely low interest rates being built into the fiscal plan, thereby affecting fiscal discipline – although the continuation of such purchases aims at fulfilling the purpose of monetary policy. Once market participants have concern about fiscal discipline, controlling long-term interest rates will become difficult, even for the Bank. My assessment is that QQE has generally been exerting its intended effects so far, but in order for QQE to gain success – such as a smooth process of finding an exit from QQE from a somewhat longer-term perspective – the government’s initiatives toward fiscal consolidation are important. The government looks to formulate a new fiscal consolidation plan by summer 2015 to maintain its goal of generating a surplus in the primary balance for fiscal 2020. The Bank strongly expects that the government will steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure with a view to ensuring the credibility of the country’s fiscal management. Concluding remarks: Economic activity in Yamanashi Prefecture My concluding remarks will touch on the economy of Yamanashi Prefecture. A feature of the industrial structure of Yamanashi Prefecture is that its share of manufacturing – industries relating to machinery in particular – is larger than that in the country overall. The prefecture’s economy has recently been recovering moderately, led by 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  manufacturing firms that are attracting external demand, both directly and indirectly (Chart 21). Nevertheless, from a somewhat longer-term perspective, there have been moves by manufacturing industries in the prefecture to concentrate their production sites in Japan or shift a part of their production overseas, for the purpose of enhancing cost competitiveness, mainly in response to the yen’s appreciation since the Lehman shock and to intensification of competition stemming from growth of Asian firms. Such moves have led to structural issues in the prefecture, such as a declining population as well as an aging population and declining birth rate. In addressing these issues, the key should be to make full use of the advantages of Yamanashi Prefecture. The first advantage is that the prefecture is close to Tokyo and yet blessed with a bounteous nature, including Mt. Fuji and hot springs. Recently, in particular, the number of foreign visitors to the prefecture has been increasing substantially, partly owing to the yen’s depreciation. It also should be noted that the prefecture is a highly attractive place to move to, for those who live in the Tokyo metropolitan area. I have heard that initiatives to take advantage of such an environment are spreading, such as improving tourism infrastructure and expanding a supporting system to invite those who wish to move to the area. Moreover, events such as the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games and the launch of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen line will act as a tailwind for Yamanashi Prefecture. The second advantage is the advanced technologies that firms in Yamanashi Prefecture have developed so far. I hope that technological innovation will advance as a result of further brushing up these technologies, applying them to new areas, and working to integrate them with other firms’ technologies. This, together with cooperative efforts among industry, government, academia, and financial institutions, is expected to lead to future achievements. I would like to conclude this speech by expressing my strong hope that the region will enjoy further growth in the future through the initiatives I have mentioned, while making use of its potential.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Alexandre A Tombini: Central banking – the next 50 years Introductory remarks by Mr Alexandre A Tombini, Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil, at a panel discussion to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Central Bank of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, 10 June 2015. *      *      * Today’s panel discussion is part of a series of events to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Banco Central do Brasil. Other events in the series have looked backward. Today we’d like to take advantage of the collective wisdom and experience of our distinguished guests to look forward: what can we expect in the next 50 years of central banking? This is an ambitious question, but an appropriate one as the art and science of central banking is currently in flux, and the outcomes of today’s policy debates and institutional innovations will shape central banking for many years to come. The global financial crisis has had a major impact on how we think about central banking. Before the crisis, there were, naturally, a number of unanswered questions and challenging issues for central banking, but the prevalent view was that the major pillars of the field were largely settled. In a growing number of countries, the operational regime for monetary policy was inflation targeting; monetary and financial stability objectives could be safely addressed separately; and floating exchange rates, coupled with robust international reserves and access to multilateral funding facilities, were often seen as sufficient to protect financial stability from excessive international capital flow volatility. Naturally, macroeconomic stability was and still is a necessary condition for the framework to operate properly. The crisis has led to a reexamination of some issues we thought were settled and to the emergence of some new questions. Even though Brazil was not at the epicenter of the crisis, we were affected by the crisis itself and by the policies that were put in place in its wake. Furthermore, we have been actively participating in the international central banking debate in order to offer our views and to learn from the experience of others. *      *      * In my opening remarks, I will focus on three topics that have provoked particularly intense debate and that I believe will shape central banking for some time to come. In each of these topics, the global financial crisis prompted a rethinking that is still underway, although some initial conclusions can already be drawn. First, maintaining financial stability was reemphasized as a core function of central banks. Central banks have always been concerned with financial stability, particularly through their lender-of-last-resort role. But in many jurisdictions, central banks progressively downgraded the importance of the financial stability goal in the post-war period. The supervision of banks was progressively split off from central banking, and a gap emerged in that, in some jurisdictions, nobody was tasked with looking at the vulnerabilities in the system as a whole. This is less true for emerging markets, including Brazil, where central banks tended to keep a strong focus on financial stability even before the global financial crisis. In part, this reflects the fact that financial crises were relatively more common in emerging markets in the late 20th century. There was also an old and important academic and monetary policy debate in the decade leading up to the crisis on whether we should lean against a financial bubble or clean up after it has burst. However, the lack of consensus on this issue resulted, in practice, in a mostly laissez-faire policy stance. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Today, I think it is safe to say that there is general agreement that proactively maintaining financial stability, by taking appropriate action against the buildup of vulnerabilities, is a proper goal for central banks. The high cost of “cleaning up” after the global financial crisis will serve as a reminder against excessive complacency for some time to come. The current debate is about the policy tools for the goal of maintaining financial stability. Macroprudential policy is widely seen as the first line of defense against systemic risk, but there is still uncertainty about its effectiveness. There is also disagreement on whether monetary policy should take financial stability considerations into account at all. On this latter issue – the use of monetary policy to deflate potential financial bubbles – there are two views. One is that monetary policy is likely to be particularly effective because it affects all financial markets. Another view, that has been stated most forcefully by Lars Svensson, is that monetary policy is an inefficient and potentially even harmful tool for financial stability, since it is too unfocused and may have counterproductive macroeconomic effects. This is far from a theoretical matter: there is currently a lively debate on whether the current low interest rates in major jurisdictions are leading to “search-for-yield” behavior in certain financial market segments, potentially threatening financial stability, and whether this provides an additional motivation for normalizing monetary policy sooner rather than later. The view that seems to be gaining strength, and to which I subscribe, is to use macroprudential policy to maintain financial stability and allow monetary policy to focus on price stability. However, the definitive answer to this question will depend on the progress in the development of macroprudential policy tools and frameworks. Despite some positive experiences, including in Brazil, macroprudential tools are still insufficiently tested and the theoretical literature is in its infancy. The degree of success in using these tools will help determine whether there is a role for monetary policy in helping to achieve the financial stability goal. A second issue that has been the subject of considerable debate is the nature of monetary policy regimes. Before the crisis, there was a strong consensus on inflation targeting (or IT) as the most adequate monetary policy regime, due to its flexibility and transparency. After the crisis began, major central banks were soon forced to lower interest rates to the effective zero lower bound. Or so we thought at the time: some central banks are now testing the bound by bringing interest rates further and further below zero. Even so, it is clear that there must be some effective lower bound on interest rates. Furthermore, negative rates, if maintained over a significant period of time, may result in financial market distortions; for example by causing lasting damage to the money market fund business model. Central banks responded to this new challenge through a variety of unconventional measures which included what is known now as quantitative easing (or QE). However, there is still no full agreement about the effectiveness and the collateral effects of these unconventional policies. (I will speak about some of its side-effects a bit later). Even before the debate about the limits of IT frameworks at a zero-lower bound, many economists, particularly in academia, proposed innovative monetary policy regimes such as price-level or even nominal GDP targeting. These regimes were seen as more powerful in the zero lower bound because they would effectively require central banks to make up for periods of below-target inflation or nominal GDP growth by keeping rates lower than required under IT after the economy recovers. Since monetary policy primarily affects the economy through long-term real interest rates, and therefore through agents’ expectations for the future paths of the policy rate and of inflation, the end result would be more accommodative policy during the downturn than recommended under the IT regime. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  A more modest proposal was to keep the IT regime, but increase the targeted level of inflation. The crisis and the bubbly period that preceded it convinced many that the modern macroeconomy is more prone to shocks that previously believed, and therefore the 2% target level that prevailed in mature economies before the crisis was perhaps too low to keep the economy from repeatedly hitting the zero lower bound. My take on this debate is that, at the end of the day, inflation targeting emerged even stronger from the crisis. No major central banks abandoned inflation targeting, and some central banks that were not inflation-targeters adopted elements of the framework. There are several reasons for the resilience of the IT regime: • Central banks found that inflation targets were actually helpful in explaining the need and the room for unconventional policy measures to the general public. • Furthermore, inflation targets helped anchor inflation expectations, keeping deflation at bay despite the large output gaps prevalent at the height of the crisis. • The proposed new monetary policy regimes suffer from a number of practical deficiencies. They are too complex for the general public to understand and follow. And nominal GDP targeting relies too heavily on an unobserved variable, potential GDP growth. • Finally, changing the regime, or even just raising the inflation target, in the middle of a crisis risked damaging the credibility that central banks have gained under the IT regime. However, if the secular stagnation hypothesis that has been revived by Larry Summers and Paul Krugman is to be believed, this debate may be far from over. The argument is that there may be a tendency for a chronic excess of savings relative to investment, for various reasons including slower population growth and a less capital-intensive economy. If so, real equilibrium interest rates will be lower than in the past and the zero-lower-bound will be a recurrently binding constraint. I am still unconvinced by this hypothesis, however. As has been pointed out by Ben Bernanke, the secular stagnation arguments tend to ignore the global nature of today’s economy. As long as there are profitable investment opportunities somewhere in the world, capital will tend to flow from economies with excessive savings to those with excessive investment demand. The resulting exchange rate depreciation would increase aggregate demand and therefore neutral interest rates in the economies with excessive savings. And indeed, there are abundant high-return, capital-intensive investment opportunities in many emerging economies including Brazil, particularly in infrastructure. However, if the hypothesis does turn out to be realistic, the zero lower bound will recur, and the shortcomings of the inflation targeting regime under those conditions may lead to a renewed search for alternatives. The third and final issue I will address today is how to deal with capital flows. Of course, the potential for destabilizing capital flows was well understood even before the crisis. In fact, after the various financial crises of the 1990’s, emerging markets began to accumulate international reserves in order to build a buffer of foreign exchange liquidity. The combination of floating exchange rates and robust foreign reserves, it was hoped, would be sufficient to protect economies and financial systems from destabilizing capital flows. The resort to unconventional monetary policies in the wake of the global financial crisis resulted in an unprecedented level of global liquidity. Emerging markets were buffeted by unusually intense and volatile capital flows. Exchange rate appreciation and FX market intervention were insufficient to maintain financial stability. The policy response in many emerging markets included macroprudential policies to 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  dampen the effects of capital inflows on domestic credit and capital markets. These policies included both measures that aimed at domestic markets and measures that directly targeted capital inflows. There is currently widespread agreement that a multipronged approach, including macroeconomic, structural, and macroprudential policies may be necessary in order to deal with capital flow surges. More recently, academia, central bank researchers and the IMF have endorsed a judicious combination of capital flow management measures with strong macroeconomic policies, including using exchange rate flexibility as the first shock absorber. However, these measures have costs, including market distortions, administrative burden, and negative market reactions. Furthermore, there are still a number of open questions. What combination of policy instruments should recipient countries use in order to minimize costs? To what extent should the burden of adjustment also be on source countries? Is it possible to improve on the decentralized outcome through international policy cooperation? I am still unconvinced that there is room for much greater international policy coordination – central banks have domestic, not global mandates. However, it seems to me that there is some scope for cooperation at least in identifying potential cross-border and financial stability risks and adopting, when necessary, targeted macroprudential policies – either in recipient or in source countries – in order to prevent capital flows from fueling unsustainable financial bubbles. *      *      * I’ve raised a number of open issues in central banking that I believe will shape central banking for some time to come: • Financial stability is once again a core function of central banks, but macroprudential policies and frameworks are still in their infancy, and a proper role of monetary policy in ensuring financial stability is still under discussion. • Inflation targeting remains the dominant monetary policy regime, but if growth skeptics are correct and the zero-lower-bound recurs, there will be renewed calls for moving to innovative regimes or at least higher inflation targets in mature economies. • A laissez-faire approach to capital flows is off the table. There is still disagreement, however, on how to deal with flows, on who bears the burden of adjustment, and on the scope for global policy cooperation. However, there is perhaps a deeper lesson to be drawn from the global financial crisis. The crisis came largely as a surprise; not because we did not see the bubbles forming, but rather because the central banking community as a whole failed to fully take into account the vulnerabilities resulting from the growth of the shadow banking sector, the opacity of the novel financial instruments that helped fuel the bubble, and the complex domestic and international linkages between different financial sector intermediaries. A fundamental lesson to be drawn from the global financial crisis is the need to develop an integrated, forward-looking approach to central banking that brings together: • Comprehensive, granular (and perhaps “real time”) financial sector surveillance that focuses on identifying systemic risk and develops adequate market infrastructure and reporting systems; • Market intelligence that captures short, medium and long-term trends in the financial system, including, for example, the potential impacts of the rapid evolution of electronic trading platforms and algorithmic investment strategies; and 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  • Research and analysis that spans monetary, exchange rate, and macroprudential policies. We have made some progress in this direction here at the Central Bank of Brazil, but we expect to continue to develop this integrated approach to central banking for some years to come. Hosting discussions like this one we are having today is part of this process, so I’m looking forward to hear from our panelists, which do not require any introduction. But nevertheless let me say a few words to introduce them to you. Our first panelist is Jacob Frenkel. Dr. Frenkel taught international economics at the University of Chicago before serving as Governor of the Bank of Israel between 1991 and 2000. He then moved to the private sector, where he is currently the Chairman of JPMorgan Chase International and he also serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the Group of Thirty. I’d also like to introduce Jean Claude Trichet. Mr. Trichet had a long and successful career in the public sector where he was assigned to various posts in the French government, including Governor of the Banque de France. In 2003 he was appointed President of the European Central Bank, in which capacity he served for eight years. He is currently the Chairman and CEO of the Group of Thirty. Our third panelist is Axel Weber. After a distinguished career in academia, Dr. Weber was president of the Deutsche Bundesbank between 2004 and 2011. After leaving the Bundesbank, he was a Visiting Professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. He is currently Chairman of the Board at UBS. I have enjoyed throughout these many years, in a variety of forums and debates their always-to-the-point sharp remarks and so I hope that we can today benefit from their thoughts, thank you for being here Jacob, Jean-Claude and Axel. Ms. Adriana Arai will moderate the discussion. Ms. Arai joined Bloomberg News in 2004, and currently is executive editor for local language content and chair of the Bloomberg São Paulo Office Committee. Previously, she worked for Dow Jones Newswires in São Paulo, Brasília and London. Adriana, the floor is yours.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Cœuré: Interview in La Croix Interview with Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in La Croix, conducted by Ms Marie Dancer and published on 10 June 2015. *      *      * 1. The economy Are we seeing a real recovery in the euro area? Yes, we are now seeing a recovery. Growth is returning in the euro area, including the countries that suffered the most during the crisis (with the exception of Greece). However, this recovery needs to be consolidated, as it is only just beginning and remains fragile. First of all, it is being driven by a number of temporary factors: cheap energy prices, combined with the low levels of both interest rates and the euro’s exchange rate, which are a result of our monetary policy. We will not be able to rely on these factors forever. The second area of fragility – of concern, even – is the weakness of investment. Until investment has clearly picked up again, we will not be able to say that the recovery is robust. The ECB has contributed to that pick-up in investment by reducing the cost of both short and long-term financing. (The average maturity of the assets that we have purchased is eight years.) However, a sustainable pick-up in investment requires the involvement of other players. It means having a business climate that encourages firms to invest and a favourable regulatory and social environment. It falls to governments and social partners to determine the rules of the game. Banks also need to lend. Lending is picking up in the euro area, but mainly for large firms. Lending to small and medium-sized enterprises is not growing strongly enough. The new banking regulations are intended to discourage speculation; they are not a reason not to finance the economy. Should we borrow at the European level in order to invest? Investment should primarily be in the private sector, so the priority, again, should be the creation of a favourable environment. The financial conditions have been achieved, but the regulatory and fiscal conditions have yet to be put in place. The question, then, is whether we need greater public investment in order to act as a catalyst. Yes, certainly – but only in countries with sufficient room for manoeuvre. Is the recovery not artificial, driven by liquidity? Prosperity should be judged on the basis of growth and the declining unemployment rate. Liquidity is merely a tool serving that objective. Unemployment has begun to fall – albeit gradually – in the euro area. But in a number of countries, including France, it is not yet declining. In this sense, you are right – the job has not yet been completed. Is France lagging behind? I am French. I have faith in my country’s ability to create growth, as we have numerous assets, such as our demographics (which are more dynamic than the European average), our ability to innovate and the strength of our exports. So I have no concerns about France’s position in the euro area and the world in the longer term. But France is out of step with neighbouring countries such as Ireland and Spain, which have carried out more reforms and done so earlier – not to mention Germany, which is benefiting from even older reforms. At the moment, those countries are reaping the benefits of their reforms in terms of growth. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Are the reforms in France sufficiently ambitious? Reforms are always more difficult in larger countries, but I am in no doubt that France is on the right track. Now that the recovery has clearly begun, we need to make it stronger and more sustainable. The ECB’s actions have created a window of opportunity for reforms. There is a risk that the pace of reforms will slow because of the electoral timetable, but now is the time to push ahead with them. What is working worst in France? It is not for the ECB to highlight good and bad points or go into detail about reforms carried out by elected governments. Much has been done to reduce the burden on firms through the Responsibility Pact and the Competitiveness and Employment Tax Credit (CICE), and efforts are being made to cut public spending. We can argue about those efforts (since the ECB would like them to be more ambitious), but efforts are being made. The area where France suffers in comparison with the rest of the euro area is the labour market. It would benefit from moving towards a labour market that is more inclusive of people who have problems finding employment. 2. Financial markets, liquidity and bubbles Is the excess liquidity that has been injected into the markets – notably by the ECB – not paving the way for a bubble and the next crisis? Are the markets not high on liquidity? The ECB has pursued its policy of monetary easing – rock-bottom interest rates and purchases of securities in the markets – in order to return to growth and inflation below, but close to, 2% in the euro area, in line with our mandate. We know that this policy has some side effects. It is true that there is a lot of liquidity in circulation. We are not currently concerned about financial bubbles in the euro area. Financial assets are not over-valued at present; I am thinking of stock markets in particular. But we remain very vigilant in this regard, particularly since rates will remain low for an extended period of time. Does this mean that the economists who are sounding the alarm are correct? Such warnings are useful. We must learn the lessons of the financial crisis, which we have scarcely emerged from, and ensure that the growth model in the euro area is different from that which led to the crisis – based on uncontrolled debt, risky (and even unlawful) behaviour by some banks and non-productive investment (e.g. investment in the Spanish and Irish property markets). To that end, we now have new instruments. The financial sector is much better regulated – thanks, first of all, to the banking union, which allows banking supervision to be independent of political pressures, strict and harmonised. The banks are also better capitalised, and we have new “macro-prudential” instruments aimed at preventing bubbles and financial instability, which we should not hesitate to use. The ECB is also involved in discussions regarding financial regulation at the global level, where we are arguing that the non-bank sector – “shadow banking” – should be supervised just as rigorously as the banks. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  You are not worried that an abrupt reversal in the markets could quickly break through all of these firewalls? Admittedly, there has been some short-term volatility in the markets [ed.: yo-yoing rates]. That is inevitable, not so much because of the monetary easing pursued by the ECB, but because of uncertainties in the global economy, which went through a soft patch in the first quarter of this year. The financial markets need to adapt to the fact that we now have very different monetary policies in the United States and the euro area and a new regulatory environment. That is causing a lot of uncertainty and will entail a period of adjustment. The ECB does not intend to counter that volatility in the short term, which would effectively give market participants a free insurance policy. However, we will not allow excessive fluctuations in financial markets to threaten the achievement of our objective, which is to ensure price stability in the medium term. The best contribution that we can make is to be clear about the future direction of monetary policy. For this reason, we have been clear about the fact that purchases of securities will continue until September 2016 at least, and longer if necessary. Does the ECB still have room for manoeuvre, or has it now used all of the tools at its disposal? The reason that rates are at zero and purchases of securities are being carried out is because we want to kick-start the European economy and raise inflation towards 2%. This is a temporary strategy aimed at responding to the very specific situation that we saw in 2014, when inflation rates deviated from our target on a lasting basis and flirted with deflation. Were we to abandon that policy today, we would plunge the euro area into an undesirable situation where both growth and inflation were weak in the long term. Some people refer to that as the “world of 1%” – i.e. 1% growth and 1% inflation. There is, of course, no question of us doing that. But monetary policy cannot do everything. In order to avoid the “secular stagnation” that certain economists fear, monetary policy must be supplemented by (i) responsible fiscal policies that use available room for manoeuvre in countries where it exists but prevent debt from exploding in countries where debt levels are high and (ii) an economic environment that allows firms to invest and create jobs and fosters employability. Does the ECB feel that it is alone in tackling the crisis in the euro area? We are independent of governments, and vice versa. There is dialogue between the various European institutions, but there is a concern that monetary policy is the sole response to the current crisis. That would be doomed to failure. Does the ECB’s quantitative easing signal a return to currency wars? There are no currency wars at present. The depreciation of the euro is the result of differences between the euro area and the United States in terms of their respective positions in the economic cycle and, accordingly, their monetary policies. Our partners recognise that our monetary policy decisions are appropriate given the situation in the euro area. This is not a question of seeking to influence the euro’s exchange rate, in respect of which the ECB has no specific objectives. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3. Greece Could the ECB find itself on the front line when it comes to saving Greece if the negotiations fail? Could it end up having to print money? Will this involve it operating outside of the European treaties? We are already on the front line and we are fully playing our part as the central bank responsible for all 19 countries that share the single currency, including Greece. The liquidity provided to Greek banks by the Eurosystem (the ECB and the Bank of Greece) has increased from €45 billion in December 2014 to €119 billion today, which gives you an idea of the extent of the support provided by the ECB to Greek firms and households. However, our ability to act is governed by rules stemming from the treaties, which have been approved by European citizens: on the one hand, we can only lend to Greek banks if they are solvent and provide collateral, and on the other hand, we are not allowed to lend to the Greek government (or any other government). It is for the governments of the euro area, which together form the Eurogroup, to decide whether they wish to lend to the Greek government and under what conditions, not for the ECB. In 2012 Mario Draghi said he would do whatever it takes to save the euro, but within the ECB’s mandate. The ECB is an institution that has powerful instruments, but it can only use them within the narrow scope that has been set for it by the treaties, under the supervision of the European Parliament and the Court of Justice of the European Union. Respecting the law is fundamental to respecting democracy. That being said, I refuse to discuss a Greek exit from the euro area because we are not working within that framework. We are financing the Greek economy and we are working alongside the IMF and the European Commission to secure an agreement with Athens, with the aim of keeping Greece in the euro area. Should Greece’s debt be restructured? This question is not taboo, as the Greek debt has already been restructured for private banks. As for the public creditors, they have already agreed to significant adjustments regarding the extension of repayment periods and rate cuts, with the result that the Greek debt burden is now significantly lower than that of Italy or Spain as a percentage of national income. Should more be done? The answer will depend on the final terms of the agreement between the creditors and the Greek authorities. This is the yardstick against which we will reassess the sustainability of the debt. The money that is at stake belongs to taxpayers in euro area countries, so it is for their governments, not the ECB, to make decisions in this regard. Could the ECB make some kind of gesture? The ECB’s claims on Greece stem not from loans that have been granted to the country, but from bonds purchased in the capital markets at the height of the crisis to improve the transmission of our monetary policy decisions. We are not allowed to restructure them, as the treaties prohibit us from providing financial assistance to states. The negotiations between Greece and its creditors seem to be a dialogue of the deaf… The goal is to strike a balance between the programme of a newly elected government that has strong democratic legitimacy and the interests of the other euro area countries, which are also democracies. The issue is not just the reforms that are necessary for Greece, but also the fact that these reforms are financed by taxpayers in other countries, who have also been affected by the crisis. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Would a Greek exit from the euro area trigger the demise of the single currency? The ECB, I reiterate, wants Greece to remain in the euro area. If, one day, a country were to leave the euro area, that would be a serious warning sign for Europe, because the question would inevitably arise as to whether such a scenario could be repeated. But the answer to this question is widely known – it seems to me that there is a broad consensus concerning the conditions that enable each country to benefit from the advantages of the euro on a lasting basis. These conditions include accountability before, and solidarity towards, peers. These common values should be reflected in national and European institutions. Incidentally, the countries that have committed themselves to these values have successfully overcome the crisis (notably Spain and Ireland). So I am not at all worried about the cohesion of the euro area. But if a country were to decide to depart from this consensus, that would undoubtedly oblige the other countries to unequivocally consolidate their commitment to the values I just mentioned by accelerating the process of strengthening the euro area. This would entail the acceleration of a process of institutional reflection which is currently a long-term endeavour. Is the IMF being too demanding? The IMF has a different mandate and different shareholders from the European institutions. It works on behalf of 188 countries, most of which are not in the euro area and have a standard of living lower than that of Greece. So the IMF has concerns regarding equal treatment that I think are entirely legitimate. 4. The institutions Is the euro area today strong enough to face up to a new crisis? Yes, I am certain it is. Thorough reforms have been implemented since 2010 to reinforce the responsibilities of member countries (notably in fiscal matters), as well as solidarity between them (with the creation of the European Stability Mechanism), while the banking union strengthens banking supervision and has broken the financial link between banks and states. But we are still only halfway there. We have not yet reached the point where we can be completely at ease about the strength of the euro area in the long term. It is essential that each country implements responsible policies. Economic policies and structural reforms need to be better coordinated, in the common interest, so that each economy becomes more resistant to shocks. The resilience of the euro area as a whole must also be strengthened. This could be achieved, for example, by giving the euro area a specific budgetary capacity, the use of which would be subject to democratic oversight. The presidents of the European Council, the European Commission, the Eurogroup and the ECB will soon publish proposals on these issues. Hasn’t the euro been a failure, given the substantial divergence among the 19 countries that share the single currency? No, the euro has not been a failure. It has given our firms access to larger markets and brought about more favourable financing conditions. It is also a symbol that unites Europeans and to which they attach value. The financing conditions which led to the crisis? The euro did not cause the crisis. What led to the crisis was that we allowed money to be invested in non-productive activities, like the housing market. We also allowed certain countries to file false accounts and accumulate debt far beyond reasonable levels. This must 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  be rectified, but the existence of the euro itself has spurred growth in the euro area. Now we have to continue to identify, one by one, the sources of weakness, and propose solutions. What role can the ECB play in the face of the rise of populist movements? Many people believe that it is not a democratic institution… The best way to respond to Euroscepticism is to create growth. I repeat, we are using the tools at our disposal to work towards this. Everyone should do likewise. The ECB is a European institution that has been given certain duties to perform, within a democratic framework. The treaties have been validated through a democratic process. The ECB is accountable to the European Parliament, and it is becoming more and more transparent. It nowadays also explains its actions to national parliaments. We have also increased transparency regarding our decisions by publishing the minutes of monetary policy meetings. One day, I am sure, we will publish how the different members of the Governing Council vote. We have already come a long way in this regard, and we will continue to follow this path. Will the ECB save the euro? The euro is no longer in danger in the way that it could have been three years ago. But your question is revealing – it shows that society’s expectations of central banks are still excessive. In one respect, the fact that the ECB is independent of political constraints means that everyone pins their (unrealistic) hopes on it in terms of economic policy. But this is unreasonable! If too much is asked of central banks, they will become beholden to vested interests and less effective, losing their legitimacy in the process. But isn’t this evolution of the role of central banks irreversible? The best response is to show that we can consolidate growth without relying on monetary policy. This is the biggest issue for the coming months and years. To fulfil their goals in an extraordinary economic environment, central bankers have had to take no less extraordinary decisions that have placed them centre stage. As soon as stability returns, I have no doubt that they will return to their ploughs, like Cincinnatus in Roman times. Are you a candidate for the position of Governor of the Banque de France? This is a decision for the French President alone. The Banque de France is the ECB’s second-largest shareholder. It is a magnificent institution that should continue to make its voice heard in the euro area and in global financial debates.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  John Mourmouras: Divergent monetary policies and global capital markets Speech by Professor John Mourmouras, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the session “The role of central banks today” of the XXIV International Banking Congress,  St. Petersburg, 4 June 2015. *      *      * Governors, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here in St. Petersburg and I would like to thank the Governor of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, for inviting me to this international congress attended by distinguished representatives of the finance industry and the central banking sector. I would like to make a few remarks on the potential financial consequences of divergent monetary policies, which remain a dominant theme in the global financial environment. Afterwards, I will be happy to answer any questions posed by the panel or the floor. 1. Introduction Global growth and inflation prospects, while not as dire as a few months ago, are far from robust. Notwithstanding the slow steps by the Federal Reserve (Fed) towards normalisation of monetary policy in the US, the central bank community today remains ultra-loose, with the certainty of further stimulus in Europe and Japan in the months ahead and the likelihood of monetary easing in China and elsewhere. The Greek debt crisis still remains pending and there are also downside risks on the geopolitical front, even in this region (e.g. the events in Ukraine, particularly with the Minsk II ceasefire under increasing strain). Several central banks (including all four major, i.e. the US Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan) have engaged in unconventional monetary policies, including large-scale asset purchase programmes, and forward guidance about the future path of monetary policy. We have also lately witnessed discretionary policy actions by an increasing number of central banks with direct effects on the foreign exchange value of their currencies, naturally raising concerns about a recourse to beggar-thy-neighbour policies and competitive devaluations. The consensus among analysts is that a period of divergent monetary policies among central banks will last for quite some time, giving rise to a number of important questions to be addressed, to mention but two: (a) what are the effects and the channels of the international transmission of monetary policy today, (b) what are the spillovers from the policies of major central banks to the rest of the world, including emerging markets, in terms of capital flows, bond markets and exchange rates, and if there is any scope for global monetary policy coordination. I propose to focus on the following three remarks. Firstly, I will discuss the ECB’s ongoing expanded asset purchase programme (QE) and its impact on the euro area economy. Secondly, I will discuss how divergent monetary policies among the world’s leading central banks may trigger excessive volatility in global financial markets. Last but not least, I will examine if there is any scope for global monetary policy coordination that can effectively address the risks that lie behind “asymmetric” monetary policies. 2. Draghi’s qe: an early evaluation First of all, I will explain why it is that we talk about low inflation, rather than deflation, in the euro area. Inflation is expected to remain very low or slightly negative in the coming months, with an average inflation projection of 0.3% for the year 2015, against a yearly average of 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  0.4% in 2014. In advanced economies, the inflation rate will stand at 0.4% on a yearly basis in 2015, according to the latest IMF forecasts, which is the lowest level in the last 30 years, and in EMEs at 5.4%, one of the lowest in the last 20 years. Although in the euro area, there is more than a 50% risk of the inflation rate hovering below one percent in the short-run, the risk of deflation is quite low at less than 10% in the short term (in the next one to two years) and effectively zero (1% risk) in the longer term (in the next five years). Despite recent monthly inflation “dips” to negative levels there is no deflationary bias embedded in wage contracts and consumer behaviour in the euro area, as opposed to the inflationary bias we have experienced over the past three decades (1980s-1990s-2000s). Ultimately, the ECB should fulfil its mandate, as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is expected to reach 1.8% in 2017, which is consistent with the primary goal of price stability, i.e. maintaining the euro area inflation rate below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me now quickly refer to the key features of the ECB’s recent asset purchase programme and focus mainly on the impact of QE, which judging from preliminary evidence, is really encouraging. The key elements of the programme are the following: (a) Monthly asset purchases will amount to €60 billion of private and sovereign debt. The programme will amount to a total of €1.1 trillion in asset purchases carried out from March 2015 until September 2016. (b) Loss-sharing is reserved for those purchases that are carried out by the ECB, accounting for 20% of the total purchases. The remaining 80% of all purchases – i.e. purchases made by NCBs – will not be subject to loss-sharing. Since the announcement of the ECB’s QE on 22 January, projections for real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 have been revised upwards (to 1.5% and 1.9%, respectively) compared with December 2014. Furthermore, model-based estimates indicate that market-based measures of inflation expectations have reacted positively to the progressive expansion of the ECB’s balance sheet over the last few months and have been revised upwards, as well. As far as financial markets are concerned, the impact of the asset purchase programme accounts for most of the fall in euro area long-term sovereign bond yields since last December, as market participants anticipated the ECB’s QE programme. Government bonds across a wide range of euro area countries traded at historically low, and often negative, yields. The decline was most pronounced in the longest maturities, with yields on French and German 10-year bonds falling by around 60 basis points, while those on Italian and Portuguese bonds of the same maturity shrank by 70 and 90 basis points, respectively. The major European stock markets have risen since end-2014 by about 17%. Furthermore, the euro depreciated by 11% since last December, hitting a 12-year low against the dollar (for a more detailed assessment of the ECB’s QE, see my earlier speech at the 33rd Meeting of Central Bank Governors’ Club in Shanghai on 15 May 2015, available at: http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/ Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=317&List_ID=b2e9402e-db05–4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b). Following the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy (with standard and non-standard measures) other central banks adopted similar policies. For instance, in Europe, the Central Bank of Denmark cut its key policy rate, taking it to the negative territory of –0.75%, while the Central Bank of Sweden (Riksbank), with a base rate of –0.25%, has announced it will expand its quantitative easing programme (the Riksbank pledged to buy between SKr40 billion and SKr50 billion (US $4.8–6 billion) of government bonds, taking the total stock of Swedish sovereign debt held by the central bank to between SKr80 billion and SKr90 billion and its share of all Swedish government debt to 15%) in an effort to stimulate the economy. In total, from the start of the year, 22 central banks lowered their official rates (including the Bank of Russia, which, since last December’s drastic rise to 17%, lowered its interest rates three consecutive times, the last time being in April, when rates were cut by 1.5 percentage points to 12.5%). In light of all this, one can speak of a period of truly global monetary easing! 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  3. Divergent monetary policies and capital markets Some theory Many analysts believe that purchases by central banks are the dominant cause of low bond yields today. Apparently, this has to be a factor since a QE programme, by its very nature, is an extension of the intervention horizon of monetary policy and as such it has a direct impact on long-term interest rates (the average maturity of the securities bought by the ECB under its QE programme is 8.1 years). However, a far more important determinant of low bond yields today is the expectation that short-term rates will stay low, which in turn reflects expectations of low and persistent inflation and of a weak and uncertain recovery. Perhaps theory is useful here. Theory suggests that long-term interest rates should be a weighted average of expected short-term interest rates plus a term premium. The premium should normally be positive, even in the absence of default risk. Longer-term securities are riskier than short-term ones, because their prices are volatile. Expected short-term nominal rates should be determined by expected real interest rates and expected inflation, and expected changes in real interest rates should, in turn, be determined by the expected balance of savings and investment. Finally, other factors, such as risk aversion also affect the prices of long-term bonds. What do all the above suggest about the future path of yields? The sharp rises in expected short-term interest rates and hence in long-term yields (the term structure of interest rates in theoretical terms) are only likely to follow a strong recovery and subsequently a sharp rise in inflation expectations (in empirical terms, historically, sovereign bond yields and, to a lesser extent, exchange rates track nominal GDP growth rates). We are not there yet: only with a robust recovery in Europe and a monetary policy normalisation in the US can markets start pricing risk in a traditional manner. The recent bond sell-off It is true, though, that the last days of April saw the beginning of a sharp sell-off in sovereign bonds across the euro area bond markets, leading to soaring volatility in European bond markets, a sharp steepening in the yield curve and an appreciation of the euro. The figures are quite spectacular as is often the case with the markets: in just 17 working days, the global sovereign bond index lost more than €0.5 trillion of its value! This is an upward correction in bond yields from an early overshooting of bond prices (early undershooting of the exchange rate), which marked the first significant adjustment in European sovereign bond markets since mid-2013 (triggered in turn by the Federal Reserve’s tapering of its asset purchases). The 10-year Bund yield increased from a historical low of 7.5 bps on 20 April to over 80 bps by early June. As for the other euro area countries, yields in France and other core countries increased in a similar way, while the spreads of peripheral bonds over the Bund have narrowed. Turning to the US government bond market, and given the strong co-movement of 10-year German and US government bond yields (with a high correlation coefficient of .80), the 10-year US Treasury yields rose substantially to reach their highest closing levels this year in the region of 2.30%, as the contagion from the European bond sell-off was the main driver of their recent rise. Given the fact that recent US macro data were mixed and the uncertainty surrounding the Fed’s rate hike timing, there was additional volatility in US yields spilling over to Bunds and other euro area countries, with the interest rate differential set to remain in the region of 1.50%. In addition, the widening gap between US and euro area interest rates is also driving US companies to issue more euro-denominated debt as it seems cheaper in interest rate differential terms. In short, apart from some technical conditions (e.g. shorter-dated German Bunds which became eligible, while they were previously not, because of their negative yields, and hence there was less need to buy longer-dated bonds and/or volatility clustering in global bond markets, namely that volatility in itself generates further volatility), this recent bond sell-off reveals vulnerabilities in the current low-yield/low-inflation environment and can also be regarded as an evident financial implication of divergent monetary policies. One should not forget that there is still another trillion left from Draghi’s QE programme to be paid. Finally, 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  some analysts claim that an issue of macroprudential policy arises here which, as is well-known, addresses risks to the financial system as a whole. More precisely, the ECB’s implementation of the expanded asset purchase programme in the current juncture might necessitate the use of existing macroprudential tools to oversee any fallout from the credit expansion preventing or at least moderating asset market bubbles, or even the creation of new tools, for instance to address pressures in the insurance sector as a result of the low-yield environment in which they operate today. Capital flows The repercussions on the world economy of the redirection of a major central bank’s monetary policy and/or of divergent global monetary policies which sharply alter global exchange rates, is one of the oldest questions in international monetary economics and was posed again recently, when the Fed launched its Quantitative Easing (QE) programme. At the time, the Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil expressed his strong dismay at the loosening of the Fed’s monetary policy and its impact on emerging countries, in the form of large capital inflows triggering a sharp appreciation of their currencies and a decline in exports. It is indeed quite difficult to predict the precise form of (sometimes conflicting) spillover effects stemming from such a change in the monetary policy stance. For instance, the Fed’s Quantitative Easing 1 (QΕ1) programme was followed by capital flows out of emerging economies (EMEs) into US Treasuries, while the second round of Quantitative Easing (QΕ2) had the exact opposite effect. Since then, the Fed’s change of tack has once again spurred intense reactions in EMEs (see recent statements of the Reserve Bank of India Governor): the tapering of the Fed’s asset purchase programme has resulted in massive capital flows into advanced economies and a subsequent sharp rise in interest rates in emerging economies to prevent a sharp devaluation of their currencies (the currencies of Brazil, South Africa and Turkey were particularly hard-hit). Their large current account deficits are typically financed with short-term portfolio flows and in the case of Brazil and South Africa, falling commodity prices added further pressure. Up to now, there are no clear indications of international portfolio rebalances due to the upcoming interest rate hike by the Fed and/or the QE programme currently implemented by the ECB. 4. Monetary policy coordination? We have just looked into the negative spillover effects from divergent monetary policies. Of course, a central bank’s mandate is domestic, but its policy may have global implications. Furthermore, in an international macroeconomic environment of subdued and uneven growth and high unemployment, zero lower-bound interest rates and a tight fiscal policy stance, certain nations may attempt to use their monetary policies – through standard or non-standard measures – in order to influence their exchange rate to bolster their economy and boost employment. The question thus arises whether monetary authorities should act in a coordinated manner during this final stage in the exit from the global crisis and at a time when foreign exchange rates are not an official monetary policy objective in advanced economies. ECB President Mario Draghi, answering a relevant question in an ECB Governing Council press conference on 6 February 2014, stressed that international monetary cooperation cannot be ruled out. Examples of international monetary policy coordination are not rare, but Olivier Blanchard captured reality with the caveat: “it is like the Loch Ness monster that is much discussed, but rarely seen” (15 December 2013). As a matter of fact, a recent notable example of monetary policy coordination among major central banks took place at the onset of the global crisis of 2008, when the world’s four leading central banks (the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan) took coordinated action, affirming the need to go beyond traditional ways of conducting monetary policy in order to continue to provide liquidity to the financial system and prevent a collapse of transactions and a global crash. Hence they established liquidity swap arrangements with the intention to provide foreign currency funding 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  to the banking systems in their jurisdictions. The US Federal Reserve provided US $500 billion to other major central banks over the 2008–2010 period, while the others used liquidity swap lines to a lesser extent. While international cooperation between central banks has been quite common in the field of foreign exchange markets, this occasion marked the first multilateral central bank cooperation in the money markets field, which is central to the implementation of a central bank’s monetary policy. It is worth reminding that in the past, serious initiatives for coordinated monetary policy have been taken under the 1985 Plaza Accord and the 1987 Louvre Accord in order to stabilise the dollar exchange rate. If things move towards such a policy coordination, it should in my view take the following form: i) the Fed could perhaps extend a new swap line to the central banks of EMEs, like the swap lines it offered at the start of the global crisis (a kind of formal policy coordination), and/or ii) a commitment on the part of the four major central banks to communicate their monetary policies in a clear and timely manner within the context of their forward guidance policies, as was agreed in a G20 Meeting in 2014, (a kind of informal policy coordination, whereby major CBs are mindful of the consequences of their actions). Such forward guidance will enable emerging economies to promptly protect themselves against sharp and significant capital flows and develop policies to avoid exclusive dependence on speculative capital flows which render them vulnerable to excessive volatility in the financial markets. At the current juncture, major central banks should signal future interest rate changes in a timely manner, without any concerns about causing market panic, otherwise investors will continue to overborrow and this would potentially be destabilising. All in all, in the era of globalisation and especially against the background of low and persistent inflation today, some form of coordinated action between major central banks should perhaps be put on the table, particularly given the fact that governments are unable to protect themselves against central bank decisions, which trigger significant capital flows, and the available tools to limit such capital flows are not efficient. Thank you very much for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stefan Gerlach: Making residential rental markets work for financial stability Address by Mr Stefan Gerlach, Deputy Governor (Central Banking) of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the Twenty-First Dubrovnik Economic Conference, Dubrovnik, 8 June 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found on the Central Bank of Ireland’s website. I would like to thank Amelia Dennigan, Gabriel Fagan, John Flynn, Robert Kelly, Maurice McGuire, Cyril Roux, Rebecca Stuart and, in particular, Therese Grace for their help in preparing this speech. 1. Introduction I am very pleased to be here in Dubrovnik at the 21st Dubrovnik Economic Conference. Today I will talk about rental markets and financial stability. While the rental market is currently a focus of attention in many countries, including Ireland1, the link with financial stability, a preoccupation of central banks, is an issue that is frequently neglected in the important public debate about housing. Before proceeding, I note that while housing policies are outside the remit of central banks, any financial stability concerns they raise are not. In this talk, I therefore hope to draw attention to these issues, while recognising that it is for others to set specific policies in these areas. My talk is motivated by three observations on housing markets through the crisis: first, while owner-occupancy rates increased prior to the crisis, during the recent crisis we saw owner-occupancy rates fall. Consequently, the number of renters rose in many countries affected by housing market downturns, including Ireland. This indicates that for many people of household formation age, the rental market acts as a backstop, which they turn to in times of uncertainty and tight credit conditions. My second observation is that empirical evidence shows that economies in which the rental market was relatively large and deep suffered less during the financial crisis. Deep rental markets thus appear to promote the resilience of the economy to adverse shocks and are therefore desirable from an economic stability perspective. To promote their development, it is important that renting is an attractive long-term proposition for households and landlords alike. My third and final observation arises from the fact that, as the economy recovered in Ireland, the housing market took off rapidly, with property prices increasing by over 20 per cent in 2014, having fallen by more than 12 per cent just two years earlier (indeed, in January 2015, the Central Bank of Ireland introduced loan-to-value and loan-to-income limits to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to reduce the risk of bank credit and house price spirals from developing in the future).2 This pick-up is often attributed to “pent-up” demand for owner-occupied housing which built-up during the crisis years when credit was scarce and there was uncertainty about the path of house prices.3 Whatever its causes, it indicates that, while people are willing to rent on a short-term basis, there is a strong preference for owner-occupied housing over rented accommodation.                                                 1 See, in particular, the recent report by the National Economic and Social Council (NESC (2015)). 2 See Central Bank of Ireland press release and associated documentation, 27 January 2015. 3  The effect has also been exacerbated by the low levels of new house building during the crisis years, which has resulted in local supply shortages. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  2. The financial crisis To put the role of the housing market in perspective, it is useful to start by reviewing the depth of the recent economic crisis. One measure of the adversity of outcomes is the loss of potential output, shown in Chart 1 for a sample of 24 countries.4 These losses arose from the crisis reducing the level and perhaps also the growth rate of the economy’s productive potential. Another measure is the increase in the unemployment rate between 2005 and 2014, shown for a sample of 19 countries in Chart 2. Furthermore, Chart 3 indicates that there is a high correlation between output losses and house price declines. Those countries that experienced the greatest losses had the largest house price decreases after the crisis. These charts illustrate that Croatia and Ireland both fared particularly poorly in the crisis: they experienced large losses of potential output, large increases in unemployment and large falls in real property prices. They also make clear that there are great differences between countries in economic outcomes. While the travails of Croatia and Ireland might simply have been due to bad luck, credit-fuelled housing bubbles played a big part in both countries’ pre-crisis growth and subsequent decline. It is this aspect that I will focus on and, in particular, the role that deep and well-developed rental markets can play in helping to reduce the effects of shocks to housing markets. 3. What is the role of rental markets? So what is the role of rental markets in the downturn? As shown by Chart 4, the proportion of the population which rents property, that is the rental rate, varies among industrialised economies from just over 60 per cent in Switzerland to under 20 per cent in Spain and Croatia.5 The rental rate is low in all English-speaking countries, ranging from 36 per cent in Canada to 26 per cent in Ireland. Indeed, rental rates increased in a number of countries that experienced housing market turmoil during the crisis years. Consider a simplified scenario where all people in an economy finish school at 18, save for 10 years and then buy a house. In this scenario, a predictable number of people enter the housing market every year: those who turn 28 years of age.6 When a shock hits the economy, house purchase is delayed, either because of uncertainty about the future direction of house prices, or because of a lack of credit. This delay in house purchase results in people moving into the rental market. A deep rental market is better placed to absorb such an increase in demand than a thin rental market. This is because the increase in demand will be a smaller portion of the overall size of the market. Moreover, compared to a situation in which no new household formation takes place in times of uncertainty, this switch in preferences from owner-occupancy to rented accommodation can have an important stabilising effect on housing markets. As house prices fall and demand for rental properties pushes up rents, yields on rental properties increase, making it attractive to become a landlord instead of selling at a depressed price. In Ireland, it is estimated that 36 per cent of landlords are “accidental landlords” who found themselves with a property that they could not sell as a result of the housing market crash.7 Rent received on these properties has enabled landlords to meet outstanding mortgage repayments, and thus helped them avoid falling into mortgage arrears. Moreover, as prices fall, the rental yield on a                                                 4 These losses are computed by Ball (2014). 5 Due to limited cross-country data availability, rental rate data include households in both private and publicly-provided rental accommodation. 6 See Miles (2011) for a discussion of such effects. 7 RedC Survey results reported in Housing Agency (2014). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  property is likely to rise, encouraging new landlords into the market and helping to create a floor to house prices. Overall, a deep and well-established rental market therefore seems to be a mitigant against the effect of shocks to the broader economy and housing markets. This is clear in cross-country data. Chart 5 contains a scatterplot of losses in potential output during the crisis against rental rates and Chart 6 shows the relationship between rental rates and changes in unemployment. In both these cases a clear negative relationship is readily apparent. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is a link between the depth of the rental market and the severity of macroeconomic outcomes during the recent crisis. 4. The role of mortgage debt in a financial crisis There are of course also a number of social benefits from owner-occupancy which need to be kept in mind. For instance, owner-occupancy represents the purchase of an asset and, since mortgage loans are amortised in Ireland, therefore leads to wealth accumulation. This can be particularly helpful in retirement, when reduced income can be offset by the lower cost of outright ownership of housing. In addition, studies have shown that homeowners are more engaged in social and political activities, have more positive assessments of their neighbourhoods, better psychological health and higher educational attainments.8 Surveys in the US show that homeowners believe their neighbourhoods are safer and better places to raise children.9  But while the benefits of owner-occupancy are well documented, there is a much less well-known flipside to this coin: the risks associated with financially vulnerable households taking on the financial burden of house purchase. Let me now discuss this issue. In Ireland the burden of the current crisis has fallen squarely on the young, many of whom bought property at the top of the market. The perception that one must get “on the property ladder” as soon as possible that was a particular feature of the boom years, but also a consequence of the poorly functioning rental market in Ireland, has had implications for younger families. Many of these are now left with unsuitable properties for their housing needs (for example, one bedroom apartments that are not satisfactory for growing families), and with debts that they could no longer service when salaries declined and unemployment rose during the economic downturn. Moreover, negative equity and mortgage arrears may make it difficult for them to move in pursuit of new, or better paid, employment. While desirable and beneficial for many, homeownership does come together with important risks that many neglected before the onset of the crisis. A particular concern in this regard is the fact that the risk of becoming unemployed or experiencing income losses is not evenly shared across society. Younger and less experienced workers, and those who work in industries that are sensitive to the business cycle, such as the construction sector, are particularly exposed to the risk of unemployment. This is illustrated by Chart 7 which shows that the crisis has disproportionately affected unemployment rates among younger age cohorts in Ireland. Graduate salaries have declined significantly since 2007, which has long-term implications for the earning potential of young people.10 Chart 8 shows that employment in the sectors most vulnerable to the economic cycle, such as construction, has been most adversely affected by the crisis. Thus, the lack of a deep and well-functioning rental market forces all households, including those at a relatively high risk of unemployment, into the property market. While the great                                                 8 See Rohe and Lindblad (2013) for a discussion of the benefits of homeownership. 9 See Belsky (2013). 10 Conefrey and Smith (2014). 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  majority of borrowers are credit worthy and will service their loans, unemployment and income loss, which may be caused by the unemployment of a spouse or partner, have been important determinants of mortgage arrears in Ireland.11 Banks in economies with very high house ownership rates may therefore experience high credit losses in a downturn. The resulting link between highly-indebted and financially more vulnerable households and the banking sector can create a cycle which is both self-reinforcing in good times with expectations of increasing capital values increasing equity and enabling greater indebtedness, and in bad times as both banks and households suffer losses. What role can rental markets play? Buying a house using a mortgage is a risky leveraged investment that involves a household borrowing several times its annual income to buy an asset with an uncertain future value. Such investments should only be entered into by those that understand the risks and feel able to assume them. Moreover, the rental market can alleviate the risk of capital loss and negative equity, increase labour mobility and thus facilitate the adjustment following adverse economic shocks. From a financial stability perspective it is therefore important that households that worry about the risks of homeownership have the option, if they wish, to rent a property that provides the type and quality of housing, and security of tenure, that they require. Let me next turn to the rental market. 5. The private rental market It is clear that in Ireland, in contrast to elsewhere in Europe, renting a home is not seen as a long-term option for households. Indeed, results from a recent survey show that over 70 per cent of private rental tenants would prefer to own their own property, and just 17 per cent wish to rent long-term.12 While this may reflect a cultural preference, or the benefits of homeownership, it seems more than likely that the type, quality, affordability and, in particular, security of tenure of private rented accommodation also plays an important role. What can be done to make renting a more attractive long-term alternative to homeownership? I believe that there are three aspects to this problem: first, the rental market structure, particularly in terms of security of tenure, can play a role. Second, the investment horizons of landlords are important. A culture whereby the market is dominated by landlords seeking an income stream over the long term, rather than a capital gain in the short run, can help raise the attractiveness of renting in a number of ways. Finally, in many countries, policies aim to specifically incentivise homeownership, to the detriment of the rental market. 5.1 Security of tenure A particular concern in Ireland is the absence of long-term rental contracts; while households may wish to stay for long periods in their accommodation, rental contracts in Ireland are predominantly of a year’s duration. This leads to a wide-spread lack of security of tenure. Indeed, a recent survey indicated that 23 per cent of private tenants in Ireland are afraid of losing their home. In addition, 32 per cent have no formal lease, even though more than half have been living in their current accommodation for more than two years.13 The risk and the associated costs of having to move may make households opt to purchase their own home and take on financial risks that they may feel they are not well placed to assume. Indeed, 29 per cent of tenants say that they would be more likely to rent long term if there was the possibility of a longer term lease.14 Lengthening rental contracts therefore seems desirable.15                                                 11 McCarthy (2014). 12 RedC survey reported Housing Agency (2014). 13 Housing sentiment survey conducted by iREACH, reported in NABCO (2014). 14 Housing Agency (2014). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Interestingly, research has shown that in countries with comparatively strong security of tenure and high rental rates, such as Germany and the Netherlands, security of tenure is seen to foster long-run demand for renting and rental investment, such that neither tenants nor landlords have sought to weaken security.16  Why are rental contracts in Ireland of such short term nature? Ireland’s history of high and variable inflation and the lack of institutional investors in the rental market must both be important. In economies with a history of inflation, banks protect themselves by lending at flexible interest rates. In turn, with mortgage costs varying over time, renters protect themselves with short term contracts. In contrast, in economies with a history of low and stable inflation, mortgage lending tends to be for long maturities and rental contracts tend to be longer term. Of course, Ireland’s history of inflation is now over. But lending arrangements change slowly. Overall, housing markets and financial stability in Ireland would benefit from borrowers having a wider choice of fixed rate loans. 5.2 Incentives of landlords The lack of institutional investors in the rental market is also important. The Irish rental market is dominated by private households who let a single property.17 The fact that they may need the dwelling for a family member, or may wish to sell it, is another factor that makes for short-term contracts and concerns about the security of tenure. Furthermore, buy-to-let properties have the highest rate of mortgage arrears. The latest figures from December 2014 show that over 25 per cent of buy-to-let mortgages are in arrears. Indeed, survey findings suggest almost 50 per cent of all landlords18 cannot cover their loan repayments with rental income. Overall, 29 per cent of landlords intend to exit the market as soon as possible.19  In contrast, institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have very long investment horizons and have strong preferences for tenants who stay for an extended period of time, since finding new tenants and refurbishing apartments for them is costly.20 Institutional investors can bring a standardised, professional approach to the management of entire buildings of apartments, aiding the supply of suitable accommodation in popular areas. This suggests that attracting more institutional investors would promote a well-functioning rental market that is so important for financial stability.21 Furthermore, these investors are likely to be less leveraged and have more diversified portfolios than individuals owning one or two rental properties, and are thus better able to withstand an economic downturn.                                                                                                                                                    15 NESC (2015) discusses security of tenure in depth. 16 See De Boer and Bitetti (2014). 17 See Housing Agency (2014) which suggests that over 80 per cent of landlords own one or two properties. 18 Including those without outstanding debts. 19 Housing Agency (2014). 20 As do private households that invest in property for purposes such as additional income in retirement. In Germany, where many people rent for extended periods, a large share of landlords are individuals, however, they do so for retirement purposes rather than capital gains, and are therefore interested in a steady income stream from long-term tenants (see ECB (2009), particularly Box 3). 21 To this end, Budget 2013 introduced Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to Ireland. To date, approximately 1,500 residential units have been acquired by REITs. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  There is a wide variety of government intervention in rental market, from the direct provision of social housing to the regulation of the private rented sector.22 Because moving is costly and disruptive, the tenant-landlord relationship is inherently asymmetric. Regulation, if designed well, can therefore improve outcomes. That said, poorly thought out regulation, in particular rent controls, can have adverse effects by reducing the supply of rental properties and discouraging new construction and the maintenance of existing rental properties. Getting housing regulation “right” – a task outside the central bank’s remit – is important. 5.3 Policies favouring home-ownership Home-ownership brings many benefits, and it is understandable that there are policies in place to enable house purchase; I have already outlined the potential benefits in terms of asset accumulation and social advantages associated with home-ownership. However, some policies aimed at enabling people to gain from the benefits of home-ownership have the effect of worsening the situation of those who either choose not to be homeowners, or cannot afford to be so. One important issue that influences households’ choices between buying and renting property is tax policy. In many countries it is generally favourable towards homeownership. Examples of favourable taxation treatment of housing include the exemption of imputed rental income on principal homes from income tax calculations, tax relief of mortgage interest payments, exemptions of capital gains from the sale of principal homes, and the use of outdated housing values for property taxes. A favourable tax treatment of homeownership risks encouraging excessive leverage and housing investment, leading to the development of macroeconomic and financial imbalances.23 It can also tempt households that are worried about the risks inherent in mortgage borrowing into house ownership. Overall, it seems desirable for tax policy to be neutral between homeownership and renting. To this end, it is important to note that tax relief on mortgage payments have been phased out since the crisis, and a recurrent property tax has been introduced, in Ireland. 6. Conclusion Economies that experienced boom-bust cycles in housing, such as Croatia and Ireland, suffered disproportionately in the financial crisis. There were numerous reasons for this large impact, many of which are, by now, very familiar. However, it is less frequently noted that those economies with deeper rental markets suffered less. While the specifics of housing policy are outside the remit of central banks, it is incumbent for us to draw attention to issues that relate to financial stability. To reduce the risk and the amplitude of future housing cycles, housing policy needs to consider also financial stability issues. In this regard, it seems particularly important to promote a well-developed rental market as a genuine alternative to ownership, and an attractive investment proposition for potential landlords. While many households may continue to buy rather than rent, we need to make sure that this choice reflects their preferences and does not merely reflect a poorly functioning rental market.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  François Groepe: Recent international and domestic economic developments and changes to the financial regulatory architecture Address by Mr François Groepe, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA) 2015 Investment Seminar, Cape Town, 27 May 2015. *      *      * Introduction Good day ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for inviting me to this seminar and I look forward to sharing my views on the recent international and domestic economic developments, as well as changes to the financial regulatory architecture. Global outlook The global environment facing South Africa remains challenging and fraught with a high degree of uncertainty. Developments in the US, in particular, continue to have spill-over effects on emerging markets in general and South Africa in particular. While it is clear that monetary policy normalisation will (and should) take place, the timing of the initial “lift off” is still uncertain, and dependent on domestic developments in the US, not least in the labour market. This makes each data release a source of volatility, with good news in the payrolls data generally being interpreted that it will bring forward the expected commencement date of the normalisation process. Perhaps of greater importance than the “lift off” itself is the question of the future path of interest rates. The US Fed has gone to great pains to communicate a gradual path, but the “dots” (the interest rate forecasts of the individual members) that illustrate this are subject to a high degree of dispersion and change from meeting to meeting. This reflects the high degree of uncertainty. However, uncertainties in the US economy abound. The economy appeared to be well on the road to recovery in the second half of last year, but the first quarter data disappointed, following an advanced estimate growth rate of 0,2 per cent. The general expectation is that this was due to temporary factors, but risks still remain that it could portend a more general extended slowdown. Furthermore, there is still uncertainty regarding the improvement in the labour market: in particular, whether the improvement is a result of a decline in labour force participation rates, which could reverse should the improvement in the economy be sustained. Finally, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about whether potential growth rates will return to pre-crisis levels or settle at a lower level, and this is likely to have implications for the longer term neutral rate of interest. The Eurozone appears to be improving following a weak few quarters, with positive growth impulses from the weaker euro and lower oil prices. The partial reversal of the oil price suggests that this impulse may be waning. It does however appear that the quantitative easing by the ECB is bearing fruit, but the question remains as to whether the region can sustain the recovery without this support. A question mark also remains regarding the possible contagion effect from the Greek debt crisis. The market reaction to date suggests that this is more contained, unlike the more generalised crisis in 2011 when risk premia on all peripheral Eurozone bonds widened significantly. The Chinese economy continues to focus on rebalancing away from investment to domestic consumption. This has resulted in a downward revision of growth targets, but has also meant that demand for commodities is not as strong as it was previously. While a growth rate of 7 per cent would seem unattainable for South Africa, it is relatively low by recent historical standards for China. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Domestic outlook The spill overs on to South Africa from these developments are significant. The US impact is through the exchange rate and long term bond yields, which are highly correlated with those in the UK. The Eurozone is an important destination for South Africa’s manufactured exports, so a slow recovery is bad for the manufacturing sector, while the (until recently) weaker euro means that the competitive advantage from a weaker rand is undermined. Although the African continent, which has been growing quite robustly, has emerged as one of the main destinations of South Africa’s manufactured exports, there are downside risks to the continent’s growth prospects given the decline in oil and other commodity prices. The slowdown in China has had a marked impact on global commodity prices, resulting in a deterioration of South Africa’s terms of trade, which was only reversed to some extent with the collapse of international oil prices since late last year, but even this windfall has reversed somewhat. So all in all we are indeed facing a challenging international environment. However, it would be wrong to suggest that the subdued outlook for the domestic economy is purely a function of global developments. Domestic factors are also important, and some of them are of our own making. Real GDP for the first quarter of this year slowed down to 1.3 per cent compared to the 4.1 per cent (qqsa) recorded for the final quarter of 2014. This is against the backdrop of the sluggish growth rate of 1,5 per cent for 2014 and which is well below the Bank’s estimate of potential output of between 2,0 and 2,5 per cent. The weak outcome last year was partly due to the impact of protracted strikes in the mining and manufacturing sectors during the year. The Bank estimates the negative impact of these strikes to be in the order of around 1,2 percentage points of GDP. Hopefully, prolonged work stoppages will not be a regular feature each year. The question we need to ask ourselves is why the growth prognosis is so weak. Some of it has to do with the global economy, as I outlined earlier. Secondly, there are binding constraints coming from the electricity supply uncertainties. Our estimate of growth tries to incorporate some element of the impact of load shedding on output. There are two elements here: one is the impact of longer term constraints which hamper new investment, and which is reflected in the overall lower potential output; the other is the impact of load-shedding on existing capacity and therefore on current output. We estimate this latter factor to be in the order of magnitude of around 0,5 percentage points of GDP. Load-shedding appears to have contributed to a general low level of business confidence, as evident in the various confidence indices, but also evident in the very low growth in private sector gross fixed capital formation. In 2014, gross fixed capital formation contracted by 0,4 per cent, driven mainly by the 3,4 per cent contraction in investment by the private sector, which accounts for just under two thirds of capital formation. On a more positive note, in the second half of the year growth was positive, a reversal of the strongly negative trends observed in the first half of the year. However, supply side constraints and low confidence are likely to constrain stronger growth. It is worth noting that the more favourable fixed investment outcomes observed in 2013 were mainly related to renewable energy projects. The main driver of growth in recent years has been the consumption expenditure by households. However, the contribution to growth in 2014 declined by one percentage point to 0,8 percentage points. While we would prefer to have investment-driven growth, even consumption has been relatively subdued for some time, declining to 1,4 per cent in 2014 compared with 2,9 per cent in 2013. A further concern has been the recent sharp drop in consumer confidence, which, according to the FNB/BER survey reached a level of –4 in the first quarter of the year, compared to an average of +5. Factors undermining consumer confidence include the partial reversal of the boost to consumption provided by lower petrol prices; the increase in the marginal tax rate in the February budget; high levels of household indebtedness despite some deleveraging; and continued weak growth in credit extension to households. Employment growth trends are also not supportive in this respect, and although wage growth remains relatively high, the positive net impact on consumption could be offset to some extent by the negative impact on employment from relatively high wage growth. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Inflation is currently well within the inflation target band of 3–6 per cent. However, the focus of monetary policy is not current inflation, which is something that we cannot do anything about, but rather on the inflation trajectory over the relevant policy horizon, i.e. the time period over which monetary policy can have an impact on inflation and which is around  12–18 months ahead. Headline CPI inflation accelerated to 4,5 per cent in April, which is at the mid-point of the target range. The main drivers of the annual increase were housing and utilities (1,3 percentage points), miscellaneous goods and services (1,1 percentage points) as well as food and non-alcoholic beverages (0,8 percentage points). On a monthly basis Headline CPI inflation increased by 0.9 percentage points, up from the recent low of 3,9 per cent in February and which is mainly attributable to the previous decline in the petrol price, which has largely been reversed. As we noted in our monetary policy statement last week, inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months, and is expected to rise to 6,8 per cent on average for the quarter thus temporarily breaching the upper end of the headline inflation target range during the first quarter of 2016. The CPI inflation rate is expected to average 6,1 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Core inflation is forecast to average 5,4 per cent and 5,2 per cent in the outer two years with the persistence in this measure largely being attributed to high levels of wage growth, currency depreciation and inflation expectations that are anchored at the upper end of the target range. There are a number of upside risks to this outlook. The main one emanates from the exchange rate, given the rand’s sensitivity to imminent US Fed monetary tightening. South Africa, along with other emerging markets with wide current account and fiscal deficits are seen to be particularly vulnerable. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty in this regard. How much is already priced in to the exchange rate? Will any weakening be a temporary overshoot? To what extent is this offset by QE in the Eurozone and Japan? We should also recognise that domestic factors also play a role, including the persistently wide current account deficit, weak growth outlook and uncertainty arising from the binding electricity constraints. And finally, in this regard, there is uncertainty regarding the degree of pass-through from the depreciation to inflation. We have seen far more muted pass-through in the past few years, than during previous episodes of rand depreciation and the Bank estimates that actual pass-through could be about half of what is assumed in the forecast model. The uncertainty is whether this represents some form of structural change, or whether it is cyclical – in which case it will increase when growth picks up – or whether some inflexion points exist, beyond which inflation will accelerate. A further issue relates to electricity prices. There is some uncertainty following the application to Nersa for a 25 per cent increase in electricity tariffs. The Bank’s model previously incorporated an increase of around 13 per cent, effective from 1 July 2015, but should a higher increase be granted, we will see further upside pressure on inflation. The above backdrop provides a difficult challenge for monetary policy. It is clear that the main pressures on inflation are supply side shocks, rather than demand pressures which are easier to deal with through monetary policy. At the same time, the growth outlook remains highly constrained. We, however cannot simply ignore supply side developments, as in so doing we could allow inflation expectations to become unanchored. Furthermore, the MPC is concerned about the persistence of the medium term inflation outlook at heightened levels and the significant upside risk to this outlook, which includes electricity tariff increases, the exchange rate and the level of wage settlements. Our focus is therefore sharply on possible second round effects of these shocks to see if it spills over into more generalised inflation. Monetary policy has been accommodative, which has been appropriate in light of the weak real economy. We are however in a hiking cycle and the deteriorating inflation outlook may necessitate policy action as the window for an unchanged stance has narrowed. The pace of normalisation will however be influenced by the data. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Regulatory reforms As you are no doubt aware, the Bank’s mandate has been broadened to more explicitly include financial stability. Following the global financial crisis, it became clear that price stability is a necessary, but insufficient condition for financial stability and it has now become a more explicit mandate of central banks in many countries. While the price stability mandate of the SARB is clearly defined and measureable, its mandate for financial stability is much broader and is a shared responsibility with other stakeholders. National Treasury published a policy document in February 2011 titled A safer financial sector to serve South Africa better, which outlined government’s decision to shift to a Twin Peaks model of financial sector regulation. The Twin Peaks model of financial sector regulation represents a move away from a fragmented regulatory approach which was based on the institution or activity towards a regulatory and supervision model based on objectives. It is envisaged that, once fully implemented, the Twin Peaks system of regulation will focus on a more harmonised system of licensing, supervision, enforcement, customer complaints, an appeal and review mechanism, and consumer advice and education. National Treasury published the second draft of the Financial Sector Regulation Bill in December 2014. This bill proposes to confer upon the Bank the responsibility for financial stability and the oversight of market infrastructure and payment systems. It further proposes the establishment of two regulators, namely a Prudential Authority within the Bank and a new Financial Sector Conduct Authority. The Prudential Authority would supervise the safety and soundness of banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, while the market conduct authority would supervise the way in which financial services firms conduct themselves and treat their customers. This reform forms part of the current broader overhaul of the global regulatory system which aims to address the too-big-to-fail problem of systemically important financial institutions, building resilient financial institutions, reducing the opacity of over-the-counter derivatives markets, mitigating the impact of shadow banking on financial stability, enhancing financial benchmark transparency, and promoting the convergence of accounting standards. Within each of these themes there are a number of regulatory initiatives, such as the regulation of systemically important financial institutions under the too-big-to-fail problem, Basel III and proposals for a basic capital requirement for insurers to strengthen the theme of building resilient financial institutions. The Bank’s main activities in the financial stability arena currently include developing and implementing recovery and resolution plans for systemically important financial institutions, introducing a macroprudential toolkit of policy instruments to contain risks associated with imbalances in the financial system, and applying a top-down stress testing framework to the banking sector in South Africa. Although the Bank’s financial stability mandate is distinct from its price stability mandate, careful consideration is continuously given to the interaction between the Bank’s monetary policy and financial stability objectives. This coordination is facilitated by cross-membership between the Bank’s monetary policy and financial stability committee structures. The main risks from the global and domestic environments that might impact the stability of the domestic financial system and that are monitored continuously in terms of possible mitigating actions include the possibility of severe electricity supply disruptions, volatility and risk aversion in global financial markets, a protracted period of slow growth in the euro area, low growth in the domestic economy and the escalation of global geopolitical tensions. These possible scenarios of potential threats to financial stability are rated according to the likelihood of occurrence and the expected impact on the domestic financial system. The results are captured in a risk assessment matrix and published in the latest Financial Stability Review which was released at the end of April. This publication is aimed at analysing these 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  potential risks to financial stability and to stimulate debate on pertinent financial stability issues. Conclusion It is clear that although the global recovery has started to gain momentum it continues to be erratic and there are a number of downside risks to the global economic growth outlook. The recent partial rebound in the price of crude oil has ameliorated some of the benefits arising from its earlier sharp decline. A further risk is a possible Grexit and other geopolitical risks. On the domestic front, growth continues to disappoint, and the medium term growth outlook is likely to be constrained due to the binding electricity constraints. The inflation outlook has deteriorated to uncomfortable levels recently with inflation expectations remaining close to the upper-end of the target and with further notable upside risk to the outlook. The scale of the regulatory reform process under way is probably the most significant overhaul of the financial regulatory architecture in the last few decades. Despite its ambitious scale, the Bank is making good progress in preparing itself to take up its new responsibilities as set out in the Financial Sector Regulation Bill. Thank you! 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  François Groepe: South Africa’s structural unemployment challenge – the most important issues to be addressed to place South Africa on a sustainable growth path in an effort to reduce unemployment levels Address by Mr François Groepe, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, on the occasion of the release of the 14th UASA South African Employment Report, Johannesburg, 30 April 2015. *      *      * Chairperson, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be part of the proceedings of the day, as we gather here for the release of the 14th UASA Employment Report. This publication has grown in stature over the years and has earned itself a place amongst various high-level publications informing on the state of the South African labour market. This morning, I shall focus on the most important issues to be addressed to place South Africa on a sustainable growth path in an effort to, amongst others reduce the unemployment levels. South Africa counts, among its key challenges, its high level of structural unemployment which is exacerbated by the levels of poverty and inequality in the country. These challenges, in turn, give rise to a host of other socio-economic and socio-political challenges. Earlier policies, such as the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative (ASGISA) (2006), as well as the more recent long-term vision for South Africa, as captured in the National Development Plan first released in 2012, highlight the requirement for economic growth in excess of 5 per cent on a sustained basis to meaningfully make inroads towards reducing the high levels of unemployment. Prior to the global financial crisis in 2008/09, some progress had been made in reducing overall levels of unemployment in the country as strong global and local economic growth resulted in higher levels of output leading to increased demand for labour. South Africa, in fact, had experienced one of its longest periods of uninterrupted economic growth – 55 quarters of growth averaging between 3 and 5,6 per cent annually. As the global economic growth recovered after the financial crisis, albeit hesitantly and unevenly, South Africa lagged behind, growing at rates well below its potential, which had been negatively been impacted by strained relations and industrial action, but also by structural deficiencies such as the electricity load shedding. While South Africa has performed well in managing to largely contain inflation, within the inflation target range, and no doubt assisted in part by the lower international food and oil prices, the country has been less successful in matching levels of growth as experienced in other developing countries. Within the BRICS partnership, South Africa is the smallest economy in terms of its gross domestic product and population size and had both the lowest levels of average growth and employment over the past decade. Of some concern is the fact that South Africa continues to experience levels of inequality that are ranked amongst the most elevated in the world. All these indicators require a renewed focus on both the basic drivers of development, such as education enhancement and interventions that directly address structural barriers to growth and employment. Broadly speaking, any effective solution should not only focus on stimulating growth in key industries, but those industries that are lagging should actively be engaged through appropriate policies. Such policies should improve the micro-foundations of economic growth, which include education and skills training, industrial and trade policy, labour market policies and competition policy. Along these lines the National Development Plan (NDP) has as its central focus the elimination of unemployment, poverty and inequality by 2030. Within this Plan, nine main challenges are being highlighted, namely: 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • The elevated levels of unemployment; • The standard of education, which for a large proportion of learners is arguably of an undesirable quality; • Infrastructure, which is not always optimally located, and which at times is under-maintained and insufficient to foster higher growth rates; • Spatial patterns which exclude the poor from the benefits of development; • An economy is that could be described as overly and unsustainably resource intensive; • A widespread disease burden that is compounded by the challenges faced by the public health system; • Public services that are uneven and often of in certain circumstances of inadequate quality; • The corruption levels that is perceived to be wide spread; and • The perception that exist regarding the divisions within the broader society. The NDP provides a useful framework by which these issues can be addressed in a systematic and structured manner as government actively pursues its implementation. The challenge remains the alignment of medium-term and short-term planning by government in its efforts to effectively implement the NDP. The adoption by cabinet of the Medium Term Strategic Framework for 2014 to 2019 for each outcome of the NDP is clear evidence of the government’s commitment towards the successful implementation of the NDP. The key pillars of the Medium Term Strategic Framework comprise the following: • Infrastructure programmes must lead to a crowding in of productive investment as government spending boosts the demand for goods, leading to increased private demand for new output sources, such as factories; • Growth and employment of the productive sectors of our economy should be supported; • Red tape and the unintended consequences of regulation should be reduced; • Skills planning, to address the needs of the economy, should be improved; • The level of employment in agriculture should be increased; • Growth and investment should be supported by sustainable fiscal policies; • Strong partnerships, with business and labour, should be built and workplace conflict should be reduced; • Public Employment Programmes should be scaled up; • Economic opportunities for historically excluded and vulnerable groups should be expanded; and • Investment in research, development and innovation should be supported. Returning now to the NDP, as part of a broader development agenda, business investment is being identified as a cornerstone to create 11-million jobs and eliminate poverty in South Africa by 2030. It sets a target of reducing the unemployment rate from its current level of 25 per cent to 14 per cent in 2020 and to 6 per cent in 2030 and to increase the labour force participation rate from 54 per cent to 65 per cent. Per capita income is also envisaged to increase from around R50 000 to around R120 000 per year. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The NDP suggests that some labour regulations be relaxed in an effort to encourage business enterprises to employ more easily, as well as lower entry-level wages to facilitate a higher uptake of young people in the jobs market. Some of the proposals in this Plan will no doubt fall within the area of public discourse on possible contestation and will require continued intense negotiations among all social partners in an effort to reach broad consensus in order to secure its implementation. The Plan takes a pragmatic and broad-based approach to the challenges that South Africa faces in eradicating unemployment. The role that the Plan sees for government’s intervention is permeated with a willingness to work with the private sector, as the plan leans towards less regulation of the economy. The Plan envisages small and expanding companies creating around 90 per cent of the new employment opportunities in the economy in the next 20 years. This will place South Africa in step with global employment trends. Small firms would benefit from bold proposals to drastically reduce so-called “red tape” and improve employment and practices and procedures. The NDP strives towards an economy that will be more enabling for business entry and expansion, with a focus on credit and market access. Cognisance is taken of the fact that any inclusive growth strategy that does not harness the creativity, innovation and competitiveness of the private sector is unlikely to succeed. Regulatory reform and support being advocated by the Plan has the intention to boost mass entrepreneurship. The topic of strained labour relations is also addressed, indicating that it is inconceivable, that the economy will evolve into a more labour-intensive structure if tensions between employers and labour persist. Ways need to be found to reduce the probability of the occurrence of lengthy strikes, such as those experienced during last year. These tensions need to be dealt with in a transparent and honest manner and not only by amending labour legislation, in order to be conducive of enhanced labour absorbing growth. As the social partners, re-establish trust among themselves, it will go some way towards the process of reinforcing their social pact. Central to the propositions made in the NDP related to the jobs market, is the statement that over a 20-year horizon wage growth needs to be linked to productivity growth as it is not feasible to sustain a labour absorbing path, unless both are growing in tandem. In an effort to enhance the labour absorption rate of the economy, the Plan has already led to a reduction in the initial cost of employing young labour-market entrants, through the implementation of the Employment Tax Incentive, Act no 26 of 2013 which came into effect on 1 January 2014. This initiative compliments government’s measures to create jobs for young workers and those in special economic zones through offering tax incentives to employers to encourage the employment of these workers. This initiative, according to the Minister of Finance, had led to 200 000 young people being employed, which is significantly in excess of government’s initial expectation of 70 000 within six months of implementation. Furthermore, newly introduced changes to labour legislation, in general, hold the promise of improving the functioning of the labour market, as it better addresses discrimination, and advances the approach of equal pay for work of equal value. These changes will not only benefit young people, but will result in a more equitable labour relations environment in general. Over and above the focus on the jobs market, the NDP also advances some frank recommendations in areas such as education, health and the public sector, as part of the creation of a nurturing and enabling environment for business to prosper. A set of integrated actions is being proposed to address the issue of inefficiency and other challenges related to public service delivery. To improve educational outcomes, the Plan directly confronts issues, such as teacher performance, appointment procedures and accountability. The challenges in public health management are also addressed and in building a capable state, detailed recommendations are made on professionalising the public service. Some areas of Government, where improvements have occurred, such as the South African Revenue 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Service through an improvement in operational procedures, management and delivery systems should be emulated by other organs of state. An initiative worth mentioning in terms of already improved processes in the public sector is the introduction of an e-portal on 1 April 2015 that will reshape the South African government supply chain processes, particularly as it relates to government tenders. It is envisaged that the public will eventually be able to see all tenders, bidders and their prices quoted, as well as minutes of bid committee meetings. Over and above the e-portal, a national database of all approved and compliant suppliers and an “online shop”, where government departments will place orders of less than R500 000, will be established. Initiatives such as these are laudable and will contribute towards increased efficiencies in service delivery which is essential for improved growth prospects. The focus within the NDP on the eradication of corruption from the system is most welcome, in taking cognisance of the fact that for state officials to act in a corrupt fashion, requires a willing counter party from the private sector is necessary. The introduction of the government’s new tender process, as already mentioned, will go a long way in exposing and limiting possible corruption within the system. The NDP recognises the need for increased fixed investment in the economy and has set a target of raising the level of gross fixed capital formation from around 20 per cent of GDP currently, to as high as 30 per cent by 2030. Inarguably, well-planned and appropriate infrastructural development is conducive to higher levels of economic growth and job creation. The NDP clearly distinguishes between investment that generates immediate financial returns, such as in airports and power stations and those projects where financial returns are far less measurable, such as in schools and hospitals. The role of business in increasing the overall level of fixed investment in the country will most appropriately lie in the area of fixed investment where financial returns are more evident, through public private partnerships. International experience has shown that private sector participation in infrastructure provision is most successful in the transport and energy sectors. The participation of the private sector contributes to effective cost containment through the profit motive, improves efficiency and leads to more sustainable jobs through more ambitious skills transfer initiatives. An area, in which the private sector can excel, given appropriate incentives, is that of research and development which could act as a driver of competitiveness and job creation. A number of large R&D projects have already shown feasibility and have the ability to develop into new industries, creating substantial opportunities for increased employment, foreign revenue income, beneficiation and competitiveness. Many infrastructure investment projects can act as an attractive asset class for private investors, due to the predictable nature of returns, thereby providing a low risk investment profile. Infrastructure investment projects may provide a means whereby a consistent real return over inflation can be attained through a low volatility investment vehicle. Private sector funding is, however, subject to policy certainty so that private investors can be assured that they will be able to realise a return on their investments. The NDP proposes that Regulatory Impact Assessments be done on all new regulations, and that an expert panel be appointed to prepare a comprehensive regulatory review for small- and medium-sized firms in an effort to assess whether special conditions are required for such entities. To this end, a new unit is being created in the Presidency to carry out thorough impact assessments of both new and existing legislation and regulations within a Social Economic Impact Assessment System that will ensure alignment with the NDP and reduce the risk of unintended consequences. The continued drive towards the establishment of a viable renewable energy sector in South Africa should be supported and is an example of an area in which small businesses could rapidly gain traction, as countries become more inclined to embrace a Green Growth development approach, as we enter the so-called Solar Age. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The proper implementation of the NDP will be conducive to an increased level of entrepreneurship in the economy, as the ease of doing business improves. The obvious outcome of such a process will be the creation of more sustainable jobs. Small businesses generally have the capacity to attract those who are low to moderately skilled and are, therefore, best placed to recruit from among the significant pool of unemployed workers.  The NDP is already facilitating the bringing together of various stakeholders in the economy within an environment of common purpose. The NDP thus constitutes a powerful and integrated development agenda for the state and the whole of South Africa, and for the Plan to succeed it should continuously be translated into action plans, with clear milestone along the way, within realistic time frames. To yield relatively swift results, in terms of improved growth, the following two focus areas deserve mentioning. The first is a better integration of the South African economy with that of Africa. This will indeed be beneficial through boosting interregional trade, investment and capital flows, and allow the domestic economy to tap into the more vibrant growth rates being experienced in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated that an effective integration with the sub-continent could add as much as 1,5 per cent to South Africa’s growth rate. Furthermore, South Africa should capitalise on its comparative advantages, related to physical, financial and telecommunication infrastructure to attract international firms with the aspiration to gain a foothold in Africa. A study, recently conducted by the World Bank, identified three areas of opportunity to improve this country’s export competitiveness, namely, boosting local competition by opening South African markets to domestic and foreign entry; promoting deeper regional integration in goods and services within Africa; and alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks. This brings us to the second factor which would meaningfully enhance South Africa’s growth potential, namely the forceful implementation of the R1 trillion infrastructure expenditure programme of government. Through multiplier effects, and in terms of job creation, especially with regard to the promotion of low-skilled jobs, economic growth can be materially enhanced. Several studies have shown that investment in economic infrastructure has the potential to act as one of the most effective policies in terms of promoting economic growth. Employment is created during the construction phase of such infrastructure projects, as well as during the operational life thereof. Moreover, the key driver of private sector investment is public sector investment as it inspires both business and consumer confidence. A combination of these two driving forces has the potential to easily boost South Africa’s growth to rates well in excess of current levels, putting this country on a higher road to economic prosperity, thus hopefully reducing unemployment levels, poverty levels and the degree of inequality. I further believe that it will positively contribute to further restore the dignity of our fellow South Africans. South Africans at times can tend to be fairly pessimistic. The challenges we face are immense, but not dissimilar in scale and extent to those faced not only by developing economies but also developed economies. I however choose to be optimistic and do believe that we have many factors that do count in our favour and am convinced that with the right policy choices we can go a long way towards successfully addressing the triple challenges of structural unemployment, poverty and inequality. I thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Generating more winners in microfinance Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the launch of the 2015 Citi Microentrepreneurship Awards, Manila, 22 May 2015. *      *      * Today we launch the 2015 Citi Microenterpreneurship Awards or CMA, a groundbreaking program that has allowed us to discover the creativity, tenacity and generosity of Filipino microentrepreneurs across our country. We just heard the testimony of Ms. Teresita Valdez, one of about a hundred CMA awardees so far. Their stories inspire, inform and motivate those who want to go into business. The challenges they faced and how they overcome seemingly insurmountable odds strengthen the resolve of other entrepreneurial Filipinos that they too can succeed in the microfinance sector. Indeed, our microentrepreneurs represent a gold mine of lessons and information that has been helping us transform and improve the lives of millions of Filipinos through microfinance. Ladies and gentlemen. A significant factor in our growing harvest of successful microenterprises stories is a regulatory environment that enables microfinance institutions or MFIs to provide appropriate products and services. Microentrepreneurs succeed when the regulatory framework is well-defined; enables various MFIs – whether banks, coops and NGOs – to deliver a range of microfinance services to their niche markets; and encourages institutions under our supervision to cater to microentrepreneurs, a market which “traditional” bankers tend to sidestep due to perceived high credit risks and transaction costs. In this connection, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has issued clear guidelines and codes of conduct, so that banks can viably provide an array of products designed to fit the peculiarities of microfinance clients. I can say we are on the right track. The Philippine regulatory framework for microfinance has been consistently ranked as one of the best in world by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). More recently, the EIU ranked the Philippines as the top country in Asia, and the 3rd in the world, with the most conducive environment for financial inclusion. The EIU further notes that countries like the Philippines with a long tradition of microfinance have better institutional and financial infrastructures – which can be leveraged to financially-include more clients at the “bottom of the pyramid”. Back in 2000 when the BSP started issuing microfinance-related regulations, hardly any bank was into microfinance. Today, we have 176 thrift and rural banks serving over 1.2 million microfinance clients with outstanding loans of PhP 11.4 billion – or an average of nine thousand five hundred pesos. These microfinance loans now include different types – for starting and growing microenterprises; for micro-agriculture ventures; and for housing. These are all designed for low-income households with varied financing needs. At the same time, microfinance banks have opened 2 million microdeposit accounts with nearly four billion pesos in deposits. In addition, 39 banks licensed as microinsurance agents are now serving 1.4 million clients. Big banks, on the other hand, are participating in the microfinance market by providing wholesale loans to retail MFIs or to MSMEs through their subsidiaries. I am also pleased to report the progress being made by other MFIs outside the BSP’s supervision in moving the industry forward. Among others, a survey indicated that 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  16 microfinance NGOs with a combined network of 2,190 branches have P11.6 billion in outstanding loans served to 2.5 million borrowers – or an average of P4,640.00 per borrower. On the other hand, data from the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) indicate that 67.9 percent of the 10,675 reporting coops are providing financial services to 6.5 million members. It is clear: there is great potential for MFIs to accelerate the development of microfinance with appropriate, effective and responsive services. We have been monitoring this. Among others, 35 banks have set up 517 micro-banking offices (MBOs) in 334 municipalities; 64 of these municipalities are served only by an MBO. BSP regulations issued in 2010 enabled the creation of MBOs – these are small banking units where microfinance clients can conveniently access a range of banking services, including loans, microdeposits and microinsurance. The e-money regulations issued by the BSP in 2009 have also produced positive results: 52 microfinance oriented banks now provide e-banking and e-money services. They see the value of e-money as a transactional platform for faster, cost-efficient and convenient transfer of funds. Among others, e-money can be used by microfinance clients to purchase goods, pay bills or loans, and move value to their deposit accounts. Indeed, the e-money ecosystem offers opportunities for MFIs as our regulatory framework allows banks and non-banks – such as telco subsidiaries and e-money agents – to participate as issuers or delivery channels. Today, this ecosystem consists of more than 24,000 agents which complement over 10,000 banking offices and over 15,000 ATMs as financial service access points. MFIs can tap into this infrastructure, in response to clients’ need for easier access and other convenient functions. Please note that the number of e-money accounts opened over a period of five years has reached 26.7 million. This represents exponential growth compared with the 47.4 million deposit accounts that took our banks 100 years to generate. While e-money accounts are just transactional accounts, it can be the first step or an “on-ramp” to more valuable financial services such as savings, credit, even microinsurance. It is a fact –  MFIs that keep finding ways to serve clients thru efficient, sustainable business models can help nurture more successful microentrepreneurs. Strong support from public and private sector partners can provide more impetus to grow more success stories in the microfinance sector. One prime example is CMA itself, made possible by mutual support and collective diligence of the Microfinance Council of the Philippines, Inc. (MCPI), Citibank, Citi Foundation, and the BSP itself. At the same time, the participation of distinguished members of the CMA National Selection Committee provides prestige and valuable linkages that generate long-term benefits for CMA winners. Let’s give them a big hand. Networks such as bank associations and cooperative federations also play unique roles in providing support to their MFI members. The role of media is also important – you raise public awareness of microfinance, prompt discussions about its promise and opportunities, and even make microfinance a “trending” topic. Ladies and gentlemen, let us keep in mind that with appropriate enabling regulations, responsive MFI services, and multi-sectoral support for microentrepreneurs, we can help improve the lives of millions of Filipinos. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Through our collective efforts, we can help inspire more microentrepreneurs, generate more success stories from their ranks, and realize our goal of achieving balanced and sustained growth that is truly inclusive. Thank you all for joining today’s launch of the 2015 CMA. Mabuhay ang microfinance sector! Mabuhay ang ating mahal na bansang Pilipinas! Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Daniel Mminele: The globalised nature of central banking Address by Mr Daniel Mminele, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the INSEAD Alumni Association Dialogue, Pretoria, 28 May 2015. *      *      * Introduction Good evening, and welcome to the South African Reserve Bank. INSEAD is internationally recognised for excellence in business education. It is not only one of the largest business schools in the world; INSEAD also has a strong tradition of promoting diversity, with close on 90 different nationalities being represented in each annual intake. I gather that the South African Alumni Association has 580 members who have attended both MBA and executive level courses at INSEAD. It is a pleasure to host and participate in this Dialogue with you this evening, particularly in light of the fact that many of you are in senior and executive positions in large companies and hence are important stakeholders in addressing the challenges confronting our country today.  The world has become increasingly globalised. This is clearly evident in economic indicators on capital movements and foreign direct investments, international trade, technology transfers, and the expansion of cross-border activity of multinational firms. Thus, global considerations are always on the radar screen of policymakers, especially those in small open economies like South Africa. In the case of monetary policy, factors such as oil price developments, capital flows, global inflation trends, and exchange-rate developments are some of the considerations that have a bearing on policy stance determination. However, knowing that many of you would have read our MPC statement of last week, my remarks today will not focus on policy, at least not directly. I would rather like to use this opportunity to talk about the globalised nature of central banking. In essence, my remarks will focus on how the financial crisis of 2007/08 as well as the role of international forums (such as the G-20, the International Monetary Fund, and BRICS) in responding to the crisis, have impacted on the work of central banks. This will also provide the opportunity for me to share with you the involvement of the South African Reserve Bank in these international forums, which complements the interest-rate setting mandate of the Bank. Monetary policy before and after the crisis Much has been written about how globalisation might impact on the work of central banks and whether it weakens the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy.  Some have argued that globalisation does indeed dilute monetary policy’s effectiveness through its impact on the structure and functioning of markets, while it also pitches global factors as more prominent drivers of domestic outcomes. Others have pointed to the benefits emanating from risk-sharing and reduced volatility in financial markets, as globalisation, helps to increase liquidity in financial markets, for example. As with everything, one could argue equally for both sides on the costs and benefits of globalisation, but, needless to say, impacts will differ across countries and regions depending on, among others, the level of development of their financial markets, the openness of their economies, and the credibility of their monetary and fiscal authorities. Of importance for a policymaker is understanding the influences and risks associated with globalisation and ensuring that the risks are adequately accounted for in policy formulation and implementation. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Lucas Papademos, a former Vice-President of the European Central Bank, has argued that globalisation in general does not fundamentally undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy in preserving price stability. He has acknowledged the positive effects of financial globalisation on the efficiency of financial markets, on global risk-sharing and, ultimately, on economic growth worldwide, but he has also admitted that the global financial crisis revealed a number of weaknesses in the globalised financial system, where tensions in one segment of the market in one country can rapidly spread across other markets and countries.1 The global financial crisis certainly elevated the subject of globalisation and its impact on the world of central banking. We now have first-hand knowledge of how financial globalisation in particular can alter the monetary policy landscape and influence the nature and magnitude of spillovers and spillbacks. Certainly, the world of central banking has undergone dramatic changes since 2007: unprecedented reductions in policy rates to the zero lower bound and beyond, and the utilisation of balance-sheet policies in non-traditional ways, which have become the norm in some advanced economies. These actions had repercussions for financial markets through increased capital flows, among others, with emerging markets bearing the brunt of these developments. We are now being reminded that emerging markets should prepare themselves for the possibility of further market dislocations given the prevailing environment of divergent policy settings, with the Fed and the UK on paths of monetary policy tightening while the euro area and Japan are likely to maintain a loose policy stance for the immediate future. Besides influencing monetary policy, the crisis also revealed that central banks could no longer see themselves purely as overseers of monetary policy but that this mandate had to be broadened to explicitly include financial stability. As the Bank for International Settlements has put it, “the global financial crisis has shaken the foundations of the deceptively comfortable pre-crisis central banking world”.2 The conventional wisdom which held prior to the crisis has proved inadequate. It is now generally accepted that price stability alone is insufficient for macroeconomic stability. In addition, we now know that there is no neat separation between monetary and financial stability functions, and that if each central bank looks after its own economy, this does not automatically lead to an appropriate global monetary stance. Further, interest-rate policy alone is not enough. The regulation and supervision of financial institutions needs to go beyond a microprudential perspective towards a macroprudential orientation, with central banks playing a key role in this process. It was the financial crisis which brought to the fore the need for greater global cooperation, not only among advanced economies but also in emerging-market economies who would prove to be the drivers of global growth during the crisis. It was for this reason that the prominence of the G-20 was raised to that of a Leaders’ Summit in 2009. There was clear recognition that there needed to be greater inclusivity to effectively mitigate the damage of the financial crisis, which had clearly highlighted the vulnerability and the interlinkages of the global financial system. The international response Let me now turn to the work undertaken by the international forums in which the Bank is an active participant (including the G-20, BRICS, and the Bank for International Settlements),                                                 1 Globalisation and central bank policies, a speech by Lucas Papademos at the Bridge Forum Dialogue, 22 January 2008. 2 BIS Working Papers No. 353, Central banking post-crisis: what compass for uncharted waters? by Claudio Borio. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  with the objective of ensuring that outcomes reached are in the best interest of not only the global economy but also emerging markets, South Africa, and the region. Since the onset of the crisis, the G-20 assumed a leading role in trying to address the consequences thereof in an effort to reduce the negative repercussions for the global economy. This entailed, inter alia, the G-20 taking the lead in addressing the shortcomings of the global financial system, enhancing financial safety nets, and, together with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, ensuring a more sound and stable financial and regulatory framework. The G-20 played a prominent role in shaping the elements of the work programme of the International Monetary Fund, or the IMF. Let me highlight some of the initiatives that the IMF undertook in response to requests from the G-20. Firstly, the IMF’s lending capacity was boosted to ensure that it would comfortably meet the ever-increasing financing needs of countries hit by the global financial crisis, thereby strengthening global economic and financial stability. The G-20 agreed in April 2009 to increase the borrowed resources available to the IMF by up to US$750 billion, tripling the total pre-crisis lending resources of about US$250 billion. In April 2010, the IMF Executive Board adopted a proposal on an expanded and more flexible New Arrangements to Borrow, or NAB, under which the NAB grew to approximately US$560 billion. This included 13 new participating countries and institutions, including a number of emerging-market countries that made significant contributions to this large expansion. In April 2012, the International Monetary and Financial Committee3 (IMFC) and the G-20 Finance Ministers and Governors jointly agreed to further enhance the IMF’s resources through a new round of bilateral borrowing. This round included 35 agreements totalling US$385 billion. South Africa participated in all these initiatives and contributed US$2 billion to the 2012 initiative. The IMF, together with the G-20, revamped its lending framework to provide greater emphasis on crisis prevention tools. For example, the Flexible Credit Line was introduced in April 2009 and enhanced in August 2010 as a lending tool and form of insurance for countries with very strong fundamentals; qualified countries can have upfront, large access to IMF resources, with no ongoing conditions given the strength of their policy frameworks. The Precautionary and Liquidity Line was also designed to meet the liquidity needs of member countries with sound economic fundamentals but with some remaining vulnerabilities. In an attempt to strengthen its credibility and legitimacy, the IMF undertook to reform its governance structure and, in April 2008 and November 2010, agreed on wide-ranging governance reforms to reflect the increasing importance of emerging-market countries. However, the latter reforms have unfortunately not been implemented yet and continue to await ratification by the US. Nonetheless, the 14th General Review of Quotas will double the IMF’s permanent resources to US$656 billion. In recent years, the IMF has undertaken major initiatives to strengthen surveillance to respond to a more globalised and interconnected world. These initiatives include revamping the legal framework for surveillance to cover spillovers, a greater analysis of risks and financial systems, stepping up assessments of members’ external positions, and responding more promptly to concerns of member countries. All these changes were introduced with input from the G-20, and South Africa, as a member of the G-20, actively participated in these discussions and decisions.                                                 3 The IMF Board of Governors is advised by two ministerial committees: the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) and the Development Committee. The IMFC has 24 members, drawn from the pool of 187 governors of the IMF. The IMFC discusses matters of common concern affecting the global economy and advises the IMF on the direction of its work. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In the area of financial regulation, the G-20 has worked closely with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and other standard-setting bodies to agree on and implement key regulatory reforms, including ensuring resilient financial institutions, ending the “too-big-to-fail” approach, addressing shadow-banking risks, and making over-the-counter derivative markets safer. Basel III was endorsed by the G-20 in November 2010. The task of developing new standards was complex and time-consuming, requiring cross-border cooperation to ensure consistency on a multitude of issues between central banks, ministries of finance, regulators and supervisors, international organisations, and financial standard-setting bodies. While the Basle III rules have been agreed upon, the next phase of a timely, full, and consistent implementation is just as important to ensure level playing fields between jurisdictions and financial institutions and to address any unintended consequences of the reforms. Due to the globalised nature of the financial system, it will be important to continue analysing the effects of individual jurisdictions’ policies on each other to understand the positive and negative spillovers.  The participation of the South African Reserve Bank The Bank has a particular role to play in ensuring the stability and resilience of South African financial institutions and markets, thus contributing to and promoting globally stable financial systems. The Bank fulfils this responsibility on an international, regional, and domestic level. Similarly to many other jurisdictions, South Africa is also reforming its domestic financial regulatory architecture and arrangements. In addition to regulating and supervising the banking sector and overseeing the national payment system, under the proposed Twin Peaks model of regulation the Bank will also be responsible for the prudential regulation of the insurance sector and other types of financial market infrastructures, and will fulfil the function of the resolution authority. While the Bank readies itself to take on more regulatory responsibilities on the insurance side, South Africa, through its current supervisor, the Financial Services Board, is already a respected partner in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, having been one of the seven co-founders in 1994. Financial regulatory standard-setting bodies such as the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have expanded their governance structures to be more representative and to reflect the globalised nature of the financial system. This includes considering the particular role of central banks as direct financial supervisory authorities, or where they act in an advisory role to their governments. As mentioned earlier, the Bank is actively engaged in the activities of international financial standard-setting bodies as well as the activities of the G-20 forum and the IMF. To name but two examples, in 2009 the Bank formally joined the membership of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (formerly known as the CPSS: the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems). Through National Treasury, South Africa has been a plenary member of the Financial Stability Board since 2010, and in early 2015 was allocated a second seat along with five other emerging-market countries at the plenary table. The Bank has assumed the position of an additional plenary member and, together with National Treasury, can use this opportunity to influence the agenda to focus on issues that especially affect emerging markets. It should, however, be clear that even before the Bank formally became a member of the above-mentioned bodies, it continuously followed and, where appropriate, aligned its own policies and procedures with the guidance and principles issued by these international standard-setting bodies. South Africa’s membership of these international standard-setting bodies is accompanied with the requirement that we comply with the standards developed by these bodies. This compliance process includes annual IMF Article IV consultations, IMF / World Bank Financial System Stability Assessments (FSSAs) and Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs), peer reviews by other G-20 member countries on our Framework for Economic Growth, Financial Stability Board country peer reviews, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision process to determine the adoption of Basel III capital and liquidity 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  standards for banks through the Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP). The Financial Stability Board released its review on South Africa in 2013, the IMF completed an FSSA and three ROSCs in 2014, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has almost completed its RCAP on capital and liquidity compliance. In the G-20 forum, there is much discussion, analysis, and sharing of views on monetary policy spillovers, particularly in the current environment of increasingly divergent monetary policies by some of the advanced countries. Other topics that have received attention within the G-20 context have included oil price developments, investment spending, and tax reforms. These issues are discussed at ministerial and governor level, and these discussions certainly help in creating greater awareness of policy actions and a better understanding of the spillover and spillback effects that countries could be subjected to. The overarching focus of discussion at the G-20 more recently has been how individual member countries can devise growth strategies which would contribute to the objective of increasing global growth by an additional 2 per cent over the next five years. These strategies are continuously evaluated to ensure that they remain applicable and implementable, and they are also peer-reviewed to ensure that countries adhere to their commitments. In addition to our involvement in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Governor attends the bimonthly meetings of the Bank for International Settlements, which provides a forum for governors and senior officials to share country experiences and to discuss the outlook for the global economy and financial markets. The Bank also participates in the Meeting of Governors from major emerging-market economies. In today’s interconnected world, having such a forum to discuss issues and challenges specific to emerging-market economies is extremely valuable. Furthermore, in many instances, the Bank is the only representative from the continent and is thus able to provide an African perspective on some of the economic challenges confronting the global economy.  The Bank’s interactions are not limited to international bodies but include regional bodies and less formal but equally important engagements, such as with home- and host-country supervisors through supervisory colleges and crisis management groups. To promote regional financial integration, the Bank is fully supportive of and active on committees such as the Association of African Central Banks, the SADC Committee for Central Bank Governors (CCBG), the Community of African Banking Supervisors (CABS), and the Financial Stability Board’s Regional Consultative Group for sub-Saharan Africa. The work of these important committees contributes towards the development and implementation of an effective financial sector regulatory framework in Africa, and promotes growth and development on the continent. Being in the privileged position of participating in the development of international standards and principles brings with it certain responsibilities. Those who participate in international and regional financial standard-setting bodies have the obligation to play a proactive role, to use our strengthened voice, to be ready to take constructive positions on the various reforms, and to consider the views of those countries who do not sit at the table. The Bank is fully committed to fulfilling this responsibility in all its engagements. As you are aware, South Africa is also part of the BRICS grouping of countries. We meet ahead of G-20 meetings to exchange views on issues affecting the global economy. In addition, these countries have committed themselves to supporting one another and undertaking collaborative initiatives that will benefit BRICS as a group. In this regard, BRICS has agreed to the establishment of the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), which BRICS leaders agreed to in July 2014. The CRA is a self-managed arrangement, the purpose of which is to serve as a financial safety net, complementing existing international monetary and financial arrangements. The initial size of the CRA is US$100 billion; South Africa contributes US$5 billion and is eligible to receive US$10 billion in support. The CRA is made up of swap arrangements between the BRICS countries and will be used to forestall short-term balance-of-payments pressures, provide mutual support, and strengthen financial 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  stability. The CRA is beneficial to South Africa as it adds a layer of financial support in times of crises. Currently, the BRICS central banks are negotiating the Inter Central Bank Agreement which operationalises the CRA; this is set to be finalised before the next BRICS Summit in Russia in July 2015. Conclusion The recent crisis has highlighted the importance of effective cooperation and coordination by central banks as well as the benefits of improved information-sharing between financial supervisors and central banks. The experiences of the past few years have highlighted the need to deepen our understanding of how globalisation affects both monetary policy and financial stability. This, in turn, facilitates a better assessment of the potential systemic implications of financial shocks, which should assist policymakers in addressing market tensions faced by individual institutions. Through forums such as the G-20, the IMF, and BRICS, much work has been undertaken to strengthen the global economy and the global financial system, and to better identify, understand, and manage risks.  South Africa and the Bank, as an active participant in these international forums, always strive to ensure that the interests of the country and of the continent are represented in discussions on the global economy. Allow me, in closing, to leave you with a plea. You have all been privileged to attend one of the world’s leading business schools and have come back equipped to assume the important roles you occupy in your respective companies. With the release of the most recent unemployment figures earlier this week, which in no small measure have to do with education and skills levels, I would encourage you, if you are not already doing so, to get involved in coaching and mentorship programmes to share your insights, expertise, and experiences. We celebrated Africa Day on Monday. With the vast potential and opportunities that our continent offers, which need good business leadership to partner with governments and the public sector, would it not be nice to add, somewhere in the near future, an African INSEAD campus to the locations in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East? Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Erkki Liikanen: Major structural change in the Finnish economy Speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the 70th anniversary of Oras (a Finnish company), Helsinki, 7 May 2015. *      *      * 1949s and 1950s After the Second World War the Finnish economy and society was in front of huge challenges: 10 % of the population had to be relocated from Karelia which we lost to Soviet Union. The war reparations paid to Soviet Union in 1945–1951 accounted for 2–6 % of the GDP annually. In the first post-war years, the reparation costs constituted almost a quarter of all government expenditure. Still, Finns had a lot of confidence on the future. The most striking example was the baby boom. Over 100 000 babies were born in 1945–1949 and still in 1950 close to 100 000. The baby boom had a deep impact on the society and economy then and still has. The high birth rate further boosted the need for new homes. In addition to residential construction, also public construction was booming, as new schools were needed. Encouraged by the favorable domestic demand conditions, new entrepreneurs entered the market during the years of the baby boom. Erkki Paasikivi was one of them and in 1945 founded Oras in Rauma. The Finnish economy was growing rapidly also in the 1950s .But the export-led growth was more volatile reflecting the international business cycle. The Korean boom in 1950 and 1951 and recession in 1952 had a deep impact on the forest industry and its supply chain. Oras instead grew from 15 employees in 1950 to 20 in 1952. It was still a small company, but it already went actively abroad and especially to Germany to get the best available technologies. A fundamental problem for Finland at the time was the choice between savings and consumption. To improve long-term growth prospects, more investment was needed. The new investment were mainly funded by domestic savings by postponing consumption. Many Finnish people seemed to be more interested to improve their standard of living here and now. Obviously Erkki Paasikivi realized early the importance of postponing consumption. The profits from their business was retained in the company and invested for growth. Investments in R&D were made and productivity was improved. 1960s and 1970s Major structural changes in the Finnish economy accelerated in the 1960s and early 1970s. Finland transformed from an economy dominated by agriculture to an industrial country. Migration from countryside to cities increased, as the baby boomers were entering the labor markets. As many as 30 000 new homes were built every year in the 1960s. A third of them were government subsidized ARAVA homes. People all over the country were building their own houses. Living standards of the Finnish people were growing rapidly. One sign were modern bath rooms and saunas with showers built in the new homes. My family was a typical case. I was in a primary school, when my parents built our own Arava house in Mikkeli in 1959. We got the running water and sewerage only in 1963. Then came the first products from Rauma into our home in Mikkeli. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The world economy grew steadily in the 1960s and still in early 1970s. Finland had already joined the IMF and World Bank in 1948, and GATT in 1949. In 1961 Finland was accepted as an associate member in EFTA. Thus Finland was able to guarantee that her industry had access to export markets equal with Sweden. So the Finnish economy was able to integrate with the Western world at the same time when the bilateral trade with the Soviet Union was important for our exports. Deeper integration to international trade not only helped Finnish companies to enter new export markets but also facilitated technological spillovers from abroad to help Finland in catching up the technology gap with the more advanced economies. International competition also posed new challenges for the Finnish economy, as low cost countries entered the markets for low-end products. Competing only or mainly with price would mean decreasing the wages and the living standards. The other option was to use more advanced technologies and to introduce products with higher quality. This was the policy Oras followed. 1980s In 1988, as a young minister of finance I visited Oras in Rauma for the first time. I learned a lot then and even more last weekend when I had a chance to read the new excellent history of the company written by Timo Herranen. Many investments were taking place at the time in Rauma and atmosphere was positive. Pekka Paasikivi was running the company during my visit. Jukka and Jari Paasikivi had also important responsibilities in the firm. What impressed me most in the factory? Actually, there were four things. The first was how complex a product a faucet actually was. And this was well before the ICT revolution. The second were the casual industrial relations in the factory at the time. There was a very low hierarchy. Thirdly, I remember, how big a role was given to design. I am happy to hear that Jorma Vennola, the designer whose style we all know, is here with us. And fourthly, an important focus of Oras was on internationalization. All in all, it was also important to learn that a family company can grow fast when it is growth- and innovation -oriented and profits are retained in the company to finance growth. Generally, the sentiment in Finland was gradually turning more international in the 1980s. The Finnish companies started to go international not only by establishing new sales units, also by making acquisitions to enlarge their market shares. A number of family-owned companies followed this path. Oras was among them. It was not possible to maintain the high pace of growth by a company mainly based in Finnish markets. They had to seek growth from abroad. Also the drivers for economic growth were changing in the 1980s: According to professor Matti Pohjola, up until the mid-seventies investment of physical capital was the main driver of productivity and growth in Finland. It was only from the end of 1970s onwards, when human capital, like investments in education and R&D started to dominate. One of the trends of the late 1970s and the early 1980s was that the baby boomers were increasingly entering the top positions in business and politics. In Oras, the new generation was also taking the lead, as Pekka Paasikivi was nominated as the new CEO of ORAS in 1979. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  1990s In summer 1990 I moved with my family moved to Brussels. When we arrived at Zaventem airport, we were welcome by Oras faucets in the toilets. Later I went to see a football match in Anderlecht. In the stadium we saw a small billboard of Oras: the red color and a faucet was easy to recognize. Later we understood that to win market shares was not as easy. When we left Brussels in 2004, the faucets were in the news. The cartel case on faucet market had just been opened. Oras was not part of the cartel of a number of European companies. They were severely fined by the European Commission a few years later. The domestic depression of the 1990s was deep in Finland. High interest rates and the later devaluations of markka hit many companies and bankruptcies went up. The collapse of trade with the Soviet Union had its important role. GDP fell steeply and unemployment grew fast. Unlike many other Finnish companies, Oras had not taken major risks in its foreign operations. So it avoided exchange rate losses but benefited from improved competitiveness. Trade to the Soviet Union had a smaller role for the company than for many others. So in the difficult conditions of depression, Oras did relatively well. The depression of the 1990 was deep but not very long. The pre-recession level of the GDP was reached in 1995, and the era of Nokia-Finland was about to start. Also the integration process of Finland with the Western Europe was completed, when Finland joined the European Union in 1995. The early 1990’s were a turning point not only to the ICT industry but to the Finnish economy as a whole. Up until the depression, the Finnish companies typically adapted more advanced technologies from abroad. In the early 1990s, this catching up process, was largely completed. Thus, instead of catching up the technological frontier, the Finnish manufacturers themselves had to push that frontier forward. In its own industry, Oras has been pushing that frontier forward in the 1990s and at the same time it came more and more international. After acquisitions the personnel grew above one thousand. 2000’s At the turn of the millennium, the growth paths of Oras and the Finnish population started to diverge. Whereas Finland started to grey, Oras continued to grow. And in a new way. Major investments were made in public companies while staying firmly as an industrial enterprise. Also brothers Pekka, Jukka and Jari Paasikivi reorganized their division of work. The baby boomers started to reach retirement age so that in the end of the decade, the working age population turned to gradual decline. New history of Oras gives also an interesting window to labor relations in different times. According to the history also the management says that it has made some misjudgments. Early retirement schemes were not successful, because a lot of silent senior knowledge left the company. Relations with the unions have mostly worked but there have also been occasional tensions between the employer and the trade union. In the 1970’s, one reason was internal political struggle within the union. I am happy to see here Keijo Huunonen and Esko Sillanpää whom I learned to know well also from the book. Recently the company has responded to the aging problem and the looming shortage of work force with its own way. Oras has created a program that aims to support the work ability and transfer of skills from senior workers to younger cohorts. Interesting and positive innovations, not always without problems. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Thus, in 2014, the average retirement age in Oras was over 63 years, which is two years more than the national average. The way forward? The global economic outlook is challenging. According to the IMF outlook from two weeks ago, the recovery of the world economy continues, but it is happening slowly. In the short term, the decline in the price of oil, along with the adjustment of exchange rates are boosting the recovery. The emerging economies grow slower this year than in the last year. Russia is falling and also Brazil has difficulties. China continues to grow, but not as fast as before. India is keeping the pace, because it is benefiting from lower oil prices and its population growth. USA grows, in spite of recent signs of softness. Euro area is improving, too. The lower oil prices and ECB’s monetary policy, along with the exchange rate movements, support growth. Also fiscal consolidation has proceeded and is not the same sort of drag in the future as before. The question today is: Will Finland be able to benefit from the recovery of euro area? We are facing four major challenges. 1. The economic crisis has hit us hard, but it is was not the financial crisis. Our banks and financial markets have continued to function properly. Instead, our economy has entered a phase of major structural change, due to the recent fall in the share of the ICT sector and the decreasing consumption of certain important categories of paper. 2. Finland has lost part of its competitiveness since 2007. Our unit labor costs have grown more than 10 % higher than those of our competitors. 3. Retirement of baby boomers means that our labor force is shrinking 0.5 % a year for still one decade ahead. 4. Due to the fall of the GDP, our public sector is bigger than our national economy can well finance in the medium and long term. And in addition to this, a geopolitical crisis has taken a toll of our growth. What can we do? What do we have to do? In June 2011 I invited with Timo Kalli, the chairman of the Parliamentary Supervisory Council two businessmen and a new M.P. who was a former businessman to Bank of Finland to discuss the economic situation. One of the businessmen was Jari Paasikivi from Oras, who is having its 70th anniversary today and the new M.P. was Juha Sipilä, who forming a new government today. The agenda has developed but not fundamentally changed. We have three major tasks. 1. We need to restore cost competitiveness of our economy. This is the pre-condition to create growth and jobs. Social partners. 2. We need to make structural reforms to promote growth and improve possibilities to create jobs. Here the new government needs to move fast with decisions and their implementation. 3. We need to consolidate our public finances. We cannot move a growing debt burden to our children and grand-children. Here we need a strong government and functioning relations between social partners. Today I want to congratulate Oras for its 70-year history. I want to extend my congratulations to all in the company, the employees, the management, and the owners. The success has required major efforts for a long time from all of them. Thank you! 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Haruhiko Kuroda: Japan’s economy and monetary policy Speech by Mr Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Osaka, 28 September 2015. *      *      * Introduction It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished gathering of business leaders in Kansai. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the Bank of Japan’s branches in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. Looking at the recent economic developments, the slowdown in emerging economies, particularly China, has led to the sluggishness in Japan’s exports and production. Financial markets globally were volatile against the background of the decline in Chinese stock prices. Meanwhile, on the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is about 0 percent, due mainly to the effects of the substantial decline in crude oil prices from 2014. Thus, somewhat stagnant developments have been noticeable since summer, but as I will explain, the fundamentals of Japan’s economy are sound and the underlying trend in inflation has been improving steadily. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE), which the Bank introduced in April 2013, has been exerting its intended effects toward overcoming deflation. Today, before exchanging views with you, I would like to explain the Bank’s view on the current situation of and outlook for economic activity and prices, as well as its monetary policy. I. Economic activity in Japan and abroad Current situation of and outlook for Japan’s economy Let me start by discussing the current situation of and outlook for Japan’s economic activity. Japan’s economy has continued to recover moderately with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating in both the corporate and household sectors, although exports and production are affected by the slowdown in emerging economies. That is, in the corporate sector, profits have marked a record high and firms’ fixed investment stance has been positive. In the household sector, wages have been growing – as seen in the rise in base pay for two consecutive years in a situation where the unemployment rate has declined to the level that can be regarded as almost corresponding to “full employment” – and private consumption has been resilient. The real GDP growth rate for the April-June quarter of 2015 was minus 0.3 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis, registering a negative figure for the first time in three quarters (Chart 1). This is due to weak exports affected mainly by the recent slowdown in emerging economies and to somewhat sluggish private consumption reflective of bad weather. Exports are likely to remain more or less flat for the time being, due to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies. After that, however, they are likely to increase moderately as emerging economies move out of their deceleration phase. On this basis, Japan’s economy is expected to continue recovering moderately, as the virtuous cycle from income to spending will continue to operate in both the corporate and household sectors. Now, I would like to touch on two points of note when observing Japan’s economic activity. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Robust domestic private demand First, domestic private demand has continued to be robust. In the corporate sector, Japanese firms have been improving their profitability considerably in the face of various adversities that have occurred since the global financial crisis. In addition, with the correction of the excessive appreciation of the yen and with the decline in crude oil prices since summer 2014, Japanese firms have been making record profits, exceeding the peak registered before the global financial crisis (Chart 2). Looking ahead, corporate profits are expected to remain at their high levels. Under this favorable earnings environment, firms’ fixed investment stance is positive. Leading indicators such as machinery orders and construction starts also suggest an increase in business fixed investment. Firms’ positive fixed investment stance could be confirmed by various survey results. According to the June Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), the business fixed investment plans of large manufacturing firms for fiscal 2015 marked their highest level for this time of the year since fiscal 2004, reflecting in part an increase in domestic investment as it appears that the yen is likely to remain weak, and those of small firms marked roughly the same level as the average since fiscal 2000, suggesting robustness. What is worth noting is that, as the excessive appreciation of the yen is corrected, Japanese firms – which had been prioritizing foreign investment – seem to be increasing their domestic investment. This is a big change. On the back of a marked improving trend in corporate profits and the effects of monetary easing, business fixed investment is projected to continue increasing moderately. Turning to the household sector, labor market conditions are tight as firms have maintained their positive stance in hiring. The unemployment rate, which was above 4 percent before the introduction of QQE, has declined and recently registered 3.3 percent, a low level last seen in 1997, accompanying increases in both the labor force participation rate and the number of employees (Chart 3). Given that there is always a mismatch to some extent between job openings and job applicants in the labor market, the unemployment rate cannot go down to 0 percent. Estimating based on the past relation between job openings and job applicants in Japan, the recent unemployment rate of 3.0–3.5 percent could be regarded as almost corresponding to “full employment.” As labor market conditions are tight, nominal wages have been increasing moderately, albeit with some fluctuations. In the annual labor-management wage negotiations this spring, many firms increased wages, including base pay, which was raised to a larger extent than last year (Chart 4). This development has even spread to small firms. Since the number of employees has been increasing and nominal wages per employee have risen, overall employee income has been increasing moderately. In terms of household spending, private consumption is somewhat sluggish recently, reflecting bad weather in the April-June quarter. Nevertheless, as the employment and income situation has continued with its steady improvement and consumer sentiment is on an improving trend, private consumption seems to have remained resilient on the whole. Looking ahead, with no consumption tax hikes this fiscal year – unlike last fiscal year – and crude oil prices declining on an annual basis, wage increases are expected to exceed price increases and thereby real wages are expected to rise. In this situation, private consumption is expected to be more resilient. Housing investment, the other component of household spending, having declined following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike, has picked up evidently since the turn of the year against the backdrop of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. The pick-up is likely to continue going forward. Exports and overseas economies Second, I would like to touch on exports and overseas economies. Exports had increased for three quarters in a row since the July-September quarter of 2014, but have recently been more or less flat, due mainly to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies (Chart 5). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  They are expected to remain more or less flat for the time being, but after that, they are likely to increase moderately, supported by the correction of the appreciation of the yen to date as emerging economies move out of their deceleration phase. Looking closely at the developments in overseas economies by region, the U.S. economy has continued to recover, underpinned by household spending. In the January-March quarter of 2015, economic growth decelerated significantly due to transitory factors such as the effects of the severe winter weather and the strikes at West Coast ports, but a clear rebound was observed in the April-June quarter, with high growth. Against the backdrop of the continued favorable employment and income situation, the growth momentum seems to be solid. The Federal Reserve’s tightening coming into sight also suggests improvement of the U.S. economy. The European economy saw continued growth of nine consecutive quarters and has continued to recover moderately. As the financial assistance to Greece is being implemented, global financial markets’ view on the situation has become positive. Going forward, as the effects of the depreciation of the euro and monetary easing permeate, the European economy will likely continue to recover moderately. While the advanced economies are growing steadily, the emerging economies are slowing. First, as for China, the recent substantial decline in stock prices has had a significant impact on global financial markets. This could be regarded as a correction of the excessive level in stock prices that had more than doubled during about the half-year prior to the decline. Nevertheless, the real economy has also seen somewhat of a slowdown recently. With the increase in income levels, the Chinese economy is experiencing a phase of a shift in its economic structure from one centered on manufacturers to one centered on the services sector, leading to a change from high growth to medium growth. The recent slowdown is considered to be the adjustments of excess investment in manufacturers in this phase. The fact that investment in regional economies has been weak as political, economic, and social structural reform is carried out seems to be another reason for the slowdown. Under this situation, the Chinese authorities have been providing a series of economic stimulus measures both on the fiscal and monetary fronts. With relatively large room for conducting policy measures both on the fiscal and monetary fronts, the Chinese economy is likely to follow a generally stable growth path, albeit at a somewhat reduced pace. Emerging economies other than China are also showing sluggishness, reflecting the spillover effects of adjustments in China and global weakness in IT-related demand. This sluggishness is likely to continue for some time, but as the positive effects of the growth in advanced economies spread, economic growth in those emerging economies is expected to gradually accelerate, with domestic demand picking up, supported by economic stimulus measures. As a main scenario, overseas economies, particularly advanced economies, are expected to continue to grow moderately, and emerging economies are likely to move out of the deceleration phase. On that basis, although Japan’s exports are expected to remain more or less flat for the time being, they are likely to increase moderately thereafter. Needless to say, due attention needs to be paid to risk factors including developments in the emerging economies and in the global financial markets. II. Japan’s price developments I will next talk about Japan’s price developments. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) increased from minus 0.5 percent just before the introduction of QQE to 1.5 percent in April 2014, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike. However, as somewhat weak developments in private consumption continued after the consumption tax hike and crude oil prices declined substantially from summer last year, annual CPI inflation declined and has been about 0 percent since the turn of the year (Chart 6). The absence of an acceleration in headline CPI inflation can be attributed to the negative contribution of energy prices. Because of this negative effect, the year-on-year rate of 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  increase in the CPI has been pushed down by about 1 percentage point in recent months. Needless to say, unless crude oil prices continue to decline, the negative contribution of energy prices to the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI eventually will dissipate. Simple arithmetic shows that the negative contribution of energy prices falling off alone will push up the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI by about 1 percentage point compared with the current level. In addition, although the effects of the decline in energy prices have made it hard to discern, the underlying trend in inflation has steadily improved. For example, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy has been positive for 23 consecutive months since October 2013, and has increased to 1.1 percent according to the latest figure in August. Behind such steady improvement in the underlying trend in inflation is that firms’ and households’ views on prices have changed. The changes in firms’ and households’ views on prices have been revealed in their wage- and price-setting behavior. To begin with, in the spring wage negotiations between workers and management last year, base pay was increased for the first time in two decades. In this year’s negotiations, base pay was raised for the second year in a row, and at many firms the increases were larger than last year (Chart 4). Base pay increases were achieved at more firms than last year and became widespread across industries and firms of different size. As for price setting, an increasing number of firms seem to be able to pass increased costs, including the rise in input prices and personnel expenses, on to sales prices. In addition, it seems that households have started to accept such sales price increases on the back of an increase or prospects for an increase in their wages. There is a variety of evidence that firms’ price-hiking behavior has become widespread and sustained since the start of this fiscal year. For example, looking at the items that make up the CPI (all items less fresh food), the share of items for which prices rose minus the share of items for which prices fell has risen markedly since the beginning of this fiscal year and recently has reached the highest level since 2000 (Chart 7). In addition, price indices compiled by the University of Tokyo and Hitotsubashi University by aggregating the prices of food and daily necessities also show clear price increases since April this year on a year-on-year basis, and the increases seem to be accelerating. Many firms attempted to raise their sales prices at the beginning of last fiscal year, but this coincided with the consumption tax hike, which was followed by a decline in demand. Firms therefore were forced to quickly take price rises back. The price changes this year present a clear contrast with those last year. The simultaneous occurrence of base pay increases and price hikes should be regarded as evidence that a positive feedback loop between the increases in employment and wages and the moderate rise in inflation is now in place. Given these developments, although annual CPI inflation is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, with the underlying trend in inflation steadily rising and the negative contribution of the crude oil price decline dissipating, annual CPI inflation will accelerate toward the price stability target of 2 percent. The timing of reaching around 2 percent is projected to be around the first half of fiscal 2016, but it should be noted that the timing could be either earlier or later than the projection, depending on developments in crude oil prices. III. Monetary policy going forward The Bank has been pursuing QQE, aiming to achieve a state in which the 2 percent inflation rate is maintained in a stable manner. The observed inflation rate could move, reflecting various temporary factors; thus, in order to achieve 2 percent in a stable manner, the underlying trend in inflation is important. As I described earlier, the trend has been improving steadily. However, the positive feedback loop between the increases in employment and wages and the rise in inflation should gain further momentum in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices. The Bank maintains its policy stance that, when there are changes in trend inflation due to manifestation of risk factors, it will make adjustments without hesitation if judged as necessary to achieve the price stability target at the earliest possible time. Concluding remarks Lastly, I would like to touch on the point that I believe is most important to ensuring that a virtuous cycle of the Japanese economy will continue to work. Now firms are enjoying record profits and the labor market is in a full-employment condition. In light of the mechanism of the economy, this naturally would lead to decent economic growth and to moderate increases in wages and prices, a view that I also share. At the same time, it is also true that the pace of increase in fixed investment and wages is lackluster in light of record profits. This is perhaps because deflation has been protracted in Japan and it takes time to change the deflationary mindset of firms and households. With this in mind, the Bank will continue to strongly commit itself to overcoming deflation and to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. As I have explained on several occasions, in a situation where the 2 percent target is achieved in a stable manner, the current low interest rate environment would not last and the labor shortage would be more acute. Those who act early to move forward to secure opportunities in the future by utilizing profits currently at hand will be rewarded, and I am sure some of you have already started to act. The mechanism of the economy will surely prevail, and the Bank will definitely and decisively play its role. I will conclude my remarks by making this promise. Thank you.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Erkki Liikanen: The role of analysis in macroprudential policy Speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the RiskLab/BoF/ESRB Conference on Systemic Risk Analytics, Helsinki, 24 September 2015. *      *      * Original presentation is on the Bank of Finland’s website: Slides (PDF). 1. Systemic risks – learning the hard way [Slide 1] [Slide 2] The concept of systemic risks has received much more weight after the global financial crisis. Before the crisis, the term was mainly used within the Financial Stability Departments of central banks and among a limited number of banking and finance researchers. The concept was mainly used in microeconomic models of banking, and was almost non-existent in macroeconomic models. As a result, a structured dialogue between the two modelling worlds in this respect was largely missing. This was also reflected in policy discussions. Before the crisis, there were justified concerns about potential risks related to some micro level phenomena – such as securitization and credit risk transfer – and macro level phenomena – such as current account imbalances. However, an analysis combining these potentially interrelated phenomena in a unified framework was missing. Moreover, in banks’ risk management models and new regulatory models that mimic them (the Basel II framework, in particular) the prevailing paradigm was based on the assumptions of market efficiency and complete markets. These models were not sufficiently informed by economics of asymmetric information and incomplete markets. As a consequence of these and other shortcomings, many severe incentive problems which can undermine market efficiency and may help fuel bubbles were not taken seriously enough. Partly as a result of that, the global financial crisis took almost all researchers, financial institutions and policy-makers by surprise. Complex world [Slide 3] How can we improve our understanding of the risks and vulnerabilities that cause financial crises? One of the key tasks is to better incorporate systemic risks in economic models. Unfortunately, an inconvenient fact is that modelling systemic risks that reflect complexity of the real world does not make models any simpler. This is because systemic risks are not linear by nature. For example, if private sector debt relative to GDP increases substantially but still remains below its trend, systemic risk may not increase much. But if the ratio keeps rising above its trend level, systemic risk might shoot up at some point.1                                                 1  Cf., e.g., Jokivuolle, E., J. Pesola, and M. Virén (2015): Why is credit-to-GDP a good measure for setting countercyclical capital buffers? Journal of Financial Stability 18, June 2015, pp. 117–126. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The shooting up of systemic risk in this example happens when the vulnerability of firms and households to external shocks enters a critical zone. As debts grow, more and more firms and households would experience financial distress if the economy turns down. Financial distress may feed back negatively to the economy if consumption and investment are reduced. At worst, firm and household defaults cause substantial losses to financiers, especially banks. If banks have also had too little capital and too much debt, especially short-term debt, banks may not be able to absorb the losses without cutting back their lending. This adds a further and potentially dangerous negative feedback to the economy. Macroeconomic models are now taking steps to incorporate such effects. But more work needs to be done. Another source of complexity in the real world are the networks of banks and banks´ bilateral exposures. The network and contagion effects are difficult to analyze due, inter alia, to imperfect information about counterparty balance sheets.2 After the crisis, more attention has been paid on the network analysis. I am certain that the presentations of this Conference related to networks and contagion will give us many new insights. Complex risks – complex rules? [Slide 4] If systemic risks are complex, does this imply that we need complex regulatory rules to combat them? Not necessarily. While economic models missed some important complexities of the real world prior to the crisis, the regulation of finance, particularly banks’ risk-based capital requirements, had grown perhaps too complex. Complex regulation together with its heterogeneous implementation left financial institutions with plenty of room for regulatory arbitrage and even manipulation of their regulatory and accounting information. This is somewhat ironic, because the increasing complexity of regulation was largely motivated by the need to reduce incentive problems which were created by the “flat”, non-risk-based capital requirements of the earlier (Basel I) framework. After the crisis, simpler and more robust regulatory rules have been developed to back up the more complex rules. The forthcoming leverage ratio requirement and the Basel Committee´s proposals for the new simple capital floors for banks´ internal risk-based capital requirements are examples of that approach. Such safeguards provide protection against collective model risks, such as the mismeasurement of subprime mortgage risks which turned into a systemic problem. II. Macroprudential analysis: a policy-maker’s view [Slide 5] Economic research has a key role in the design of better regulation. Research can inform regulators in their search for the right balance between robustness and sophistication of regulatory rules. We also need high quality cost-benefit and impact analyses of regulation in order to assess the effects of regulation on financial institutions and markets, and, ultimately, on the real economy.                                                 2  A recent example of the use of network analysis is Toivanen, M. (2015): Essays on Credit Contagion and Shocks in Banking. Doctoral dissertation, University of Vaasa. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In addition to the traditional financial regulatory rules we should think of safeguarding financial stability with macroprudential policy more generally. In this more holistic approach the role of analysis and research is, if possible, even more important than in the design of the traditional microprudential regulatory rules. When talking about macroprudential policy, some observers have yet found it useful to make a distinction between it and regulation. Paul Tucker, for instance, defines macroprudential policy as “dynamically adjusted financial regulation”. Given that definition, one could argue that a well-designed and stringently implemented financial regulation is the first line of defense against systemic risks. Macroprudential policy – that is, the dynamic adjustment of regulation – is the important second line of defense.3 High-quality analysis reduces the inaction bias [Slide 6] Most economists and policy-makers seem to agree that the key objective of the macroprudential policy is to provide additional resilience to financial institutions and the financial system against cyclical and structural systemic risks and vulnerabilities. But that is not sufficient. We also need macroprudential policies that can effectively restrain an excessive build-up of leverage and growth in household and corporate borrowing and thus dampen the credit and financial cycles. In the euro area, this need is particularly acute, as the economic cycles are currently diverging across countries and as the key monetary policy rates will stay low for a prolonged period of time. To prevent or at least dampen potentially destructive financial booms, the authorities must be able to take early macroprudential actions. To do that, the role of reliable early warning indicators is critical. I welcome the strong emphasis of this Conference on early warning indicators and models. The most effective tools for dampening credit cycles seem to be the so-called borrower-based instruments, such as caps on borrowers´ loan-to-value (LTV), loan-to-income (LTI) and debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratios. Fixed caps on these ratios, applied in many countries, are certainly useful. But ideally, the macroprudential authorities should have powers to adjust these ratios, if necessary, in a counter-cyclical fashion. Of course, that will be challenging: a discretionary use of borrower-based instruments is politically highly sensitive, which may lead to an inaction bias. High-quality analysis and research can help the policy-maker to overcome this bias: politically sensitive decisions can only be based on sound indicator- and model-based macroprudential analysis. The more confident the policy-makers are on the quality of analyses, the easier it is for them to decide (i) when to deploy macroprudential tools, (ii) which tools to use and (ii) how to calibrate them. High-quality analysis and research will also help policy-makers to assess the impact of different macroprudential measures on lending, asset prices and economic activity.                                                 3  For a similar view, see e.g. Blanchard (2015) Ten takeaways from the “Rethinking Macro Policy: Progress or Confusion?” http://www.voxeu.org/article/rethinking-macroeconomic-policy-introduction. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Macroprudential policies in the euro area [Slide 7] Let me now briefly discuss macroprudential policies in the euro area, where the macroprudential framework is special with complementary roles for national macroprudential authorities and the ECB. In this environment, there are also special needs for macroprudential analysis and research. In the euro area, as elsewhere, national authorities bear the main responsibility for national macroprudential policies. They are always in the best position to detect country-specific systemic risks and to take appropriate measures to address them. These national policies are organized differently in different countries. In Finland, for example, the designated macroprudential authority is the financial supervisor, the FIN-FSA. In many euro area countries, however, the national macroprudential authority is the central bank or a council of domestic authorities. In November last year, the ECB took over the responsibility of supervising banks in the euro area. It is less well-known that at the same time the ECB became the ultimate macroprudential decision-maker in the Banking Union. More specifically, the ECB can apply higher requirements for specific macroprudential tools than proposed by the designated national macroprudential authorities, if it deems that the suggested national measures are inadequate. In the euro area, the role of national macroprudential policies is particularly important in general and also at the current juncture. There are several reasons for that: First, the absence of national monetary policies puts heightened demands on national macroprudential policies in reducing domestic systemic risks. Second, as the financial systems in the euro area countries are highly integrated, different macroprudential risks and problems can easily and rapidly spread across borders. Third, the current accommodative monetary policies of the ECB and other central banks can have some unintended side effects on the financial system, which, if regarded serious, need to be addressed by macroprudential policies. In this framework, there is a special need for analysis and research at least on the following topics: How big are the macroprudential risks related to strong interconnectedness between euro area financial institutions and markets? How important are the cross-border spillovers of national macroprudential actions (and inactions)? How to reduce the potential inaction bias of national macroprudential policies? What are the biggest macroprudential risks related to the current low interest rate environment? What, if any, macroprudential measures should the policy-makers use to reduce those potential risks? I challenge the research community to address these issues in addition to the important topics covered in this Conference. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  III. Learning the lessons while not fighting the last war [Slide 8] In recent years, and rightly so, much of the regulatory reform and research agenda has been shaped by the experiences of the global financial crisis of 2007–2009. But the regulatory and academic communities should not end up looking at the rear view mirror for too long. I want to highlight three recent phenomena which call for increased attention. The first is the recent shift of credit intermediation away from the banking sector to the debt securities market. In many ways, this is a welcome development, especially in Europe with its heavy dependence on banks. Some recent studies suggest that excessively large banking sectors can be associated not only with lower economic growth but also with higher systemic risk.4 In addition, excessive reliance of European SME´s on bank finance has been one of the reasons for the European Commission to launch its plan for the European Capital Markets Union. But, as asked by Jaime Caruana in his recent speech, “Is a market-driven boom more or less risky than a bank-driven boom?”5 We do not know for sure, but we should try to find out. Second, banking-like activities are again shifting to the so called shadow banking sector, and thereby potentially outside the perimeter of regulatory rules. This may imply new threats to financial stability, with which macroprudential policy may have to have tools to deal. The third issue which deserves close attention is the effects of digitalization on banking, which are likely to be wide-ranging. I believe we have some understanding of the potential benefits of digitalization, but we need to know more about the risks. IV. Conclusions [Slide 9] Let me conclude. A better understanding of systemic risks – to which this Conference also contributes – can help policy-makers in designing better regulation and in conducting timely and effective macroprudential policy more generally. With regard to the more static form of regulatory rules, research could guide regulators to find a right balance between simplicity and comprehensiveness. With regard to macroprudential policy which requires discretionary decisions, reliable analysis and research can help policy-makers to avoid the pitfalls of excessive passivity. However, we should remain humble. To complement quantitative analysis, we continue to need sound expert judgment. Weak signals of risks and potential crises have to be given due consideration. Grass root level experts and their experience should be valued, and they should be encouraged to speak out. What is particularly needed is expert ability to imagine unlikely but possible scenarios which present big threats to financial stability. Perhaps more human resources should be allocated to conduct such thought experiments on a regular basis. The results of such experiments should be regularly exposed to a discussion by top management to avoid the dangers of group thinking.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sabine Lautenschläger: Reintegrating the banking sector into society – earning and re-establishing trust Speech by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, at the 7th International Banking Conference “Tomorrow’s bank business model – How far are we from the new equilibrium”, organised by Bocconi University, Milan, 28 September 2015. *      *      * Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed audience, First of all let me thank the organisers of this conference, and especially Andrea Sironi, for their kind invitation. I very much welcome this opportunity to elaborate on what I think are currently some of the most important questions in banking: How can bankers regain the trust that was lost during the crisis? How can the banking sector be reintegrated into society? There is no doubt that banks, bankers and the whole industry are experiencing one of the worst crises of confidence ever. The turmoil of 2008 and 2009 played a major role in this loss of public trust, but the problem did not end after the most acute phase of the crisis. Even seven years later, confidence in the banking sector is still very low. Numerous scandals, like the manipulation of LIBOR rates, large-scale tax evasion, the fraudulent behaviour of rogue traders, misconduct in the selling of mortgages, and large taxpayer bailouts of banks, have reinforced the perception that wrongdoing is widespread in the banking sector. But mistrust is not only confined to banks themselves. Investors and clients also have less confidence in the correct functioning of the banking sector and in the ability of supervisors and regulators to prevent excessive risk-taking. We should worry about this loss of trust in the banking sector: • It impairs the proper functioning of banks to reallocate resources. • It hampers growth. • It leads to instability and costly crises. In a recent paper, Gennaioli et al.1 illustrated the role that trust plays in banking by comparing finance to medicine. Banking, is a service like healthcare, in which “transactions” take place between two parties that differ in terms of information, knowledge and technical competence. Patients put themselves in the hands of their doctor, and investors, like patients, would like to be in good hands and not be taken advantage of. But how can trust in the banking sector be restored? Who are the key players in this process? Is it enough to reform the regulatory and supervisory framework, as we have done in recent years?                                                 1 See Gennaioli, N., Schleifer, A., and Vishny, R.W.

   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Banks, intermediation and trust Let me start by using a simplification of the activities of banks to explain why it is worthwhile investing in regaining trust. Traditionally, the core activity of a commercial bank is to take deposits from individuals who have a surplus of resources and to allocate those resources to productive activities. Banks thereby perform three main functions. First, they provide payment and settlement services to households, entrepreneurs, companies and other financial institutions. Second, they enable savers to reap the full benefits of long-term investments, while still being able to access liquidity when needed. Third, they assess and monitor the creditworthiness and payment behaviour of borrowers more efficiently than an individual investor could. Through these activities, banks reduce the inefficiencies caused by asymmetric information and incentive problems between those who save and those who borrow. It is mainly via this channel, that banks create value and contribute to economic growth. However, even though banks assess and monitor borrowers’ creditworthiness, savers may still be concerned about whether banks – and their managements – have the necessary skills and will make the required effort to protect their savings. Asymmetric information and incentive problems are still present, but arise at new, different levels: no longer between savers and borrowers, but between savers, bankers and supervisors. In the relationship between banks and their creditors, incentive conflicts may arise between managers on one side (who set the bank’s strategy, make investment decisions and monitor the performance of investment projects and the payment behaviour of debtors) and shareholders and debt holders on the other side (who provide the bank’s funding and who bear the ultimate risks and receive the benefits of the bank’s activities). Information problems may also occur among banks that are linked by mutual business relationships or collective vulnerabilities to systemic events. Asymmetric information and incentive problems can be addressed through contracts, institutions and appropriate regulatory and supervisory frameworks. But this is a rather abstract and idealised view. In reality, more is needed: trust is needed. The medical analogy is a handy way to illustrate this. Patients can always sue doctors for malpractice. They could always enforce the “contract” with their doctor. However, no patient will ever consult a doctor whom he does not trust, even though he can sue him. The same applies to banking. In general, creditors will not deposit money in a bank whose integrity and soundness they do not trust. Shareholders can set up remuneration schemes to incentivise managers whose activities they cannot monitor full time. But shareholders also need to trust their managers, because not all of their activities are perfectly contractible and, even if they were, it could be difficult and time-consuming to enforce the incentive contract in court. At this point, one could interject that, while trust may have been essential for banking in the past, this is no longer the case today. Our economy and society have undergone dramatic changes in recent decades, which have also affected banks. Innovation and technological progress have reduced the need for trust in some situations. Computerisation has allowed banks to use data-driven applications rather than rely on expert judgement for the evaluation of creditworthiness of borrowers or the pricing of financial products. However, banks and their business have become much more complex than they used to be, which increases the asymmetry of information and, hence, the need for trust. For example, it is not now uncommon for banks now to have multiple parent-subsidiary structures operating in different jurisdictions across the globe. Some banking products have become so sophisticated that most people, even some bankers, no longer fully understand them. By the 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  way, I expect every CEO or Board member to do without products which they do not understand. Today, banks are more complex to manage harder to monitor and their activities are more difficult to understand than was previously the case, and the asymmetric information and incentive problems I mentioned earlier are more prominent than ever. In short, trust is and has always been essential for banks to carry out their activities, foster economic growth and add value to society. Banking is and always has been trusting. What can be done to restore trust? Given the currently low level of confidence in, and within, banks, what needs to be done to rebuild trust? The role of regulatory reform First, whose job is it to regain trust? In the aftermath of the crisis, significant changes have been made in the regulatory and supervisory framework. Reforms of capital and liquidity regulation, risk management, governance and resolution regimes have been introduced. Moreover, consumer protection has been enhanced. The regulatory framework now has a better and broader base, and is less vulnerable to arbitrage. While much has been achieved, I would like to highlight one piece of work in particular. Last year, the Financial Stability Board published a set of guidelines on supervisory interaction with banks on risk culture. The guidelines are aimed at assisting supervisors in their assessment of risk culture by listing a number of indicators or practices that can be indicative of an overall sound and well-balanced approach. These include an appropriate “tone from the top” within a bank and other key factors, such as accountability, effective internal communication, the existence of challenge mechanisms within the decision-making process, and incentives for employees. Supervisors themselves have also changed since the crisis. They are now stricter, more pro-active and assess banks in a much more holistic way. Topics such as governance, remuneration and risk appetite are among the key priorities on every supervisor’s agenda this year. In the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) for example, we are in the final stages of a thematic review of governance and risk appetite in the 123 institutions directly supervised by us which will feed into this year’s assessments of the capital and liquidity adequacy of banks. Our initial findings indicate that a number of banks, while meeting national requirements, do not comply with international best practices with regard to governance. Our key observations include examples of power concentration in individual board members (e.g. holding multiple offices or chairmanships within the same group), a lack of separation between a bank’s risk and audit functions, information asymmetries among board members, and instances where the board simply does not take enough time to discuss and reflect on individual issues. It is also apparent that some banks are still in the early stages of implementing their risk appetite framework and therefore still have a lot of work to do to ensure its consistent application throughout the entire organisation. All of these issues reduce the quality of decision-making and risk awareness within a bank and can obscure or even encourage malpractice. Therefore, we will require banks to follow up on these findings. But are the efforts of regulators and supervisors enough? Can trust be rebuilt simply by having better and more credible rules? Our finance-medicine analogy suggests that the answer to these questions is no. It is the doctor who holds the key to earning the trust of his patients. Likewise, rebuilding trust in the 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  banking sector requires the active engagement of bankers and their stakeholders. Regulatory and supervisory reforms are necessary, but not sufficient to restore people’s trust in banks. My view is that, while regulatory reform and supervisory action were certainly necessary to lay the foundations on which banks can restore trust, regulators and supervisors are not the key players in this process. The main effort to regain trust must come from bankers, in particular from banks’ management and their boards as the tone from the top as well as the accountability of banks’ top management are key for risk culture and staff’s behaviour. Without their active effort, society will not start to trust again. The necessary process will be laborious and time-consuming; and it will not be one measure or action that does the job, but rather a complex mixture of governance, risk appetite, risk culture and behaviour from the top. The role of banks and their stakeholders in restoring trust So what must bankers do to rebuild trust? First, bank’s management should develop viable business models with a clear long-term perspective. Many of the recent crises have been the consequence of banks targeting high, but risky, short-term gains rather than pursuing lower, but more stable, long-term returns. Banks should refocus on their core functions: • providing valuable investment opportunities to savers, while shielding them from liquidity risk, and • providing funds to those who need them, while assessing and monitoring their creditworthiness. Financial intermediation is not simply a way to garner revenues; it also supports economic growth and thus, ultimately, provides an important service to society. Significant changes in the economic environment in recent decades have diverted banks from these core functions. It seems that the combination of an increased range of investment opportunities and funding sources, a trend towards more liberal regulation, and an increasingly competitive environment caused banks to reshuffle their priorities towards maximising short-term corporate and often also personal gain. The change in banks’ business models from “originate to hold” to “originate to repackage and sell”, which was the proverbial spark in the tinder box that set off the financial crisis, can be seen as a prime example of losing sight of the goal of maximising long-term value. Second, a bank’s management and board must have a sense of responsibility for developing the bank’s individual risk culture, thus enabling it to deal with risk in a way that supports this long-term business perspective and fosters transparency and accountability. Every bank needs a strong cultural base, which should embody the bank’s essence and aspirations and embrace its role as a profit-oriented organisation without neglecting its relevance for the well-being of national economies and for the finances of both individuals and corporations. • This strong cultural base should serve as a shared value framework throughout the organisation. • On top of these foundations, every bank needs clear risk-taking policies, allowing it to reach its business objectives, while ensuring that risk-taking activities beyond the institution’s risk appetite can be identified and addressed in a timely manner. • To complement this, there must be clear governance arrangements defining processes and responsibilities for decision-making, risk management, control and audit. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  • Lastly, a bank requires well-functioning communication mechanisms and IT systems to link the bank’s decision-making, risk management and control organs together, to convey information to where it is needed, and to help create awareness and transparency about the bank’s objectives, policies and values throughout the organisation. Changing an existing culture and the way an organisation thinks about its business is clearly a major challenge. In particular, at a time when the banking sector as a whole is having to comprehensively rethink the values it embodies and the culture it lives.2 Although some progress has been achieved recently, much more is still needed. In this context, I welcome the continued initiative of policy-makers to stimulate further progress in this area. For example, in May this year, the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors urged the Financial Stability Board to begin developing a bankers’ “code of conduct” to complement the existing guidance. Third, banks’ senior management and boards have to create adequate incentive schemes, including remuneration policies, to promote long-term perspectives within their organisation. We have witnessed too many scandals over recent years, too many cases of misconduct where responsible parties were not sufficiently held accountable. We have witnessed banks cooperating only reluctantly in criminal investigations, and we have seen interest groups rejecting outright any attempt to reform remuneration in the banking sector. Regaining trust will not be easy. Bank managers must convince the public that they will reward socially beneficial behaviour, while unacceptable behaviour will be credibly sanctioned, up to the top.3 Most importantly, people need to believe that managers will be truly responsible for the conduct of those who report to them. To achieve a turnaround in public sentiment, those working in banks must believe in the value of sustainable business models and ethical behaviour. The tone from the top is key in this endeavour – the message must be that not everything that is legal is also legitimate and that the bank is only interested in legitimate business. This may require a considerable revision of human resources policies, too. • For a start, senior management could think about introducing new recruitment and training guidelines that indicate what sort of talent and personalities should be hired and how the bank’s values should be taught to employees. • A well-balanced combination of monetary and non-monetary incentives should be in place. Staff should have reasonable compensation and development options aligned with the behaviour they exhibit in implementing the bank’s desired values and culture. Remuneration, performance evaluation and promotion systems should be calibrated in such a way that they reward client orientation, long-term value creation and sound risk management practices rather than short-term revenues. One possibility could be to extend even further the existing claw-back times for bonuses to discourage unacceptable behaviour, possibly up to seven years. • Staff should face clear rules on responsibility, liability and integrity and be subject to proportionate follow-up or disciplinary measures in the case of infringements.                                                 2 For a discussion on the role of culture in the financial industry and its interaction with monetary incentives in shaping behaviours, see Lo, A.W. (2015), “The Gordon Gekko Effect: The Role of Culture in the Financial Industry”, NBER Working Paper, No 21267. 3 On the importance of “cleansing” the sector of adverse practices and behaviours in order to “reintegrate” banks into society, see Hartmann, P.

(eds.), The New International Financial System: Analyzing the Cumulative Impact of Regulatory Reform, Hackensack, NJ: World Scientific Publishing. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Last, but not least, the expectations of bank shareholders are critical and key to  re-establishing trust. Their demand for higher returns puts pressure on banks and induces them to embark on risky business activities. Hence, efforts to restore trust cannot be successful without a corresponding change in attitude among shareholders. They must understand that there is no such thing as a “free lunch”. Properly adjusting for risk, shareholders may actually be better off when banks behave cooperatively and achieve a high level of trust. The role of bankers’ self-interest Having identified possible actions bankers can take to restore trust, an important question remains. Why should bankers ever take such actions? Is it in their own interest? As I stressed before, trust is essential for the functioning of the banking sector. Without trust, banks cannot function properly. This not only has negative consequences for the rest of the economy, but also negatively affects banks themselves. There are several channels through which a lack of trust negatively affects banks. First, it is a potential root cause of crises. Crises usually lead to a significant and often long-lasting contraction in bank profits, as can be seen, for instance, from the large drop in the S&P 500 index for the banking sector. Moreover, they are usually followed by an “aggressive” regulatory response to constrain banking activities. Second, a lack of trust negatively impacts on the relationship between regulators and banks. The interaction tends to become more adversarial. Regulators become less willing to listen to bankers and to take their views on how to do business into account. Third, a lack of trust in some banks and bankers usually translates into a negative sentiment towards the entire industry. This, in turn, has negative implications for business. Customers may leave, and it is more difficult to recruit talent. But this negative sentiment not only has repercussions for banks’ business prospects, it also affects the social standing of bankers, whose image is often tarnished in society. Concluding remarks Let me conclude. The recent crisis is a stark reminder that banking is trusting. The dramatic changes in the banking environment brought about by financial innovation and technological progress have not diminished the role of trust in banking. Any lack of trust significantly impairs the functioning of the banking sector and prevents banks from contributing to economic growth. A lack of trust also negatively affects banks’ business and profitability. It is in the banks’ collective interest to restore and preserve a high level of trust in, and within, the banking sector. Rebuilding trust is a long and complex process. It certainly requires effort on the part of regulators and supervisors, and a lot has been achieved there. But, ultimately, as the analogy with the trust between doctors and patients makes clear, most of the heavy lifting will have to be done by the banks – their senior managements, boards and shareholders – themselves. There is plenty that they can do and should be doing. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Monetary policy lessons from the financial crisis – some remarks Dinner speech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the SNB Research Conference, organised by the Swiss National Bank, Zurich, 24 September 2015. *      *      * It is a pleasure for me to share with you some thoughts on the topic of this conference. Let me start with a word of caution. I think we are not yet in a position to draw firm lessons. The final verdict on many aspects of the crisis and the way policy-makers, including central bankers, reacted to it – both globally and in their respective jurisdictions – is still out. Therefore, somewhat less ambitiously, please allow me to offer some remarks on the conference topic. Based on my own experience, the overarching challenge that was faced by major central banks in terms of their response to the recent financial crisis can be captured with two insights. First, when the crisis intensified at a global level, we faced a trade-off we had not seen for a very long time, namely how to prevent the meltdown of the financial system without causing undue harm to the incentive constraints that are of vital importance for the functioning of market-based economies. The pre-crisis macroeconomic debate had spent considerable time and effort explaining that negative supply side shocks could present central bankers with a very difficult decision: whether to stabilise inflation at the cost of slowing growth further, or be more patient at bringing inflation back to target at the cost of destabilising inflation expectations. We thought that a situation like this was the worst scenario for central bankers. Therefore, when we finally faced the post-Lehman Brothers meltdown and the different – and far more serious – decision of handling panic against preserving incentives, the required experience on how to deal with it had, to some extent, been lost. We could consult history books – the recurrent financial crises of the 19th century were regularly haunting central bankers – but not macroeconomic textbooks. Second, while a global meltdown had successfully been prevented, a second type of trade-off emerged, which is typical for balance sheet recessions.1 What essentially had happened is that banks, emerging painfully from a liquidity crisis, had started to deleverage actively in an attempt to structurally reduce liquidity needs by shedding excess exposures. The deleveraging was an additional downside force contributing to the slump. In this situation, a central banker is again torn between two priorities. You want banks to reduce excess exposures, because this is a precondition for the economy to return to healthy growth. In other words, you would like banks to deleverage in an orderly way. At the same time, you face the danger that, at the aggregate level, any type of credit contraction will undermine demand severely, and a deeper contraction will make it difficult or impossible for the central bank to deliver on its price stability mandate. True, you can also argue that central banks have some leeway – within their mandate – to facilitate the needed adjustments. For example, the time horizon for normalising inflation is generally not set in calendar time, and is often made conditional on shocks. This allows the central bank to accept more disinflation – and for longer – during the transition than it would tolerate in different balance sheet conditions. But there is a limit to this. The reason central banks have been given mandates that are expressed in terms of numerical objectives for                                                 1  For details, see the speech entitled Monetary policy and balance sheet adjustment delivered at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra on 27 May 2014. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  inflation is because legislatures realised that central banks’ discretion had to be constrained. Their reaction functions had to be made predictable within a horizon which is realistic and, at the same time, verifiable by electorates. So, what is the role of monetary policy in this scenario? Maintaining a very accommodative policy stance for too long certainly carries significant risks. Incentives for timely balance sheet repair may be undermined and new imbalances may ultimately emerge. Still, central banks will have to remain true to their mandates of ensuring price stability. This mandate should be interpreted as a symmetric mandate. Too low inflation, or even deflation, for a prolonged period of time cannot be seen as consistent with price stability. This is the overarching challenge, as I see it, and I will come back to some of the elements involved in more detail. I will now turn to three specific remarks of global relevance, before I make two concluding observations that are specific to the euro area. A. General remarks At a global level, the financial crisis created an environment in which many central banks resorted to unconventional measures because the conventional instrument, the short-term policy rate, had become constrained by the lower bound. In the jargon of papers written before the crisis, it is simple to say what happened: many central banks hit the famous zero lower bound (ZLB). The euro area, as I will mention at the end, reached the lower bound through a different avenue. And the end point of that journey, as you know, was not zero, but a negative point. Remark 1: The ZLB constraint has turned out to be more binding than previously thought. What was the pre-crisis consensus? As concerns the United States, let me quote from the paper entitled “Have We Underestimated the Likelihood and Severity of Zero Lower Bound Events?”, written by John Williams and co-authors working for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.2 The paper documents predictions from the Fed’s FRB/US model (a large-scale macroeconometric model) for the frequency and duration of ZLB episodes. The key finding is that, “if monetary policy followed the prescriptions of the standard Taylor (1993) rule with an inflation target of 2 percent, the federal funds rate would be near zero about 5 percent of the time and the “typical” ZLB episode would last four quarters”. Moreover, “the ZLB would have relatively minor effects on macroeconomic performance under these policy assumptions.” With regard to the euro area, you may recall that zero lower bound considerations were a relevant concern for the ECB’s strategy review in 2003. At that time, the Governing Council clarified that, within the ECB’s definition of price stability of positive inflation rates below 2%, it would aim to maintain inflation rates “below, but close to, 2%” over the medium term. This clarification was seen to offer a safety margin away from zero nominal interest rates and zero or negative inflation rates. In this spirit, the overview of the background studies concluded that “most available studies indicate that the likelihood [of hitting the ZLB] decreases to very low levels when the objective of the central bank is to set an inflation rate above 1%”.3 These quotes describe the view which prevailed prior to the crisis. But today, for the United States, it is nearly seven years ago that the bound was reached. And for the euro area, seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, we are still struggling with headline inflation near zero. Most likely, it will still take some time before the Governing Council’s aim                                                 2  Chung, H., Laforte, J.-P., Reifschneider, D. and Williams, J.C., “Have We Underestimated the Likelihood and Severity of Zero Lower Bound Events?”, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 44, 2012, pp. 47–82. 3  Background Studies for the ECB’s Evaluation of its Monetary Policy Strategy, European Central Bank, November 2003. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  of levels below but close to 2% is reached. Current ECB staff projections foresee inflation at 1.7% by the end of our projection horizon, 2017. So, what was overlooked in pre-crisis times? Going beyond the fact that the crisis caught us “culturally unprepared” as I tried to say before, the answer is a combination of factors. At a deeper level, models had been shaped too much by the Great Moderation period. They were lacking structural relationships, propagation mechanisms and shocks that have become globally relevant since the onset of the crisis. One example may suffice to make the point: the likelihood of ZLB events depends strongly on what you assume for the equilibrium real rate. A level of 2%, an assumption often made in pre-crisis models, is far from “innocent”: If you estimate the frequency of lower bound hits by shocking a model whose steady state nominal interest rate is 4%, because the real rate of equilibrium is assumed to be 2% and 2% is steady state inflation, the occurrences of zero or negative interest rates will be much fewer than if you start from a steady state of 3% (2% inflation and 1% natural rate). With hindsight, it seems safe to point out that models were by and large lacking features like a non-trivial financial side, sufficient consideration of demographic developments and deep global linkages. In sum, it seems that it was not only the general design of the mainstream pre-crisis models that made them inadequate for interpreting the crisis, but also the fact that they relied on data mostly drawn from the time of the Great Moderation. Remark 2: At the lower bound, monetary policy has remained effective via non-standard measures. Before the crisis, central bankers were aware that non-standard monetary policies would be required when the main policy rate reached the zero lower bound. However, the effectiveness of these policies was not taken as given. Prominent lines of research, for example, had been debating the irrelevance of central bank asset purchases.4 Today, with the benefit of several years of experience of implementing such policies, central banks have shown these policies to be effective. They have demonstrated that monetary policy has the necessary toolkit to influence the yield curve along different horizons, including the use of forward guidance. Indeed, this capability acts as a counterargument to the proposal that the ZLB restriction should be overcome via the adoption of a higher inflation target. It seems that the hurdle for this suggestion has become even higher. A shift to a higher inflation target would not only raise significant credibility issues ‒ we should also remember that prevailing definitions of price stability have a welfare foundation.5 Everything else being equal, higher inflation objectives inevitably come together with distortions that are harmful from a welfare perspective. Meanwhile, we are still furthering our understanding of the many features which characterise non-standard measures. Empirically, estimates of the effects of such measures on activity and inflation vary sizeably across studies. And inflation remains below central banks’ targets in many jurisdictions. At a conceptual level, the discussion on shadow rate measures shows how difficult it is to find a metric which makes the various dimensions of large-scale asset purchases comparable with ordinary rate cuts. We all grew accustomed to measuring the stance through the Taylor rules. But when a central bank intervenes on the long end of the curve, the stimulus that is injected through those interventions escapes the simple Taylor metric, which is centred on the short end where the lower bound binds. The shadow rate                                                 4  Eggertsson, G. and Woodford, M., The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2003, 1, pp. 139–211. 5  Schmitt-Grohe, S. and Uribe, M.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  attempts to re-establish the status of the short-term interest rate as a signal of monetary conditions by including information on how unconventional policies alter broader financing conditions. The idea is very appealing. But we need to test these new measures – which yield very disperse measures of the stance – before we can use them in policy work. The potential costs and side-effects from shifting the long end of the yield curve are also a matter of controversy. For example, the profession needs a better understanding of the distributional implications of quantitative easing (QE), although it seems clear that policy inaction in an environment of low growth and high unemployment also has distributional consequences. In sum, we have seen that unconventional measures are effective in terms of arresting disinflation, preventing fears of a slide into deflation and supporting aggregate demand. But it is fair to say that we need to understand more about their transmission in order to see whether QE can be retained as an instrument that, if not conventional, can play a valuable and reliable role in the toolbox to which central banks can make recourse. Remark 3: ZLB and non-conventional policies pose extra challenges vis-à-vis normalisation. Looking ahead, when the monetary policy tightening cycle eventually commences, it is very likely to be different and more challenging than in previous cycles. Just try to picture the recent history of policy rates for some major central banks in a chart. That chart would look odd on both the y-axis and the x-axis: in some major economies, zero has featured for longer than any other value of the policy rate before. This makes some of us think that the non-linearity imparted by the lower bound and generally thought to apply to the policy rate on the way down may exert, for different reasons, an impact also on the way out of the lower bound. The economy may have just gotten too used to that number. For one thing, rate increases will have to be carefully aligned with the normalisation of central bank balance sheets. There will be some division of tasks between instruments to be thought through and organised: what portion of accommodation can be removed – quite conventionally – by raising short-term rates, and what portion by active management of portfolios, i.e. by applying controlled pressure on long-term rates. The profile and evolution of short-term rates and the shape of the term structure will probably look different than in previous normalisation cycles. The ECB is a long way from these challenges, but other central banks are confronting these as I speak. B. Euro-area specific remarks In respect of the euro area, these general remarks require some modification. For brevity, let me focus on two aspects. Remark 4: The ECB hit the lower bound later than many other central banks, and when it did it was not the zero lower bound, but a negative lower bound. Similarly, it resorted at a late stage to large-scale asset purchases. It stands out that the ECB’s monetary policy became distinctly unconventional at an early stage – not least with the adoption of fixed-rate full allotment tenders in its refinancing operations back in 2008, and with short incursions into this unknown territory already in 2007. Moreover, this practice was later expanded to longer horizons, when policy rates still stood at firmly positive levels. This approach was naturally developed in view of the predominantly bank-based nature of the euro area financial system. It led to a rather passive mode of liquidity injection, very much in the tradition of the lender-of-last-resort function of a central bank. This very important tradition owes much to Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot. But you can read Bagehot without knowing what the ZLB is and how it affects the ability of a central bank to provide stimulus under conditions of insufficient aggregate demand. The ECB adopted a more active control of balance sheet developments only at a much later stage, in the course of last year, ultimately leading to the adoption of the expanded asset purchase programme (APP). Through the APP, via its reliance on outright purchases, the ECB regained a more direct control over the size of the balance sheet. And it 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  was in this context that short-term rates effectively had to reach a lower bound configuration. I think there is little disagreement that, in terms of stimulating demand, this is a precondition for realising the maximum impact of large-scale purchases of securities of various types and maturities via rebalancing and signalling effects. Let me briefly elaborate on why I said that short-term rates “effectively” had to reach a lower bound configuration. The pre-crisis view, with its focus on the “zero” lower bound created a misleading label. Given that the interest rate on sight deposits held with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is currently standing at minus 75 basis points, we can rule out that the constraint binds strictly at zero. In the euro area, the interest rate on the deposit facility stands at minus 20 basis points. We have got used to the fact that money market rates (as well as a good range of other interest rates) can be negative. So, one thing we have surely learned is that “zero is rather something minus”. In this particular sense, the “zero” lower bound has turned out to be less binding than previously thought. In the euro area, negative rates have been powerful in propagating the policy stimulus for two reasons.6 First, in terms of available policy instruments, negative rates can, to a certain extent, be seen as a substitute for quantitative interventions. Bringing the overnight interest rate to a negative level already in June last year de facto meant that we started generating effects – to a certain degree – that one expects to see under quantitative policies. Second, the negative rate policy complements the channels through which the APP operates. A negative rate on bank reserves is an inducement for banks to lend money balances on and to avoid the tax that would otherwise be paid on them. This should lead to an increase in the velocity of circulation of cash reserves, which is another way to trigger an acceleration in the portfolio rebalancing effect that is a key component in the transmission of asset purchases to the real economy. Remark 5: Going forward, the effectiveness of monetary policy will improve with a more complete European Monetary Union. Has the just described special sequencing of the ECB’s unconventional monetary policy measures been appropriate? To answer this question, we should recall that the euro area has its own distinct characteristics. And, as a currency union, it is in many ways incomplete. In the language of the “Five Presidents’ Report”, “Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) today is like a house that was built over decades but only partially finished. It is now high time to reinforce its foundations and turn it into what EMU was meant to be”. This diagnosis explains why, looking back, measures of first resort in other jurisdictions have been measures of last resort in the euro area. In particular, it is clear that, in the euro area, central bank purchases of sovereign debt raise additional questions which are quasi-non-issues in consolidated nation states. And, going forward, this diagnosis also makes it clear why the euro area faces extra challenges. We have to find the right balance in what Markus Brunnermeier recently described as the “stimulus versus reform debate” at the European Economic Association conference in Mannheim.7 As I said on the same occasion, in a similar spirit, we need to bring together two different macroeconomic traditions. • The “macroeconomic” tradition, by which I pretty much mean the British and “saltwater American” tradition of macroeconomics, with its solid emphasis on demand management. It correctly identifies the need to provide stimulus but may have a tendency to overlook incentives and institutions. Here, a focus on “demand                                                 6  See my speech on Price stability: a sinking will-o’-the-wisp? at the IMF Spring Meetings Seminar, Washington, 16 April 2015. 7  His slides are available via http://www.eeassoc.org/index.php?site=EEA2015&page=267&trsz=239 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  management” may lead to losing sight of the longer term and the incentives that are put in place. • The “supply-side” tradition, in all of its incarnations, including the “freshwater American” real business cycle scholars and the older – somewhat forgotten – continental European “institutional school”, which identifies the need for structural policies and structural reforms as a precondition for spurring enduring growth. It rightly draws attention to the power of institutions in reconciling the economic incentives of different actors – private agents or governments. But it may downplay the harm that fluctuations in demand and incomes could potentially cause to economies. Also, the institutionalists may have a tendency to worship the rule of current law. Thus, it may fail to see the shortcomings of the legal framework in place in terms of preventing the economy from spiralling off to bad equilibria with no prospect of return. A synthesis of these traditions is what we need for the euro area. One can call this “dynamic institutionalism”. Ideally, it should take the optimisation framework of macroeconomics and apply it to institutional design. Such an approach can make an important contribution to charting out the transition to new steady states – as identified, for example, by the Five Presidents’ report. It should do this in a way that respects the unique multinational nature of monetary union and upholds and preserves the mutual responsibility that each nation is expected to have vis-à-vis all the others. Thank you for your kind attention.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sukhdave Singh: Financial governance and economic growth Keynote address by Dr Sukhdave Singh, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the Malaysian Economic Convention “Financial Governance and Economic Growth”, Kuala Lumpur, 28 September 2015. *      *      * It is indeed an honour to be speaking to such a distinguished audience. It is also a great pleasure for me to be here this morning and join my colleagues in the Economics fraternity at this 2015 Malaysian Economic Convention. To begin, let me share with you a story. Twenty years ago, on 28 January 1986, the NASA space shuttle Challenger was launched. Seventy-three seconds into its flight, spectators were horrified as the space shuttle broke apart in a fiery display and disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean. Seven astronauts died. The catastrophe was traced to the failure of a single O-ring – a simple seal at a joint on one of the rocket boosters. The O-ring failed due to the unusually cold temperatures on the morning of the launch. Relative to the highly sophisticated technologies involved in building and launching the shuttle, the O-ring was considered established technology, one with a patent history of 90 years by the time the Challenger was launched. It was as ironic as it was instructive that such a complex machine, incorporating the most advanced aerospace technology of its time, failed and combusted due to a component as trivial and basic as an O-ring. Six years later, Michael Kremer, an economist at Harvard University, formulated the O-ring theory of economic development1. According to him, if strategic complementarity is sufficiently strong within a system, O-ring effects can create low-production traps. Financial Times columnist Tim Hartford relates Kremer’s theory to the concept of weak links2. When systems have a strong element of interdependence, weak links begin to have a more multiplicative effect, rather than an additive effect, on the overall outcomes of the system. A musical band is only as good as its least experienced player. A dance troupe is only as synchronised as its worst dancer. Today’s economies and financial systems have undoubtedly become more intricately interlinked across agents, markets and nations. This progression brings benefits as it unlocks new synergies and uncovers diverse sources of growth. However, the increased interdependence also increases the potential for O-ring type effects. Any single component within this complex web of economic and financial relationships can become the weak link of the system, with highly detrimental effects on the system’s stability and on economic growth. The financial crisis of 2008–2009 in the advanced economies was a good illustration of an O-ring weak link, whereby a seemingly small segment of the US financial system – the subprime mortgage market – triggered an economic crisis that reverberated around the world and the effects of which are still being felt today. In many ways, the build-up of vulnerabilities that led to the crisis arose from a series of bad financial decisions made by borrowers, bankers, investors and regulators. This brings forth the importance of sound financial governance as a fundamental element of robust economies and financial systems, one that ensures that the possibility of the existence of weak links within the system is minimised.                                                 1  Kremer, M.

   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Today, I would like to discuss three inter-related issues relevant to the theme of this conference. First and briefly, the issue of global financial governance. Then I will focus at greater length on the relationship between financial governance and economic growth at the national level. The third and final part of my remarks will cover the governance of finance. Global financial governance: a lack of urgency Let me start with global financial governance. I will be brief on this as much of the discussion has been had elsewhere at various other platforms. Since the demise of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s, while the global monetary and financial system has become more integrated and sophisticated, global financial governance has changed little. The financial crisis in the advanced economies and the years since have clearly delineated the fault lines in the global system and accentuated the dire lack of effective global financial governance. One would think that there would be a greater sense of urgency in collaborating to ensure that weak links in the system do not have wide-spread contagion. Unfortunately, there is no such sense of urgency. At its core, the global system remains uneven, unanchored and unorganised. Let me elaborate. First, the foundations of the international financial architecture are uneven. As everyone is aware, there is an over reliance on the US dollar as the reserve currency and by extension, an over-concentration of risk with the US economy and financial system. The burden of adjustment is asymmetrical across countries – between deficit and surplus countries, between debtors and creditors and between governments and the private sector. Despite the higher contribution of emerging economies to world growth, global policy priorities, decision making and standard setting remain largely the domain of the advanced economies. Second, the system is unanchored and crisis prone. With no guideposts, automatic corrective mechanisms or coordination to facilitate adjustment, the system is prone to excesses and is perpetually facing disequilibrium conditions, resulting in persistent global imbalances in terms of both the current and capital accounts, and the unsustainable build-up of debt. With no means to correct itself, adjustments often occur through costly upheavals in the form of balance of payments or financial crises. Third, the system is unorganised with inadequate global response mechanisms. There is neither an effective platform nor an established framework for policy coordination or for crisis containment, management and resolution. There is also no true global lender of last resort as the IMF itself has only limited resources. This has led to the rise of governance innovations amongst many economies, including Malaysia and its neighbours. Since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, various initiatives have fostered stronger regional cooperation, including information sharing and alternative liquidity support arrangements that are bilateral or regional in scope. While these efforts have reinforced the region’s defences against external shocks, they have not reduced the vulnerability of individual economies to external shocks. Were the fault lines in the global monetary and financial system to widen, there is no guarantee that emerging economies like ours will not be dragged into those crevices. Given the lack of global initiatives to close those fault lines, what economies like Malaysia must do is to ensure that our house is strong. We must build-up our defences and have the resilience to withstand the volatility and headwinds created by the global economic and financial environment. One important source of that resilience is having sound financial governance at all levels of our society: the government, the corporate sector and the household sector. Financial governance: foundation of sustainable economic growth Financial governance sets the stage for sound financial decision-making. Broadly defined, strong financial governance is a sum of many parts including strong institutions, efficient processes, and effective rules, regulations and norms. It affects the way financial decisions 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  are made, including decisions relating to savings and spending, borrowing and lending, investment and profit distribution, and it is relevant to all economic agents, be they households, businesses or governments. Soundness of financial governance is a critical prerequisite for the sustainable growth of any economy. Having said that, we also have to recognise that the process of economic growth itself is an outcome of a system that is highly complex and adaptive, and that a country’s economy, polity and society – and the institutions that underpin each of these – are embedded within a complex network of interdependencies. Therefore, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all prescription of what constitutes good financial governance for all economies. Nevertheless, I do believe that we can recognise the presence or absence of good financial governance based on broad characteristics. In this regard, three key inter-related features are typically present when there is good financial governance. Firstly, effective financial governance ensures that financial decisions take into account all externalities arising from the decisions. Financial decisions often have consequences that are not fully borne by the decision maker. Financial decisions that may appear rational at the individual level, may in fact be collectively unsustainable. For instance, corrupt practices may be optimal for the individual perspective, but they are clearly detrimental to the welfare of society and the economy. In order to avoid the misallocation of resources, these externalities have to be internalised either by aligning the incentives of the decision maker; introducing a more representative decision-making process; putting in place the appropriate institutional arrangements; having effectively enforced laws, rules and regulations; or occasionally, by societal norms. Secondly, sound financial governance encourages discipline in adhering to the budget constraint. All economic agents are bound by inter-temporal budget constraints, and adherence to it when making financial decisions is key to sustainability. This is particular relevant when the repercussions of financial decisions fall on parties who are not represented – for example, decisions that shift a large debt burden onto future generations. Thirdly, strong financial governance has robust external checks and balances. To ensure sound decision making, especially when externalities are involved, decision makers, and the decision making process, must be subjected to scrutiny by external parties. In this regard, accountability, transparency, and the empowerment of the external party to take consequential action are key to effective financial governance. All these principles apply fully to the management of public finances. Sound public financial governance is the legitimate use of authority in the management of a country’s financial resources with integrity to promote sustainable development. At the heart of it all, sound governance practices in the Government can be traced back to the concept articulated by French Enlightenment political philosopher (Baron de) Montesquieu in the 18th century. The separation of power between the legislative, executive and judicial arms of the government safeguards against authority being excessively centralised in any particular party. It is the effective separation of power that provides the checks and balances that ensure that there is strong financial governance at all levels of government. It is the effective separation of power that ensures that the decision maker not only considers his or her self-interest but also that of the society at large. It is the effective separation of power that ensures that the risk of abuse or misuse of public funds is minimized. Therefore, if you want to know the state of public financial governance in a country, the first question to ask is whether there is effective separation of power. To a great extent, the current state of public finances reflects the past track record of financial governance in the public sector. If the state of fiscal health in the crisis-affected economies had been in a better condition, monetary policy would not have had to do so much heavy lifting, QE may not have seen the light of day, and we may now be having better economic growth. When there is an imbalance in macroeconomic policies, or when such 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  policies are used as substitutes for structural reforms, the long-term outcomes will always be sub-optimal, not least because of the distortions and imbalances that are created. It is certainly the case that the recent crisis has been a key factor behind the increase in government indebtedness. In the aftermath of the crisis, governments in the crisis affected economies had to use public funds to rescue troubled banks. For example, Ireland had a government debt to GDP ratio of just 24% in 2007, but due to its banking crisis and its impact on the Irish economy, that number jumped to 111% by 20113. In fact, even for countries that were not at the centre of the financial crisis, fiscal spending to stimulate domestic demand was increased to offset the negative real sector shock created by the crisis. The low growth environment also reduced the tax revenues of governments, further eroding public finances. So, the crisis certainly played a role in the worsening of public finances. But that is not the complete story. In many countries, public finances were already stretched even before the crisis. This surely says something about the state of financial governance in the public sector of these economies. In the advanced economies, ageing populations and over-generous health and pension benefits were a major source of strained fiscal positions. Although the threat of demographics to fiscal sustainability is at this juncture most imminent for countries such as Japan, Spain, Italy and Greece, where the old age populations are rising most sharply amid already high levels of debt, it is only a matter of time before many emerging market economies will also face similar issues. That includes countries in ASEAN. It is therefore imperative that the public financial governance adequately embed such longer-term considerations into financial decisions being made today. In many emerging market economies that have endowments of resources, the state of financial governance is also reflected in how governments managed the riches that flow from these resource endowments, especially in terms of providing for future generations and saving for bad times. Sadly, there are too many examples of countries that have badly managed their resource wealth. Not only have they failed to save for the future, even their use of the resource wealth has contributed minimally to supporting sustainable economic growth, often because much of that wealth is pillaged by those responsible for its management. The practise of good public financial governance is evidenced not just from the pattern of spending but also from the effectiveness of implementation and the achievement of outcomes. For example, education and talent development is a key priority in many countries, emerging as well as developed. Large amounts of public funds are devoted to education. On the surface, it may look like good financial governance to spend so much money on such a socially and economically desirable objective. Yet, much of that spending goes to waste if there are no accompanying measures to bring about other complementary changes such as raising standards and professionalism, addressing incentives, and ensuring that what is taught meets the needs of the economy. High spending of public funds and the persistence of mediocrity will go hand-in-hand if no one is likely to be held accountable for failure to achieve outcomes. Therefore, good financial governance must be measured in the achievement of specific and measurable outcomes. If the outcomes fall short, then tax-payer money cannot be considered to have been well spent. When there is a lack of financial governance in the public sector, it means that government contracts are awarded based on who you know rather than who can give the best value for the money. As a result, government projects often become costly, poorly delivered and fail to provide the incentives for increased proficiency and productivity. Not only that, a pool of vested interest develops to feed on the lack of financial governance, and any threats to their privileged livelihood are met with great hostility. It is the privileged position of this vested                                                 3  Source: IMF’s Fiscal Monitor Database. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  interest that makes government reform so difficult. The end result is that the intention to have an economy that is driven by efficiency and increasing productivity remains unattainable. There are countries that have gotten it right when it comes to good public financial governance. For resource rich economies, Norway is one example, where since 1990, the government has put aside its oil income in a fund that at the end of 2014 was worth almost US$1 trillion4. The sustainability of the fund has been supported by a fiscal rule that specifies that over the course of the business cycle, the government can only spend the expected real return on the fund but it cannot use any of the fund’s capital. For another example, this time of a country that does not have any significant resource endowments, Singapore is considered to have prudent public financial governance. Again the fiscal rectitude is guided by legal constraints. For example, the country has adopted a legal constraint to balance the budget over the government’s term in office. It also maintains an internal discipline of keeping government spending at below 20% of GDP5. By comparison, most developed countries have government spending at around 40–50% of GDP. So, good public financial governance is possible, assuming there is the political will to put in place the appropriate mechanisms. What about financial governance in the private sector? The financial crisis in the advanced economies and the years since have shown how unsustainable household finances can drag down economic growth for many years. Excessive leverage and high household indebtedness often have negative economic implications. In pondering the issue of financial governance at the individual and household level, I am reminded of Leo Tolstoy’s infamous quote from Anna Karenina, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” There are indeed numerous causes of unhappiness, but being confronted with the consequences of bad financial decisions made in the past must surely be a common cause of much unhappiness among many families. This issue is especially pertinent in the current environment of prolonged low interest rates. Sound financial decisions are needed to ensure that households do not live beyond their means and accumulate excessive debt. This is essential to ensure the sustainable growth in consumption, rather than having debt-fuelled consumption binges followed by prolonged slumps. It is these types of considerations that have made Bank Negara Malaysia maintain a level of interest rates that we believe balances between supporting the economy and discouraging excessive risk taking. This has been supplemented with other policy tools, including macroprudential policies, to manage risks within the financial system and economy. Therefore, it is not only national governments themselves that must practice sound financial governance, they must also promote it as a key priority within the society and not create incentives that lead to unsustainable financial behaviour among economic agents. Turning now to the corporate sector, at the surface, corporate financial governance appears to have ample checks and balances. Management is accountable to boards and boards are accountable to shareholders. For publicly listed companies, there is the market discipline of the share price taking a beating for any perceived shortfalls in financial governance. Unfortunately, history is replete with incidences of the failure of such checks and balances, including the repeated failure of markets to impose financial discipline on corporations. Notable examples of the failure of corporate financial governance include the Carrian Group in 1983, Enron in 2001, Worldcom in 2002, and the numerous examples from the recent financial crisis. The narrow fixation on profit maximisation has, in many cases, led to the                                                 4  Source: https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/the-economy/the-government-pension-fund/market-value-of-the-government-pension-f/id699635/. 5  Source: https://www.mti.gov.sg/AboutMTI/Documents/app.mti.gov.sg/data/pages/507/doc/ERC_Comm_Main-Report_Part2_v2.pdf, page 77. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  misallocation of resources, including the channelling of funds towards unproductive activities for purposes of rent extraction and speculation. This harms economic growth as productive segments are under-invested in. The functioning of markets also needs to be improved. Given the widespread abuse and attempts at manipulation, I believe that appropriate regulations, and their enforcement, can help to ensure that markets function as intended, and support the greater good of society, rather than just the greed and self-interest of the market participants. There is one final aspect of corporate financial governance I would like to mention, and this has to do with what I consider to be one of the biggest threats to future economic growth – environmental sustainability. The damaging effects of activities such as deforestation, over-fishing and excessive emissions on the environment, have wide-ranging implications not just on the future quality of economic activity, but on the quality of life itself. Progress has been made both in terms of regulations and the increased sensitivity of corporations to their environmental footprint. However, the progress is relatively small and developing economies are particularly vulnerable to being made the choice location for the so-called dirty industries. The pursuit of profit is a powerful motivation for corporate existence and unfortunately, it often leads to short-sighted behaviour. The ongoing Volkswagen scandal is a clear example of this. Again, it reinforces the need for sound government regulation in ensuring that financial decisions taken by corporations are not only good for those corporates but also for society as a whole. Let me now move on to the last part of my speech, which relates to the governance of finance. After all, the availability of finance is a key constraint for economic agents and therefore, a key determinant of economic activity. Governance of finance: anchoring finance in the real economy The need to maintain sound financial governance of financial institutions is best demonstrated through the impact of its absence. The recent crisis is a stark reminder that weak financial governance of financial institutions can result in unsustainable levels of leverage, excessive maturity mismatches and underpricing of risk within the financial system, ultimately leading to widespread wealth destruction and economic dislocation. In the US alone, conservative estimates have placed the loss from the financial crisis at between $6 trillion to $14 trillion, or 40 to 90 per cent of the annual economic output6. In response to the global crisis, more extensive international reforms have been pursued to strengthen the financial buffers of financial institutions through, among others, stricter capital and liquidity requirements. These reforms have helped to strengthen the balance sheets of financial institutions and sustained their ability to support orderly financial intermediation. While I acknowledge the importance of these reforms, there is an even more important issue related to the overall “governance of finance”. The financial crisis contains many lessons on how governance of finance failed as well as the consequences of such failure. The governance of finance relates to the behaviour of financial institutions and their determinants from the perspective of organisational arrangements, incentive structures and ethics, as well as the regulatory and market environment. When these factors are correctly aligned, the financial system plays its role in supporting sustainable economic growth; when they are not, the financial system creates risks that can potentially undermine economic growth. Central to the robust governance framework of financial institutions are strong institutional arrangements that provide effective checks and balances to facilitate sound decision-making. At the broadest level, this entails well-defined responsibilities and accountabilities,                                                 6  Luttrell, Atkinson and Rosenblum (2013).

While this may appear to be a rudimentary feature of any governance arrangement, it may be challenging in organisations that are large and have complex or opaque reporting lines, resulting in boards and senior management that are too far removed from the issues on the ground. “Too big to manage” is a real concern. In their reflection of banking practices leading up to the crisis, the United Kingdom’s Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards found that an “unclear, complex and confusing allocation of responsibilities” among senior management had posed challenges in identifying individuals who were responsible for poor decisions and more importantly, in holding them to account7. This is an important lesson to keep in mind for Asia, as our financial institutions continue to significantly expand their operations across sectors and geographical boundaries. In ensuring the effectiveness of governance structures, none is more important than having competent and committed individuals at the helm of financial institutions. The members of the board of directors must have a sound understanding of the business, the risk profile of the financial institution, and the operating environment. The board must also be ready to challenge executive management and hold it to account. This demands a combination of experience, confidence and character – elements which were found lacking among financial institutions in the recent crisis. A Financial Times report in 2008 found that most directors at several large and troubled institutions had no significant experience in financial services8. An undue deference to management by directors was also prevalent in banks such as Northern Rock, HBOS and RBS, where the boards did not adequately challenge the management’s pursuit of aggressive, high-risk strategies. It is for these reasons that Bank Negara Malaysia undertakes rigorous and frequent supervisory engagements with the boards of financial institutions. Such engagements are crucial to developing a better understanding of board dynamics and their effectiveness in their governance role. As a matter of practice, prospective directors of financial institutions in Malaysia are subjected to close scrutiny through rigorous interviews by the Bank. This approach was also recently adopted by the UK’s Prudential Regulatory Authority9. Governance arrangements in financial institutions must also be reinforced by a corporate culture which values and reinforces considerations for risk, ethics and compliance at all levels of the financial institution. This starts with the right “tone from the top”, whereby the board and senior management shape the core values for the firm. A common theme in the findings across various inquiries into the crisis is a breakdown in culture, where a disregard for prudence and ethics was tolerated. In some cases, individuals bearing red flags were not only ignored, but punished. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission launched by the US government chronicles two such instances10. In Lehman Brothers, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) was stripped of her role in risk matters after warning against too much risk in the face of growing pressure to compete against other investment banks. Similarly, repeated warnings raised by the business chief underwriter of Citigroup against large purchases of defective loans did not translate into action; instead, he was downgraded in performance reviews and subsequently demoted. Another major component in the governance of finance is how individual incentives are influenced through compensation. The global financial crisis offers a telling display of how                                                 7  Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (2013).

   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  incentives were misaligned through the widespread adoption of compensation systems that rewarded short-term performance. In the US, loan officers at Washington Mutual were rewarded more for originating higher risk loans, while loan processing personnel were compensated according to the speed and number of loans processed, rather than loan quality. Meanwhile, AIG Financial Products compensated its employees, including risk officers, on the basis of revenues brought in rather than profits. At Lloyds, incentive schemes which pressured sales staff to meet targets or face demotion also encouraged mis-selling of payment protection insurance. In all these instances, executives were inclined to focus on immediate outcomes such as revenues and sales targets in order to deliver visible results quickly, without much regard for the risks assumed. Major efforts have since been undertaken internationally to address these issues. The essence of these reforms is two-pronged: the first is a greater emphasis on the governance of the compensation framework by the board and senior management; the second is a greater alignment of compensation practices with prudent risk-taking. As risks undertaken today may materialise much later in the future, the latter entails deferring portions of compensation and subjecting them to adjustments, such as bonus-malus and clawbacks. Finally, a strengthened role of market discipline can also shape the governance of finance for the better by reducing information asymmetries between the market and financial institutions. Again, regulations can play a part by enhancing the scope and quality of mandatory disclosures, such as in respect of key information relating to risk exposures, risk management policies and capital ratios. A relevant emerging trend among investors and consumers has been an increasing focus on more sustainable approaches to finance, including those which consider environmental, social and governance concerns. For example, large institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds, have started to channel more funds to firms with sustainability commitments. Admittedly, the progress made on this front has been rather modest thus far, but it does have the potential to enable a wider range of stakeholders to determine the sustainability of finance and its role in facilitating sustainable economic growth. Conclusion I have not actually finished my story on the Challenger shuttle disaster at the beginning of my speech. After the harrowing accident, President Reagan formed the Rogers Commission to investigate the incident, and it was found that the accident could have been avoided entirely. The special commission reported that NASA’s organisational culture and decision-making processes were key contributing factors to the catastrophic event. NASA managers had been aware of the potentially fatal flaw in the O-rings since 1977, but did not respond appropriately. And on that fateful morning, warnings from engineers about the risks of launching in the low temperatures were met with contempt, and the superiors were not adequately notified of these technical concerns. Therein lies the importance of governance structures and how decisions are made. Governance influences decisions, and decisions shape outcomes. It is no different for financial governance. Be it financial decisions at the international or national level, public or private, corporates or financial institutions, households or individuals, sound financial governance is the bedrock of stable and robust economies. The fact that a lack of good financial governance increases the likelihood of O-ring-like accidents, with potentially devastating effects on the economy, should make sound financial governance an economic and political priority. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Gent Sejko: The economy and banks, present and future challenges Speech by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the round table on “The economy and banks, present and future challenges”, organised by the Bank of Albania and Government of Albania with the banking system, Tirana, 16 September 2015. *      *      * Your Excellency Prime Minister, Honoured representatives of international institutions, Dear bank executives and representatives, This meeting seeks to once again draw the attention on non-performing loans, an issue that has been discussed extensively over the recent years. It aims at fostering the shared and concrete commitment to reduce the stock of non-performing loans, increase the financial intermediation by the banking sector and underpin Albania’s economic growth. Following, I would like to list some facts. The high level of non-performing loans has not affected the banking sector’s stability. Liquidity and capitalisation indicators remain adequate and the financial performance has been positive and improving. But, the still-high percentage of non-performing loans has contributed to a higher perception of risk by banks; in turn, they have adopted a more conservative approach to lending. Our survey data point to tightened lending standards; meanwhile, the lending volume, albeit positive, is still considered as low. The credit quality has improved during this year. The non-performing loans ratio, after peaking 25%, fell to around 21% in July 2015. We believe this improvement reflects the measures taken in the last 2–3 years, of which I would like to single out: a) Amendments to the law “On income tax” at the end of 2013, to facilitate the loan loss write off from the balance sheet; b) Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedures in September 2013, to improve the collateral execution process; c) Entry into force of a regulation of the Bank of Albania, which renders obligatory the write off of loans classified by banks as “loss” for a period longer than 3 years; d) the work accomplished in cooperation with the commercial banks to restructure loans when the borrowers are exposed to more than one bank; Albeit the number of non-performing loans subject to the execution process has been significantly up, the improvement of the credit quality reflects mainly the loan loss write offs from banks’ balance sheet. For the first half of 2015, its value amounted to around ALL 11 billion. The write off from bank’s balance sheet is both healthy for the bank and useful for the economy, as it: – provides a more realistic picture of the banks’ loan portfolio, releases the capital and improves their financial balance; – improves bank processes, thanks to a more efficient use of human, financial and technical resources, and redirects the focus of the bank toward new loans; – improves the overall functioning of the financial market, as it contributes to the market “exit” of non-competitive businesses. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  – contributes positively to the market participants’ assessment of the banking sector (ratings) and, subsequently, to the assessment of Albania’s economy; – provides conditions to better manage debt collection, but always accompanied with the necessary message that this does not imply forgiving the borrowers debt. In our case, the process of loan loss write off from banks’ balance sheet is not a detached process from real developments. On the contrary, it reflects the gradual improvement in non-performing loans. In concrete terms, over the last two years, the growth rate of non-performing loans has decelerated at extraordinary rates, banks’ annual spending for provisions has fallen, and new loans, especially those denominated in lek, have been stable. On their side, banks have been increasingly committed to this process. Usually, it happens when the effectiveness of the process improves and/or banks expectations for lending improve. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that although the credit quality has improved, the level of non-performing loans is considered as still high, and it should be lowered at a faster pace. This is a complex process that puts to test the adequacy of the legal framework, as well as the coordination and consistent implementation of institutional policies. These challenges were identified in the Annual Forum organised in June. Some of them acknowledge the need for improving the legal framework. Others point to unifying, in a single law, important stipulations about the execution of executive title, which are currently envisaged across several laws. We should be aware that a part of the difficulties arise from the dimensions of this problem; also, until a while ago, the justice system lacked the experience and specialised expertise on these matters and is still facing inadequate capacities to handle such practices. However, inadequate legal provisions and their inconsistent implementation in practice render the collateral execution process tedious, uncertain and costly for the parties involved. The coordination of institutional policies is another key process to respond to various problems in a timely and appropriate fashion. For example, the recent Action Plan for the resolution of non-performing loans represents a new level of communication and commitment of public institutions and the Bank of Albania to find a sustainable solution. Many of the issues concerning the banking industry, which the Bank of Albania considers as crucial, have been incorporated in this Plan. For example, the preparation of the draft law “On bankruptcy”, a commendable effort by the Ministry of Justice represents a significant development and unique opportunity to render the resolution of a financial obligation as an enforceable, predictable, and efficient process. Concluding, I would like to underline that reducing the level of non-performing loans is closely related to the magnitude of financial intermediation by the banking sector. The need to redirect private investments towards new sectors in the economy, the small market size, problems related to the low quality of financial reporting by private entities, and slowdown of economic growth rates in Albania have dictated an unstable private demand for loans . Therefore, it is important to find, in addition to macroeconomic policies, new alternatives to boost domestic demand, promote optimism in the economy and contribute positively to businesses and consumer expectations. The acceleration of economic growth would provide the conditions for faster and steadier improvement in the level of non-performing loans. Thank you! 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, before the Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 23 September 2015. *      *      * Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, During the summer break, our Union faced exceptional challenges. First, there was the long and complicated discussion on the new adjustment programme for Greece. And now, in an area very much outside the ECB’s competence, there is the challenge of harbouring a large number of refugees that had to leave their homes behind. Both these events – although very different in nature – have shown again that Europe can only be strong if it acts in unity on the basis of solidarity and cooperation. This is a lesson we should draw also for the challenges to come. In my remarks today, I would like to discuss two main topics: first, our assessment of the latest economic developments and its implications for our monetary policy stance; second, the proposals my colleagues and I presented in the Five Presidents’ Report. Economic developments and monetary policy Turning to the first topic, let me give you an overview of the economic developments since the last hearing in June. Over the summer, industrial production and other indicators of economic activity showed signs of resilience. At the same time, the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging. Our September macroeconomic projections indicated a weaker economic recovery and a slower increase in inflation rates than we had expected earlier this year. The inflation rate will remain close to zero in the very near term, before rising again towards the end of the year. It will take somewhat longer than previously anticipated for it to converge back to and stabilise around levels that we consider sufficiently close to 2%. Slowing growth in emerging market economies, a stronger euro and the fall in oil prices and in commodity prices more generally are the main causes for these developments. As a result, renewed downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation have emerged. For many of these changes, it is too early to judge with sufficient confidence whether they will cause lasting slippage from the trajectory that we initially expected inflation to follow when we decided to expand our asset purchase programme in January. More time is needed to determine in particular whether the loss of growth momentum in emerging markets is of a temporary or permanent nature and to assess the driving forces behind the drop in the international price of commodities and behind the recent episodes of severe financial turbulence. We will therefore monitor closely all relevant incoming information and its impact on the outlook for price stability. Our monetary policy measures in place, including the TLTROs, continue to have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. They have so far prevented a measurable tightening in financial conditions for the real economy despite the recent surge in financial volatility. The sustained decline in the cost of borrowing is strengthening domestic demand, by supporting durable goods consumption and stimulating investment particularly by small and medium-sized businesses. This is making the euro area economy more resistant to external shocks. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Should some of the downwards risks weaken the inflation outlook over the medium term more fundamentally than we project at present, we would not hesitate to act. The asset purchase programme has sufficient in-built flexibility. We will adjust its size, composition and duration as appropriate, if more monetary policy impulse should become necessary. I am aware that many of you closely scrutinise the potential effect of the low interest rate environment on financial stability; ECON coordinators chose this as one of the topics for today. Building on what I said during the hearing in March, let me underline that we are closely monitoring risks to financial stability, but we do not see them materialising for the moment. Should this be the case, macroprudential policy – not monetary policy – would be the tool of choice to address these risks. Here, we can build on the recent experience in developing these tools: over the last two years, national authorities in Europe have been active in introducing macroprudential policies, such as caps on loan-to-value or debt-to-income ratios to structurally strengthen the mortgage market and to counter growth in real estate prices as well as mortgage loans. Similarly, to strengthen the banking system, countries have introduced systemic risk buffers, in addition to the buffers for globally systemic banks and other important institutions. However, these macroprudential instruments mainly cover lending through the banking sector. As there are signs that the financing of the euro area economy has tended to shift to non-banks, the coverage of the macroprudential framework needs to start being extended to the shadow banking sector so as to address risks in the financial sector as a whole. I would also like to say a few words about Greece. During the last hearing in June, I called for a comprehensive and fair agreement with Greece. In the following weeks, coming to such an agreement was very difficult and necessitated tremendous efforts from all those involved. But I am grateful that in the end, an agreement was reached. If it is completely implemented, the new programme will put Greece in a position to grow again and to reap the full benefits of participating in our common currency. The ECB contributed, in line with the provisions laid out in the legal framework, to the negotiation of the programme. In addition, the ECB closely monitored the provision of emergency liquidity assistance by the Bank of Greece according to our rules, taking into account the prospect of a successful completion of the negotiations at any point in time. Completing EMU: following up on the Five Presidents’ Report The negotiations over the summer revealed again the fact that our institutional framework is still not commensurate with the requirements of sharing one currency. In the Five Presidents’ Report that we published shortly after the last hearing, the five authors shared one common conviction, namely that to make monetary union stable and prosperous, a more complete union is necessary. But we did not only outline this common conviction; we also presented a concrete roadmap showing how to attain this objective. This roadmap should now guide our discussions in the months to come. From our perspective, two elements are of particular importance. First, despite the best efforts of all actors involved, the crisis has shown that monetary union requires a political centre; a centre that can take the relevant fiscal, economic and financial decisions for the euro area as a whole in a swift and transparent manner with full democratic legitimacy and a clear set of responsibilities given to it by the legislators. It is in this spirit that I have called repeatedly for a move from rules-based coordination to sharing of sovereignty within common institutions. The report proposes a euro area treasury as one example. Such ideas now need to be spelled out. But we should also go further with regard to our policies. The report makes clear that EMU will also need to strengthen its tools to manage and prevent the build-up of fiscal, financial and other macroeconomic risks. In the last few years, notably with the reforms strengthening the economic governance framework and setting up the ESM, SSM and SRM, we have 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  made important first steps in improving our crisis prevention and crisis management toolkit. But we are not there yet. Most imminently, we should move towards completing banking union through a common backstop for the Single Resolution Fund and through a European deposit insurance scheme. Both are essential to create a truly single banking system to mirror our single currency, and both are crucial to underpin the credibility of banking union and finally achieve its initial promise, namely breaking the bank-sovereign nexus, making the financial system more resilient, and protecting the interests of taxpayers. At the same time – going beyond the confines of the banking sector and banking union – we must make progress in developing a capital markets union to enhance further the scope for cross-border private risk-sharing. In addition, we need to prevent imbalances – whatever their nature – from developing into a crisis environment. Therefore, we need a new convergence process based on the capacity of our economies to withstand shocks and grow out of them quickly. This would imply not only a more robust financial system as just described, but also stronger governance over structural reforms and a tighter control of national fiscal policies. To ensure that Member States can adjust to shocks, whatever their size, we will also need to add a layer of fiscal stabilisation at the European level. Taken together, these steps towards completing EMU would help to make the euro area not only survive, but thrive and prosper. On that note, I am now looking forward to your questions. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Pentti Hakkarainen: Economic outlook Presentation by Mr Pentti Hakkarainen, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Finland, to the YIT group and division management boards, Lahti, 17 September 2015. *      *      * The slides can be found at the Bank of Finland website Slides 1.  Global economy The world economy is growing, albeit a bit slower than it was expected a year ago. The economic outlook in the United States has remained encouraging and the Euro area prospects have clearly improved.  However last August was a bumby month for financial markets. Stock markets around the world were infected by the Chinese stock market crash. The crash was preceded by the Shanghai composite index more than doubling in the course of little less than a year. The stock market bubble burst in two phases: in June and in August. First phase had little effect globally, but in August, the crash spread around the major stock exchanges causing turmoil. Since then, the situation has somewhat stabilized. Volatility has remained high, but around a new – and lower – level. Also raw material prices have decreased, partly reflecting the impaired economic outlook in China. In oil markets, the supply side is also partly to be blamed for. Oil supply has remained solid despite the price collapse.  What did stock market volatility and falling raw material prices reflect? One answer is that these illustrated at least partially the uneven progress of the world economy. Especially the general assessments on Chinese growth prospects have been revised down. Situation in China has also increased downward risks for other emerging market economies.  Growth moderation in China is caused by the change in its economic structure. Currently the economy is undergoing a phase shift with the share of household consumption increasing. In 2012, the share of consumption to GDP was just 35 % which is low by all standards. For example in the United States, household consumption makes roughly 70 % of GDP. This shift will take time. Bank of Finland’s forecast for Chinese GDP growth in 2016 is 6 %. And that is still a very good number.  2.  Euro area  Euro area economy has been doing better for some time. Total production is increasing in the four biggest Euro area economies; Germany, France, Italy and Spain. In the first half of 2015, Euro area economy grew 0,5 % in the first quarter and 0,4 % in the second. Especially Spain has been growing rapidly after all the hard years it has lived through.  In Euro area, unemployment is slowly declining, although from high levels. Improved employment, lowered oil price and low interest rates have increased household real income and consumption. In the corporate sector, investments have been supported by accommodative monetary policy and improving financial conditions. Although investments have been very low for a long time, there is finally some positive signs available. Looking at the European Central Bank Staff projections from September, Euro area GDP growth rate is projected to pick up from 1,4 % in 2015 to 1,8 % in 2017. Inflation is projected to be 0,1 %in 2015, and gradually increase to 1,1 % in 2016 and to 1,7 % in 2017. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3.  Russia Russian economy has faced economic headwinds. The largest impact has come from the fall of the oil price that occurred since the middle of 2014. This illustrates the dependence of the economy on exports of oil, oil products as well as gas. A decreasing oil price easily puts the exchange rate on a downward slide. That has been the case also in Russia.  The fall of the oil price also has pushed down domestic demand in Russia this year. This has pressed the GDP to a level that in the second quarter was 4.6 % lower than one year earlier. There are signs that the slide may have stopped. However, for example the Bank of Russia in its latest forecast projects that this year the decline of the GDP will amount to 3.9–4.4, if the oil price stays at slightly below 50 dollars per barrel for the rest of the year. Similar to the crisis of 2009, Russia’s imports have fallen significantly this year, reacting strongly both to diminishing domestic demand and the weakening of the rouble. In terms of their value in euros, imports of goods and services into Russia fell by 20 % in the first half of this year from the first half of 2014. Expectations about the fall of the import volume for the entire year 2015 range between 20 and 30 %. Regarding another burden, GDP growth in Russian slowed down already years earlier befor oil price declined and sanctions due to geopolitical tensions. This slowdown reflected the economy’s systemic shortfalls like low level of fixed investments. This is naturally the fundamental burden when thinking about the future, about Russia’s growth perspectives in a longer term. 4.  Finland Finland is falling further behind euro area growth. According to the last Bank of Finland forecast from June 2015, Finland will not catch up with the pace of recovery in the other euro area countries.  Economic growth in Finland has been slow for a prolonged period, both historically and by international comparison. Finnish exports have suffered a considerable loss of market share since 2009, the most severe year of the recession.  Growth has been depressed by sectoral and structural problems. The forest industries and electrical engineering and electronics, in particular, have experienced serious difficulties. Also an ageing population and lackluster productivity development have weakened the growth potential. In addition, Finnish export growth remains subdued partially because of the weak performance of the Russian economy.  During the first half of the year the growth rate of the Finnish economy has been pulled to mildly positive territory mainly due to global economic developments. These include oil price developments and low interest rates and the Euro area recovery. However, there are headwinds to a more robust recovery. In addition to the structural factors mentioned above, factors such as weak competitiveness, labour market matching problems, and lacking implementation of planned structural reforms hamper growth in Finland. The labour market situation has deteriorated rapidly during the past year. Unemployment is now higher than in the recession year 2009, the unemployment rate standing at 9.6 % in July. The employment rate is falling. The rise in unemployment has been widespread, affecting all age groups, although especially the rise in youth unemployment has accelerated during the first half of the year.  Over the past 5 years there has been a soft, if lengthy landing in the Finnish housing market, reflecting the protracted economic downturn. The housing loan cycle in Finland is now passing its second trough after the burst of the global financial crisis. There can be a strong regional divergence in house prices and household indebtedness within countries, too. These regional differences are driven by both demand and supply-side 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  factors. Growth areas are typically characterised by increasing population, younger residents, a better employment situation and higher household income than the national average. This is also reflected in brisker housing markets and higher house prices in these areas. For example, in Finland the market conditions in the metropolitan areas are diverging from the conditions prevailing in areas where the population is diminishing. The largest housing loans are concentrated in the biggest cities and growth centres. In these centres, house prices are also highest. Ladies and gentlemen, let me know draw main conclusions: • The US economy is growing and today we will hear from the Fed OMC-meeting how strong the growth is, and also we will hear whether monetary policy stance needs to be changed. • Emerging market economies have had difficult times; e.g. Brazil and Russia have faced strong headwinds and China’s growth is levelling off. • Growth outlook for Europe has improved, unfortunately Finnish economy has not recovered accordingly and our economy requires tough medicine to cure its worsened and dire competitive position. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Christian Noyer: Monetary and financial research – its impact on policies and society Opening and closing speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Conference for the 20th anniversary of the Bank of France Foundation, Paris, 14 September 2015. *      *      * Opening speech Ladies and Gentlemen, I will now switch to English, given the international audience and speakers that we are quite lucky to have today. I would first of all like to express the great pleasure I have to open this conference for the twentieth anniversary of the Banque de France Foundation for Monetary, banking and financial economic research. I welcome the prominent speakers who made us the honor of joining us today – Yann Algan from Sciences Po in Paris and Luigi Zingales from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business – and all our chairs and discussants who also are renowned economists in their respective fields. A few words about the topic of this conference now. The idea of this conference is to take a step back and some time to reflect on monetary and financial research in general, and its impact on policies and society. We will thus evoke the role of economics and economists within our society. The two provocative papers discussed today provide a very nice opportunity for such a discussion. They both point out several concerns about economic research and finance. They highlight the tendencies of economists to be self-referential and analyze how the social perception of the finance industry is largely negative nowadays, and the more so since the financial crisis. In that respect, the paper focuses on the United States, but there is little doubt that France probably is no exception to that rule either. After the 2007–2008 crisis, some first steps have been taken to change incentives in the financial industry. And even more should be done in that direction in the coming years. At the same time, economists should also adopt a more critical view on the financial industry practices and judge them as impartially as possible. But what can we say about economists themselves? Are they really too self-referential and do they tend to overestimate their role in society? On a personal note – as a policymaker and central banker – I do believe it is possible that central bank governors may pay the cost of the so-called “superiority” of economists (for instance when they are too sure of their econometric models). How will we proceed in this conference today? In-depth discussion of papers will be left to participants. However, I would like to mention the potential role that the Foundation can play to help address some important issues. First, economic analysis is definitely needed in order to sharpen policy makers’ understanding of the world. At the same time, policy makers should continuously challenge the alleged “superiority” of economists with the complexity of the real world. Second, actions need to be taken to get academia more involved in policymaking, to bring the discipline of theory-based analyses to the policy debates. That implies a better access to governmental data for academic researchers, to enable them to conduct independent and 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  rigorous research and expose their results to policymakers and the general public, who should listen to them in return. Well, I hope this is no wishful thinking and I will now leave the floor to our distinguished speakers. Thank you. ***** Closing speech To close today’s conference, I would like to come back to the Foundation and its role. I will focus on a brief historical overview of the Foundation for Monetary, banking and financial economic research. A lot has been achieved since 1995, as you know. What was our goal? To promote excellence in academic research in the field of monetary policy and finance. And did we achieve it so far? Well, over three hundred conferences and seminars have been sponsored. The research grant program has also awarded 81 grants for about 2.4 million euros in total. While it is difficult to identify the potential outcome of projects at an early stage, the program has been rewarded by excellent outcomes. Most papers were published in the best international research journals. Yet not just academic successes were achieved. Some papers were also financed by the Foundation and later became hot policy topics, sometimes with very good insight. For instance, I think of a paper by Freixas, Parigi and Rochet on “Systemic Risk, Interbank Relationships and Liquidity Provision by the Central Bank” published in 2000 in the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking (JMCB). In 2000, that is eight years before the crisis. And yet the paper already underlined the importance of interbank relationships in the spread of risk. Some trends and evolutions in research in economics and in the work of central banks over the last twenty years were also identified and discussed. Obviously globalization and international links have played an ever more important role in monetary and financial economics (including with the creation of the euro for instance). There were also changes in economic research, as more attention was progressively given to actual policy-making. One of the leading examples is perhaps the so-called Taylor rule, which was created to describe the actual behavior of central bankers. This allowed a much richer interaction between academia and policy makers. Changes also affected policy-making, with more attention paid to academic debates. These even influenced the very structure of central banks. Research units were put into place and developed in most major central banks, including the Banque de France, which also implemented an External Evaluation of Research (EER). Central bankers indeed realized the importance of conducting their own research activities to support policy making. Heavier use of theoretical findings and data-based analysis was made, in order for central banks to better articulate their policy actions. Also, economic research outside central banks – which is not driven by direct “daily” topics – proved ultimately valuable for policy too. For example, some ideas developed in Krugman (1998) and Eggertson & Woodford (2003) on policy at the Zero Lower Bound, inspired by the economic stagnation in Japan, entered the United States and Euro Area policy debates years after their publication. The Banque de France Foundation has accompanied all these significant trends. By fostering research conducted by international teams. By sponsoring research unrelated to immediate Banque de France needs, but which would ultimately prove beneficial for our policies. In that respect, I do expect that the Foundation will still play an important role in the next decade in promoting excellence in research in the field of monetary and financial economics. I also hope – and this will be my conclusion – that this is no wishful thinking either. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Once again, let me thank all the participants, speakers, discussants and chairs that have joined us today for such fruitful talks and congratulate the young researchers who received a well-deserved prize for their work.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Raghuram Rajan: Sustainable growth in the financial sector – 2015 C K Prahalad Lecture Speech by Dr Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 4th D K Prahalad Memorial Lecture, Mumbai, 18 September 2015. *      *      * Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad was born in Tamil Nadu. One of nine children, he obtained an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Madras and went on to a diploma at IIM, Ahmedabad as a member of the first graduating batch. He followed that with a DBA from Harvard Business School in 1975. Prahalad started his academic career at the University of Michigan in 1977, and in 1990, he and Gary Hamel co-authored an article in the Harvard Business Review titled, “The Core Competence of the Corporation.” In this influential article, building on the work of Edith Penrose who first stressed the importance of the unique capabilities of a firm, Prahalad and Hamel encouraged corporate executives to “identify, cultivate, and exploit the core competencies that make growth possible.” In their 1994 book, Competing for the Future, Prahalad and Hamel analyzed how established market leaders like IBM tend to lose ground to innovative upstarts like Apple – IBM failed to see the future of the personal computer because it was too focused on maintaining its leadership in the mainframe business. Perhaps most important to India, Prahalad’s 2005 book, The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits, explored how businesses might pursue sustainable growth while catering to the poorest of the poor. Indeed, much as the term “core competence”, the term “the bottom of the pyramid” has entered the common lexicon. He received many awards and honors during his life time, but perhaps the greatest honor is the continuing influence of his work. I met C.K. Prahalad when I was at the University of Chicago. Despite his enormous reputation and the exalted circles he moved in, he was always down to earth, and immensely insightful. He cared deeply about India, and gave freely of his time and money to make a difference here. Many of you have attended the seminars he organized to improve Indian business practice. He believed we Indians could be second to none; some of the businessmen here have taken his message to heart and delivered. He and I never got a chance to do research together, but we did write a joint letter to the then Prime Minister in 2009, together with Abhijit Banerjee, advocating, among other steps, accelerated efforts to bring out a unique ID in India. Perhaps, therefore, we all had a small role in the Prime Minister setting up the Unique ID Authority, headed by Nandan Nilekani. As an aside, given how far Nandan’s UIDAI has taken us towards a universal unique identity for India, it would be sad if its use were severely restricted. Other countries like the United States have used unique IDs, such as social security numbers, without serious allegations of violations of privacy. Learning from worldwide experience, we need to see how we can satisfy the concerns of the Supreme Court without undermining the value of the unique ID. The unique ID can enable a variety of economically valuable activities that particularly benefit the bottom of the pyramid. For instance, not only can UIDs expand the access of the poor and young to credit as they borrow against the collateral of their future good name, it will also allow the regulator to detect and curb over-lending to individuals by asking lenders to report the IDs of borrowers to credit bureaus. Today, unscrupulous lenders can avoid current regulations against over-lending by simply misreporting the borrower’s name or address. Similarly, the Government has used UIDs to weed out duplicate beneficiaries for various welfare schemes, allowing better targeting of scarce funds to the very poor. I think C.K. would want us to find a way to move forward with UIDs. I do believe, as C.K. did, that India can be far more successful and influential than it is today. What do we need to do to succeed? How can we compete effectively against the best? Do we need to identify our core 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  competencies as a nation? Rather than attempt to speak from the perspective of business, let me speak from the vantage point of a central banker. Let me also quickly offer my standard disclaimer: For any hints on what we will do in the upcoming policy statement, please read the guidance in our last policy statement. I quote: “Significant uncertainty will be resolved in the coming months, including the likely persistence of recent inflationary pressures, the full monsoon outturn, as well as possible Federal Reserve actions. As the Reserve Bank awaits greater transmission of its front-loaded past actions, it will monitor developments for emerging room for more accommodation.” Nothing I say in what follows is meant to offer further guidance, and please don’t read veiled meaning where none is intended. If we look around the world today, it does not present a pretty picture. Industrial countries are still struggling, with a few exceptions, to grow. Our fellow BRICS all have deep problems. Indeed, India appears to be an island of relative calm in an ocean of turmoil. What is different and how can we be assured that it will continue? A lesson from Brazil? Perhaps Brazil offers a salutary lesson. Only a few years ago, the world was applauding the country’s thriving democracy, its robust economic growth, and the enormous strides it was making in reducing inequality. It grew at 7.6 percent in 2010, and had discovered huge oil reserves which the then President Lula likened to “winning a lottery ticket”. Yet the country is expected to shrink by 3 percent this year, and its debt just got downgraded to junk. What went wrong? Paradoxical as it may seem, Brazil tried to grow too fast. The 7.6 percent growth came on the back of substantial stimulus after the global financial crisis. In an attempt to keep growth high, the New York Times says the central bank was pressed to reduce interest rates, fuelling a credit spree that overburdened customers are now struggling to repay.1 Further, Brazil’s government funded development bank hugely increased subsidized loans to corporations. Certain industries were favored with tax breaks while price controls were imposed on gasoline and electricity, causing huge losses in public sector firms. Petrobras, the national oil company, which was supposed to make enormous investments in oil drilling, instead became embroiled in a corruption scandal. Even as government pensions burned an ever larger hole, budget deficits expanded, and the political consensus to narrow them has become elusive. Towards sustainable growth While the Brazilian authorities are working hard to rectify the situation, let us not ignore the lessons their experience suggests. Growth has to be obtained in the right way. It is possible to grow too fast with substantial stimulus, as we did in 2010 and 2011, only to pay the price in higher inflation, higher deficits, and lower growth in 2013 and 2014. Of course, India is not in the same situation today. But with the world being an inhospitable place, we have to work hard to strengthen our current recovery and put it on a more sustainable footing. And while monetary policy will accommodate to the extent there is room, we will expand sustainable growth potential only by continuing to implement reforms the government and regulators have announced. These are intended to strengthen the environment for doing business and to expand access to financing, and these will then in turn allow our companies to find and exploit their core competencies.                                                 1  “As a Boom Fades, Brazilians Wonder How it all Went Wrong”, Simon Romero, New York Times, September 11, 2015. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  For the RBI, the key tasks are to keep inflation low not just today but well into the future so that we get moderate nominal interest rates that satisfy not just the vocal borrowers but also the silent savers. We also need to clean up the banking system of distressed assets so that it is in a position to fund growth again. While we understand the difficulties industry has and will work as hard as we can on improving the environment, India must resist special interest pleas for targeted stimulus, additional tax breaks and protections, directed credit, subventions and subsidies, all of which have historically rendered industry uncompetitive, government over-extended, and the country incapable of regaining its rightful position amongst nations. Belief What will be critical in success, as the Prime Minister said earlier this month while meeting industrialists and bankers, is that business has to believe in the tremendous possibilities and opportunities the nation has, and be willing to take the investment risks that will generate returns. No country succeeds without believing in itself – I do not mean the unwarranted belief that we are intrinsically better than everyone else but the confidence that given our population, our demographics, our massive infrastructure investment opportunities, and the wide range of capabilities in our people, the arc of history is turning towards us. While Indian business has been hurt by public authorities’ acts of omission and commission in the past, it has to look forward. And I have no doubt that as business presses people in positions of public responsibility to make the changes needed to ease doing business, we will respond. What specifically are we doing on the environment in the financial sector and what more do we need to do? Let me turn to that, dwelling specifically on the need to foster competition and innovation, on creating an environment hospitable to those who do not belong to the club, on improving the structures we have to deal with distress, and on strengthening human capital in the financial system. Fostering competition and Innovation In order to get sustained growth, we need more competition, especially from new entrants who are in a better position to reach hitherto excluded parts of our economy. After a decade of no new entry, we will see two new private banks this year, and a large number of payment banks and small finance banks next year. Licensing is likely to go on tap. Incumbents have expressed fears about unfair competition. Competition is only unfair if it is not on the same playing field. In fact, new entrants have no privileges that incumbents do not already enjoy. We hope, though, that the new entrants will find innovative ways of giving customers better services at lower prices, thus shaking up and changing the banking sector for the better. Regulators are naturally a conservative lot. It is good we are that way else there would be no speed breakers in the economy to slow its propensity to get into trouble. But we also should not stand in the way of innovation. There is a Chinese saying: “Cross the river by feeling the stones”. We have tried to follow that path of experimentation and incremental liberalization. So, for example, as increasingly innovative new services want their customers to have the ability to make payments quickly, we have allowed small value card payments without two-factor authentication. As we and financial institutions gain experience, and as new technologies ensuring security emerge, we can liberalize further. More generally, our philosophy is to allow innovation in institutions, instruments and practices so long as they do not present a clear and present danger. Once we understand them better, and they grow to a material size, we can do a deeper analysis on how they should be regulated. Similarly, we have been allowing more and more participation in derivative markets by what are typically known as speculators – those without an underlying risk they are hedging. Speculators are much maligned in India and often confused with market manipulators. The 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  two are different. Speculators take positions in an instrument and thus take risks, much as an investor in a stock takes risk. They typically take the necessary other side to hedgers. Without speculators, there would be little depth in most markets and prices would be distorted. The market manipulator moves thin markets in a preferred direction so as to make a quick profit, in contrast to the speculator who simply takes a side she thinks will make money. In the securities we regulate, we intend to encourage broader participation while discouraging manipulation. More generally, we would like to improve regulation by focusing on what is absolutely necessary to create a sound business environment – focusing on enabling regulation rather than paternalistic regulation – while increasing enforcement of what is on the books. We will trust but we will also verify. To this end we are streamlining all our regulations by the end of the year into new Master Documents which will be placed on the Internet and updated on a real time basis, so that any regulated entity can know quickly the gamut of what is required when undertaking an action. Including outsiders As India grows, financial sector participants will grow beyond the insiders who typically dominate economic activity in the early stages of growth in every country. Outsiders and new entrants will want access, arm’s length contracts that they can trust, and a dispute settlement system that is transparent and predictable. Start first with access. We need to bring more of the hitherto excluded to participate in the financial system. The Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojana has created accounts for much of the excluded population. Government has taken the next step of attaching a variety of financial services such as accident and life insurance to these accounts, and sending Direct Benefits such as scholarships, pensions, and subsidies to these accounts. We also have to ease access to bank accounts through Business Correspondents, payment banks, and point-of-sales machines so that they are used frequently. Easy payments, access to cash-in and cash-out facilities, and widespread availability of safe savings instruments have to be our next objectives in the financial inclusion of households. We also need to ease lending to small producers, whether they are farmers, Self Help Groups, or businesses. For this, we need to improve the structure and working of credit information bureaus, collateral registries, and debt recovery tribunals – ironically, credit flows easily only when the lender is persuaded that he will get his money back, so easier access to credit necessitates harsher consequences of default. Perhaps the most important source of collateral value is land. We need better digital mapping and clean records of land ownership across the country so that land can be used more effectively as collateral. Newcomers and outsiders rely, not on relationships to get things done, but on arm’s length auctions and contracts, enforced quickly by an impartial bureaucracy and judiciary. The clean-up that is taking place in methods of allocating resources like mines and spectrum, and the attempts to improve the speed of bureaucratic and judicial decision making are all much needed to increase participation, though much more has to be done over time. Any reforms have to be institutionalized, so that they outlive the reformer’s passing. Finally, newcomers and outsiders need protection against unfair practices. As one example of what we are doing, RBI has developed a Charter of Consumer Rights following public consultation. Bank boards have been asked to put in place frameworks that ensure those rights are protected. After those frameworks have been in operation for some time, RBI will take a view on best practices, and regulation, if any is needed. In the meantime, field visits by RBI, to check mis-selling as well as the proper functioning of bank infrastructure such as branches and ATMs, will be expanded. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Resolution of distress Failure is inevitable in a free enterprise system. An effective resolution system is needed to preserve residual enterprise value after financial failure. Two critical elements are the speed of resolution and the predictability of how losses are shared amongst contracts. For instance, few outsiders will want to lend if they believe they will be subordinated to promoter interests in bad times. So we need a speedy bankruptcy code to resolve distress while maintaining the priority structure of claims, and I am glad the Finance Ministry intends to bring one in soon. The bankruptcy code will give creditors more ability to resolve distress, and help strengthen the corporate bond market, which is so essential to infrastructure financing. In the meantime, we have to find ways to deal with the distress in the banking system. Regulatory forbearance, where RBI softens its rules on classifying bad loans, only makes it easy for banks to “extend and pretend”. It is not a solution. Since no other stake-holder – such as the promoter, tariff authorities, tax authorities, etc. – contributes to resolution, the real project limps along, becoming increasingly unviable. Meanwhile, analysts grow increasingly suspicious of bank balance sheets and the growing volume of “restructured” assets. Also, some large promoters take advantage of banker fears about assets turning non-performing to extract unwarranted concessions, without any sacrifice in the value of their stake. Regulatory forbearance therefore ensures that problems grow until the size of the provisioning required to deal with the problem properly becomes alarmingly large – which then prompts calls for yet more forbearance. Forbearance is also a disservice to the bank’s owners (which may include the Government) who, instead of being faced with a small problem early and being given the opportunity to apply corrective action, are faced with large problems suddenly when they cannot be pushed into the future any more. RBI ended the forbearance accorded to restructured loans. Henceforth, restructured loans will be classified as non-performing loans. However, RBI has made it easier to recognize and deal with distressed projects. In other words, while ending forbearance, we have introduced flexibility for those who recognize and deal with stressed assets early – the early warning database of large loans, the Joint Lenders’ Forum, the Strategic Debt Restructuring process, the 5/25 mechanism, and so on should all be seen as RBI’s way of giving banks the flexibility to deal with the stressed asset problem in the absence of a functioning bankruptcy code, even while bringing more urgency and discipline to dealing with the problem. Naturally, some criticise our easing the way for restructuring. One gentleman accosted me the other day and asked why, when he was paying his debt regularly, his competitor who had siphoned money out of the firm through over-invoicing was getting his debt written down because it was unpayable. The reality is that firms have got into trouble for a variety of reasons, only one of which is over-invoicing. Wherever possible, of course, promoters should share fully in the costs of restructuring. But the restructuring process is not meant to deal with criminality. Siphoning money out of a business is a crime against lenders and investors, and should be dealt with as such by the investigative authorities. However, the original sin of over-invoicing should not be a reason to keep idle a spanking new plant and to let its workers go. Developing human capital The country needs many more finance professionals with specific skills for the enormous financing needs that lie ahead. Today, for example, too many of our project decisions are made by banks listening to the same set of consultants, which means that too few independent views get embedded in the evaluation decision. Ironically, the same consultants who advised on the project initiation are also called in when the project goes bad. Banks need to have these skills in-house so they are not forced to follow the herd. This problem is most apparent in public sector banks, though private banks are not immune. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The quick way is for our public sector banks to recruit the needed talent in the short run from the market. While the challenges of making a mark in the public sector may attract some to the top public sector bank positions, for subordinate positions it may be essential to pay a market wage. That cost will be small when set against the enormous national benefit of banks making better decisions. Of course, the bulk of public sector promotions will continue to come from in-house talent. Also, poaching talent from other banks is a zero sum game for the system. Therefore, our banks will have to develop skills in-house by training staff – not so much in soft skills such as leadership but hard skills such as risk management capabilities. In our development role, the RBI has to help strengthen the human capital in the financial system. Some of our teaching units such as the College of Agriculture and Banking and the Staff College have been training bankers in important areas such as agricultural lending and MSME lending. Increasingly, our Center for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) will provide courses in state of the art financial techniques such as project evaluation, structuring and resolution of distress as well as risk management. Banks may want to pool resources to set up other such facilities, or press CAFRAL to expand its offerings. Conclusion These are some of the ways I think we can position the financial system towards sustainable growth. Before I end, let me try to answer one last question. In the same way as firms have core competencies, do countries have core competencies? Perhaps they do. But it is very hard for public authorities to determine what they are in the face of massive lobbying and disinformation from interested parties. If we say we want to focus on national core competencies, every industry will be out to show why it thoroughly fits the bill – in the same way as every industry today wants to tell us why they especially deserve special tax benefits or interest subventions. Remember, the License Permit Raj persisted precisely because some industries were favoured over others in the so-called national interest. So even if nations have core competencies, it will be very hard to determine what they are, and very easy to succumb to vested interests in supporting the wrong ones. Better to focus on creating an enabling environment, and let the core competencies emerge from the fillip given by the environment – much as the IT sector emerged as a result of the investment the country made in technical education, but without specific encouragement by the government. Let me conclude. CK Prahalad believed Indian business was capable of scaling world heights and so do I. But there are no easy paths to the top. Jugaad or “working around” difficulties by hook or by crook is a thoroughly Indian way of coping but it is predicated on a difficult or impossible business environment. And it encourages an attitude of short cuts and evasions, none of which help final product quality or sustainable economic growth. While we should respect the entrepreneurial abilities of our business people in difficult environments, it is better for us to change the environment for the better. That is indeed what we are trying to do. All this requires patience. The current difficulties of emerging markets stem from a complicated set of reasons, but an important one is impatience to regain growth by overemphasizing old and ineffective methods of stimulus. Brazil may have overspent, China may have overinvested. The world is a difficult place. Let us recognize we are doing quite well in comparison – indeed, many industries in difficulty have a problem because exports are low or imports are very competitive, and not because domestic demand is inordinately weak. We cannot compensate entirely for what is happening across our borders, else we will risk acquiring the problems our fellow emerging markets have. We have to have the discipline to stick to our strategy of building the necessary institutions and creating a new path of sustainable growth where Jugaad is no longer needed. For this, we need the 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  understanding and cooperation of business, not impatience and pressure for quick impossible fixes. Only then can we realize our true potential as a nation. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Glenn Stevens: Overview of recent economic developments in Australia Opening statement by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Canberra, 18 September 2015. *      *      * Chair Members of the Committee Thank you for the opportunity to meet with you today. The Australian economy continues to progress through a major adjustment, in the midst of testing international circumstances. The terms of trade have been falling for four years and have declined by a third since their peak – though that was a very, very high peak. They are now back to about the same level as in 2006 – still about 30 per cent above their 20th century average level. Resources sector capital spending has been following the terms of trade with a lag. From an extraordinarily high peak – at about 8 per cent of GDP, nearly three times the peaks seen in most previous upswings – this investment has been falling for about two and a half years. By the time it is finished, this decline will probably total something like 5 per cent of GDP. We are probably now about halfway through the decline. It is having a predictable impact on those industries and regions that had earlier experienced the effects of the boom. Resources sector exports have risen strongly as the greater capacity resulting from all the investment has been put to use. Australia now exports around three times the volume of iron ore that it did a decade ago, and around twice as much coal. A very large rise in exports of natural gas is in prospect over the next few years. Outside the mining sector and parts of the economy most directly exposed to it, there are signs that conditions have been very gradually improving. Survey-based measures of business conditions have been a bit above their longer-run average levels for some time now, and the most recent readings are about where they were in 2010. A few of the non-mining sectors have shown quite marked improvements over the past twelve months. To this we can add that the overall number of job vacancies in the economy has been increasing, even as employment opportunities in mining and some other areas diminish. The increase has not been rapid, but nonetheless the trend has clearly been upward for about two years. Since this time last year, moreover, we have seen a rise of about 200 000, or about 2 per cent, in employment. The labour force participation rate and the ratio of employment to population have both started to increase. The rate of unemployment, though variable from month to month, seems to have stopped rising, and it is at a level a bit lower than we had thought, six months ago, it might reach. Of course, this performance is not uniform geographically or by industry. The two large south-eastern states show the largest increases in demand and employment, and dwelling prices, while conditions elsewhere are more subdued. By industry, the rise in employment has been strongest in services, especially those types of services delivered to households, though business services activities have also added to employment over the past year. Monetary policy is seeking to support this transition, something it can do because inflation remains low. Very low interest rates, coupled with financial institutions wanting to lend, have played a part in the improvement in conditions in some sectors. Residential construction is running at very high levels, households are adding a little less of their incomes to savings and savers have been searching for higher returns. These are all indications of easy money at work. Cognisant of the risk that very low interest rates may foster a worrying debt build-up, regulatory initiatives are in place to maintain sound lending standards and capital adequacy. I 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  hasten to add that the objective of such tools is not to control dwelling prices, but to contain leverage. The evidence is emerging that they are doing their job. More recently, the significant decline in the exchange rate is starting to have more discernible effects on the pattern of spending and production. The decline over the past two years amounts to about 25 per cent against a rising US dollar and 18 per cent against the trade-weighted basket. We are hearing about the effects of this in our liaison and also seeing it in the data on such things as tourism flows as well as exports of business services. This is to be expected as the exchange rate adjusts to the change in the terms of trade. Over the year to June, real GDP grew by 2 per cent. This was in line with our forecast of three months ago and at the lower end of our forecast range from a year ago. The effect of unusual weather conditions on exports meant that GDP as measured exaggerates both the strength in the March quarter and the weakness in the June quarter. There are still some puzzles in reconciling what has happened to real GDP with what has happened to employment and indications from business surveys. Hopefully, those puzzles will be resolved over time. Nonetheless, what is pretty clear is that the economy is growing, albeit not as fast as we would like, the adjustment to the decline in the terms of trade is well advanced, and non-mining activity is improving rather than deteriorating. If the latter trend continues, it is credible to think that we can achieve better output growth, particularly as we reach the later phases of the decline in mining investment. This is what is needed to bring down the unemployment rate. As always, global factors will be important and the international setting continues to be a rather complex one. Since the last hearing, growth in the Chinese economy has continued to moderate. Growth in other parts of Asia was also weaker around the middle of the year. Reflecting these outcomes, forecasts for global growth over the period ahead are a little lower than they were six months ago. That was the backdrop for a period of volatility in some financial markets. The unwinding of an equity market bubble in China appears to have served as the proximate trigger for a revision of equity valuations around the world. Risk appetite diminished somewhat and the currencies of many emerging market economies came under downward pressure. Whether that financial volatility itself will serve further to dampen global growth prospects remains to be seen. Sometimes such events portend a wider set of economic events, but just as often, they don’t. In the present instance, it is important to stress that long-term debt markets and core funding markets for financial institutions have not been impaired. These markets remain open and it is still the case that highly rated private borrowers and most sovereigns can borrow at remarkably low cost. Things could change, but at present we do not see anything approaching the dislocation of funding channels seen in serious crises. To be sure, emerging market countries are under some pressure and some of them have specific problems that are being recognised by markets. At the same time, though, many emerging market countries have done quite a bit to improve their resilience over the years. It’s also worth noting that performance in the Unites States continues to improve. Everyone knows that, eventually, this will have to be reflected in less accommodative US monetary policy. Some fretting about the first increase in US interest rates for nine years is to be expected, no matter how well telegraphed it has been. The more important factor, though, will be the pace of subsequent increases. The Federal Reserve has indicated this is expected to be very gradual, but of course that will depend on what happens with the US economy. There is a degree of irreducible uncertainty here and hence the possibility of further financial market volatility at some point. Overall though, it seems very likely that global interest rates will still be quite low for quite some time yet. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  For Australia, we cannot, of course, determine our terms of trade or other forces in the global economy. We can only adjust to them. The record of adjustment in recent years is good. We negotiated the financial crisis without a major financial crisis of our own or a big downturn in economic activity. We negotiated the first two phases of the resources boom without major inflationary problems, and are part way through our adjustment to the third phase – so far without a major slump in overall economic activity. There is still a pretty good chance that we will come out of this episode fairly well, and much better than we came out of previous episodes of this type. I now turn briefly to another area of the Bank’s responsibilities, namely the payments system. The New Payments Platform (NPP) will enable real-time, data-rich payments on a 24/7 basis for households, businesses and government agencies. The Payments System Board, having worked to facilitate the process of the private sector coming together to drive this project, supports the industry’s efforts. The Reserve Bank itself is making good progress in its own part in this project. In the card payments area, the Bank has announced a review and we released an Issues Paper in early March. Among other things, the review contemplates the potential for changes to the regulation of card surcharges and interchange fees. It provides an opportunity to consider some of the issues raised in the Financial System Inquiry. As usual, the Bank has been consulting widely, including via a roundtable in June that included representatives from over 30 interested organisations. The Payments System Board has asked the staff to liaise with industry participants on the possible “designation” of certain card systems. A decision to designate a system is the first of a number of steps the Bank must take to exercise any of its regulatory powers in respect of a payment system, but does not commit it to a regulatory course of action. The Payments System Board will have further discussions on the case for changes to the regulatory framework at future meetings. In the event that the Board were to propose changes to the regulatory framework, the Bank would, as usual, undertake a thorough consultation process on any draft standards. In our financial stability role, a focus has been on central counterparties, which facilitate efficient and safe clearing of some types of financial transactions. These entities are increasingly important given the way global regulatory standards have been moving. The Bank has focused on ensuring their risk management meets the highest standards and that they have the capacity to recover from financial shocks. We have also done a lot of work to ensure that our regulatory framework is appropriately recognised by regulators in other jurisdictions, which is important if we are to keep the Australian financial system connected with the global system. With those remarks, Chair, my colleagues and I await your questions. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Animal spirits in a period of volatility Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the Bloomberg FX Forum, Makati City, 2 September 2015. *      *      * Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Fortuitous or Good Planning? Someone in Bloomberg must be psychic, to have chosen “Hedging World Volatility” as theme for its 2015 FX Forum and at the same time to have scheduled the Forum in Manila during this precise week. Was that sixth sense or “bread and butter” excellent market reading? How do you hedge in a volatile market? Indeed, market volatility of late has not been contained to just a few countries or jurisdictions. It has neither been restricted to just either advanced or emerging markets, but it has spanned all categories of countries. And volatility has not been concentrated in one market or asset class alone, but it has crossed over from the commodity to the financial, and to some extent, the real goods market as well. With the variable forms of feedback loops and the uneven transmission mechanisms in the macrofinancial system, the relationships and correlations – as predicted by traditional models – appear to no longer be valid. Therefore, the question of how to “hedge” world volatility – as intimated by the theme of this Forum – is quite well timed. For those of you who have been in the market for a while now. A quick look around the room tells me, there aren’t too many of you around today. Perhaps, a sign of the changing times? Those of you who have already seen a number of episodes of volatility in “your day”, may be saying, this is a “healthy” correction. To a degree, I’ll have to agree with that. This “correction” is one good positive that is falling out of the recent market price action. We needed a tap on the brakes, so to speak, because the markets had been following one strong underlying trend for a while now, seemingly oblivious to other factors. Each time we come to a crossroads such as this, analysts would say we are in “uncharted” territory. I also cannot disagree with that. For certain, no one can be absolutely sure about a few things: 1.  The convergence between the recent pronouncements of various Fed officials and what the Fed will ultimately end up doing. Over the Jackson Hole weekend, Bill Dudley of the New York Fed said in an unscheduled interview that a September hike is “less compelling” now. For her part, Esther George of the Kansas City Fed who has repeatedly called for a hike, said “it’s too soon to say that recent market developments have altered the fundamental view” that the economy is prepared for normalization. Then Stan Fischer, Fed Vice Chair, spoke at a panel saying “there is good reason to believe inflation will move higher”, thus keeping the door open for a September hike. Can anyone really tell with certainty when and by how much the Fed will tighten? Some are of the view that while a September lift off may not seem prudent, given market volatility, it may just be what the market needs in order to eliminate one element of uncertainty, after all, monetary policy has significant lags. 2.  The next steps of Chinese authorities – whether they will continue to intervene, to what extent, in what form, and how such intervention will be funded. Some analysts put the cumulative decline in Chinese reserves since July to be over $300B. Question is, will they sell more US Treasuries to fund intervention? And if so, how will that impact on the US yield curve, and the Fed’s projected path of normalization? 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3.  What the ECB still has up its sleeves – how dependent these next moves would be on the behavior of its members, such as Greece. 4.  How the combination of these factors will be accounted for in the reaction functions of the other central banks and how these will ultimately all work themselves out in the currency, bond and commodity markets, and 5.  What would happen to global growth if China slows down significantly, and if the touted US growth ends up to be a “false” start. What or where then would be the engine for global growth? What concerns BSP the most? I have been asked, what is it that the BSP is most concerned about. Of all the risks I’ve listed just now, which would influence monetary policy the most? Ladies and gentlemen, it is very hard to say, with any degree of certainty, which factor would affect domestic monetary policy more, because, all these factors are interrelated. Therefore, for the rest of the time that has been given to me, let me – instead of singling out one risk – consider each item on the list and try to address what I believe are burning questions in your mind. Let’s start with the Fed moves. You may ask, will the BSP follow the Fed’s cue in terms of the timing and magnitude of the lift-off? My answer – not necessarily. We won’t have to sing the same tune, but we will certainly have to sing in harmony. What do I mean? Recall Q2 last year when we embarked on a series of monetary tightening actions. The Fed had not yet moved, but markets were certainly talking about it at the time. A number of factors were at play during that period last year. 1) Domestic inflation was threatening to breach the inflation target on the upside, and 2) M3 had been growing over 30 percent as a result of the operational adjustments in our SDA facility that we put in place to account for capital inflows. Fortunately, the economy was growing robustly then, and therefore there was no need to provide any monetary stimulus. In other words, it was our assessment that the economy could withstand some tightening in financial conditions at that time. You will recall that in our communication then, we further indicated that the moves were also motivated by the anticipation of Fed normalization. It was pre-emptive monetary tightening in order to help guide the domestic markets and break any tendency to under value/appreciate risks. Our concern was that an acute/unabated undervaluation of risks would create financial stability pressures, particularly in the real asset markets. While the risk of overhearing in the asset markets has since dissipated, we are not about to reverse that course of action yet. We will, however, consider 1) the actual and expected capital outflows that may result from the current global financial market rout and their impact on M3 growth, and, 2) carefully review the balance sheets/portfolios of the banking system to see if there is a need to adjust policy settings or tweak macroprudential measures. We will also, and more importantly, monitor inflation expectations. We have shared with you that for 2015, inflation is likely going to be lower than the government’s target band. Even so, inflation is seen to move higher and into target range in 2016 and 2017. Mindful therefore of the significant lags of monetary policy, we will be careful in making adjustments to policy settings going forward. Now let’s talk about China. You may ask, shouldn’t we also devalue the peso, after all a currency war seems to be in play? 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Textbooks describe competitive devaluation as a “beggar thy neighbor policy”. But that said, we know that policy makers will always do what they believe would be best for their own specific needs, sometimes without much concern for the impact of their actions on other jurisdictions. This brings to mind a higher policy consideration – the principle of “enlightened self-interest” as espoused by the Bank for International Settlements. BIS General Manager Jaime Caruana said that while it may seem that “keeping one’s house in order” is good defense, having a policy mindset of also taking into account spillovers of one’s actions may lead to improved overall welfare. After all, we share the same space, so to speak, and the same spillovers may “spill back” to one’s economy. My own appreciation of this principle is that seeking only one’s own goals may lead us to sub-optimal results. Given the size of our domestic market, we don’t think there is compelling reason to deviate from our current FX policy of allowing the markets to broadly determine the exchange rate. Just as we did during the period of strong capital inflows in earlier years, we will allow the exchange rate to adjust to market conditions also during this period when the potential for capital outflows may increase. The BSP will not go against the fundamental trend in the FX market, but we reserve scope for official action to smoothen volatilities that could disrupt business planning and dislodge inflation expectations. This policy is both efficient and equitable because the exchange rate affects different sectors of the economy, differently. Depreciation benefits exporters and other dollar earners, while it weighs on the debt burden of borrowers in foreign currency and increases the input cost of importers. I hear some murmurs, even see some quizzical looks. Well, let me borrow a phrase from Stan Fischer when he spoke at Jackson Hole over the weekend. I don’t wish to “disappoint your rational expectations” that I won’t tell you whether a breach of a certain exchange rate level would worry the BSP or not. Actually, the BSP has no “magical” exchange rate. As I have repeatedly said, the BSP doesn’t target specific exchange rate levels. But, we would be concerned if the rate is going too fast in one direction or the other, in a manner that is not consistent with fundamentals. As you may be aware, the Philippines enjoys a current account surplus. In fact, our current account has been in surplus for over a decade now supported by remittances, which continue to be “volatility-proof” and receipts from BPO services. This is important to bear in mind – because, at the end of the day, investors will discriminate. And, it has generally been the case that economies with strong external liquidity positions have been better able to minimize the impact of external shocks on their domestic economy and financial markets. Moving on to oil price developments. The most often asked question in relation to oil is – Is the BSP concerned with deflation, especially given the latest inflation outturns have been below 1 pct. and the fact that our forecast for August inflation is 0.2 to 1 pct.? With global growth prospects weakening, global oil prices may remain soft. Fuel and fuel-related items account for about 9 pct. of the items in the CPI. It stands to reason therefore that domestic inflation can be expected to also be soft going forward. That said, we see upside factors to inflation. These include: 1) that domestic wages are rigid downward (especially the mandated minimum and related benefits); 2) El Nino is projected to be prolonged, and may likely intensify; and 3) that potential economic output is estimated at around 5.5 to 6.5 pct. Current actual (1H 2015) output is at a respectable 5.3 pct. In other words, there are countervailing factors against low oil prices. Our assessment therefore is that the risks to deflation are contained. But we remain watchful of the supply/demand conditions in the international oil markets. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Closer to home, let’s talk about GDP. Q1 was revised downward to 5 pct. Q2 was announced to be 5.6 pct., driven by consumption. Government spending accelerated in Q2 and contributed positively to growth. With these, full-year growth is looking to be more modest than the government’s growth target of 7–8 pct. A question you may have in the back of your minds – Is there a need for the BSP to loosen policy settings to support growth, especially with the prospect of lower global growth? From indications, there may be no need at this time for economic stimulus from monetary policy. The government has fiscal space. As they did in Q2, government should step up spending on the vital infrastructure needed for economic growth to be sustainable. The forthcoming election spending, though a one-time shot in the arm, could also provide economic stimulus. What the BSP will do to help raise the growth trajectory – in addition to ensuring a low and stable inflation environment – is to further enhance banking sector policy to cement the strength of the banking system. The BSP will also continue to pursue market reform to help establish the financial market infrastructure for the efficient intermediation of funds between fund sources and users. NEDA projects that a more realistic economic growth rate for 2015 is 6–6.5 pct. It is comforting that even at these levels, the Philippines would likely still be among the fastest growing economies in the region. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve covered a lot of ground this afternoon. Let me summarize by saying: The BSP is watchful of domestic and external conditions. And, we are ready to take the appropriate policy actions, as and when needed, to minimize the potential adverse impact of risks to the economy. In the pursuit of creating growth opportunities for the economy, the BSP continues to look to the whole market’s continued support. I know market players live for volatility. It is what gets your juices going. But let me just provide some words of advice: These are not your typical “vols.” There is not necessarily any historical price action that you could confidently go back to, to calculate your VARs. Therefore, be very careful of any new products and markets that you are looking to deal in. Be sure you understand these well. Have the necessary credit, market and operational risk mitigants in place. Finally, this is not a bout of volatility that is likely to go away quickly. So, if you are in this game for the long haul, you need to temper animal spirits with a healthy dose of reflection and humility. I think I’ve said enough for now. Let me end here. I wish you all well. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mark Carney: Three truths for finance Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Harvard Club UK Southwark Cathedral dinner, London, 21 September 2015. *      *      * I am grateful to Ben Nelson and Iain de Weymarn for their assistance in preparing these remarks. “All England is an American shrine, full of rich records of the makers of their nation.”1 None more so than glorious St Saviour’s – Southwark Cathedral – a few minutes south of the river from here. Its connection with Harvard makes it something of an American Mecca. For at St Saviour’s was baptised a Southwark butcher’s son who became benefactor to the university that would bear his name. John Harvard would doubtless be delighted with what has become of the 320 volumes and £800 he bequeathed to posterity: a college founded for the avoidance of leaving “an illiterate ministry to the churches, when our present ministers shall lie in the dust”. From that bequest sprung one of the world’s leading universities. A community dedicated to its motto: Veritas – truth; the pursuit of truth in the sciences, humanities, even economics. Truth to create a better world. But recall Pilate’s question that has echoed down through the centuries from the pulpits of Southwark Cathedral to Memorial Church, “Truth? What is truth?” Indeed, upon arriving at Harvard, students and visitors are confronted with a curious truth, or rather, three untruths. In Harvard Yard sits a statue of John Harvard, seated on a bronze throne, commemorating 1638, the year of the university’s founding. Tour-guides relish in pointing out that, in fact: No-one knows what John Harvard looked like, so it is unlikely to be a great resemblance of him; The college wasn’t founded in 1638, but two years earlier; And it wasn’t founded by John Harvard, but by the Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which first voted to set up the university. The “Statue of the Three Lies” is part of Harvard legend. The Three Lies in question are harmless fun. But they should remind us how deeper untruths can persist, embodied in monuments or sustained by conventional wisdom and mores. We gather this evening almost seven years to the day that the failure of Lehman Brothers shattered conventional wisdom and laid bare three lies about finance. Unlike the statue’s three lies, those falsehoods have had lasting consequences.                                                 1  So wrote F A Mackenzie, a Quebec-born writer and journalist who was the Daily Mail’s travelling correspondent in the Far East in the early 1900s. See Mackenzie, F A, “American shrines in Britain”, Chapter XLV in Hammerton, J A (ed.) (1926), Wonderful Britain: its highways, byways and historic places, Vol. 2.  
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  *** Lie I: “This time is different” The first lie is the four most expensive words in the English language: “This Time Is Different.”2 This misconception is usually the product of an initial success, with early progress gradually building into blind faith in a new era of effortless prosperity. It took a revolution in macroeconomic policy to help win the battles against the high and unstable inflation, rising unemployment and volatile growth of the 1970s and ‘80s. In no small part due to my predecessors, particularly Lord King, the stagflationary threats in the UK were tamed by a new regime for monetary stability that was both democratically accountable and highly effective. Clear remits. Parliamentary accountability. Sound governance. Independent, transparent and effective policy-making. These were the great successes of the time and their value endures today. But these innovations didn’t deliver lasting macroeconomic stability. Far from it. Price stability was no guarantee of financial stability. An initially healthy focus became a dangerous distraction. Against the serene backdrop of the so-called Great Moderation, a storm was brewing. Debt was building rapidly, with total non-financial debt in the G7 doubling to 300 per cent of GDP between Prime Ministers Thatcher and Brown. In the US and UK, this was led by massive increases in household debt, the likes of which were last seen during the Great Depression. Several factors drove this debt super-cycle including demographics and the stagnation of middle-class real wages (itself the product of technology and globalisation). In the US, households had to borrow if they wanted to increase consumption. “Let them eat cake” had become “let them eat credit.” Financial innovation made it easier to do so. And the ready supply of foreign capital from the global savings glut made it cheaper. Most importantly – and this is the lie – complacency among individuals and institutions, fed by a long period of macroeconomic stability and rising asset prices, made this remorseless borrowing seem sensible. After the reckoning, the ensuing crisis and feeble recovery would look very much like all others that have followed prolonged credit booms. Policymakers quickly disassociated themselves from the received wisdoms of the Great Moderation and scrambled to re-learn the lessons of the Great Depression. That process continues today as central banks contemplate current parallels with the late 1930s. The aftermath of the global credit crunch has been severe. Global output is now ten percent below its pre-crisis trend, and with global nominal growth running two percentage points short of its pre-crisis average, the challenge of deleveraging remains acute. These challenges appear more pressing as some are now questioning their faith in another new era – China’s glide path to global economic hegemony. China’s economic miracle over                                                 2  For an extensive survey, see Reinhart, C and Rogoff, R, (2009), This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly, Princeton University Press. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  the past three decades is extraordinary, and it has helped to lift billions of people around the world out of poverty. However, the Chinese economy’s post-crisis performance has been bolstered by a large build-up of debt, which has more than doubled to reach almost 200% of GDP. As had been the case in the advanced world, the Chinese debt boom owed much to an explosion of shadow banking, which relates to the second lie of finance. Lie II: “Markets always clear” Beneath the new era thinking of the Great Moderation lay a deep-seated faith in the wisdom of markets. Policymakers were captured by the myth that finance can regulate and correct itself spontaneously. They retreated too much from the regulatory and supervisory roles necessary to ensure stability.3 That “markets always clear” is the second lie, one which gave rise to the complex financial web that inflated the debt bubble. In markets for goods, capital, and labour, evidence of disequilibria abounds. In goods markets, there is ‘sluggishness everywhere’. Left to themselves, economies can go for sustained periods operating above or below potential, resulting, ultimately, in excessive or deficient inflation. Yet efficient market forces ‘should’ bring about changes in prices sufficient to equate demand with potential, leaving inflation as a purely monetary phenomenon. In labour markets, there is ‘rigidity everywhere’. Rather than fluidly adjusting to equate the demand for labour with its supply, periods of deficient labour demand can persist, sustaining mass unemployment and joblessness. Yet efficient market forces “should” eliminate these disequilibria by having wages adjust to ensure full employment always and forever. Monetary Policy is not only a response to these rigidities; it is made effective by them. In capital markets, there is ‘momentum everywhere’. From bonds to equities to currencies and commodities, past winners seem to enjoy further winning streaks, while past losers persist in trailing behind.4 Yet efficient market forces ‘should’ eliminate these predictable movements before they become apparent. *** The belief that markets always clear had two dangerous consequences.5 First, if markets always clear, they can be assumed to be in equilibrium; or said differently “to be always right.” If the received wisdom is that the market is efficient, then bubbles can neither be identified nor their potential causes addressed. Such thinking dominated the (non)reaction to US subprime and housing booms. Consider that many market participants find it more profitable to anticipate each other’s behaviour than to divine the fundamentals.                                                 3  For a review of this broader phenomenon, see Padoa-Schioppa, T (2010), “Markets and government before, during and after the 2007-20xx crisis”, The Per Jacobsson Lecture, June. 4  Asness, C, Moscowitz, T and Pedersen, L (2013), “Value and momentum everywhere”, Journal of Finance, LXVIII, No. 3, June. 5  See also Turner, A (2010), “Market efficiency and rationality: why financial markets are different”, Lionel Robbins Memorial Lectures, London School of Economics. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The game of guessing what everyone else is guessing (everyone else is guessing…) was familiar to Keynes who observed that too often investors “devote [their] intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be”.6 This disconnect between decisions and fundamentals feeds market volatility and capital misallocation. Such “beauty contest” dynamics afflict not only sophisticated investors, but also many mortgage lenders and homebuyers, particularly during a “new era”. If house prices can only go up, it’s possible to borrow large multiples and pay off future obligations with the capital gains that will almost surely follow. Such “rational” behaviour fuelled the credit binge that ultimately led to the global crisis. Second, if markets always clear, they should possess a natural stability. Evidence to the contrary must be the product of market distortions or a result of incomplete markets. Much of financial innovation springs from the logic that the solution to market failures is to build new markets on old markets.7 Progress through infinite regress. During the Great Moderation, such thinking became an organising principle for financiers and policymakers. The latter pursued a light touch regulatory agenda in quest for the perfect world of complete markets first described by the economists Arrow and Debreu.8 Their world imagines self-interested, atomistic agents, coolly calculating odds over all future possible states of the world, writing and trading contracts with each other, all frictionlessly enforced, all achieving mutually beneficial – indeed socially optimal – outcomes. Of course, markets only clear in textbooks. In fact people are irrational, economies are imperfect, and nature itself is unknowable. When imperfections exist (which is always), adding markets can sometimes make things worse. Take credit derivatives, which were supposed to complete a market in default risk and thereby improve the pricing and allocation of capital. Financial alchemy seemed to have distributed risk, parcelling it up and allocating it to those who wanted most to bear it. However, the system had only spread risk, contingently and opaquely, in a way that actually ended up increasing it. Risk ended up concentrated on the balance sheets of intermediaries that were themselves capital constrained. With the fates of borrowers and lenders tied together via hyper-globalised banks and markets, problems at the core spread violently to the periphery. A truth of finance is that the riskiness of an asset depends on who owns it. When markets don’t always clear, the ultimate owner may be surprised to find what they do own. When that surprise is – or is thought to be – widespread, panic ensues. The impossibility of completing markets was not the only practical problem with the pre-crisis approach. Even if markets were perfect, nature itself is unknowable. Recall that the Arrow-Debreu world relies on people being able to calculate the odds of each and every possible scenario.                                                 6  Keynes, J M (1936), Chapter 12. 7  But economists of a more nuanced persuasion pointed out as far back as the 1950s that this logic is flawed. See Lipsey, R and Lancaster, K (1956), “The general theory of the second best”, Review of Economic Studies, 24(1).  8  Arrow, K and Debreu, (1954), “Existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy”, Econometrica, 22 (3). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Then they can trade contracts and insure each other against risks they are unwilling to bear. A moment of introspection reveals the absurdity of these assumptions as a description of the actual world. More often than not, even describing the universe of possible outcomes is beyond the means of the mere mortal, let alone ascribing subjective probabilities to those outcomes. That is genuine uncertainty, as opposed to risk, a distinction made by Frank Knight in the 1920s.9 And it means that market outcomes reflect individual choices made under a pretence of knowledge. The swings in sentiment that result – pessimism one moment, exuberance the next – don’t reflect nature’s odds, but our own assessments of them, inevitably distorted by Keynesian “animal spirits”.10 In the end, belief in the second lie that “markets always clear” meant that policymakers didn’t play their proper roles in moderating those tendencies in pursuit of the collective good. Lie III: “Markets are moral” Despite these shortcomings, well-managed markets can be powerful drivers of prosperity. By financing firms to hire, invest and expand, they drive growth. By opening up cross-border trade and investment they create new opportunities for businesses and savers. By transferring risks to those most willing to bear them, they help households and businesses insure against the unexpected. But if left unattended, markets can be prone to excess and abuse. That is particularly so in financial markets, where means and ends too easily become conflated. Value becomes abstract and relative. And the pull of the crowd can overwhelm the integrity of the individual. Lie three is that “markets are moral” – that financial capital can take for granted the social capital necessary for markets to fulfil their promise. Consider the example of fixed income, currencies and commodities markets, which historically have relied heavily on informal codes and understandings. That informality was well suited to an earlier age. But as markets innovated and grew, it proved wanting. Markets need to retain the consent of society – a social licence – to be allowed to operate, innovate and grow. Repeated episodes of misconduct (such as the Libor and FX scandals) have called that social licence into question. To restore it, we need to rebuild fair and effective markets.                                                 9  Knight, F (1921), Risk, uncertainty and profit, Signalman Publishing. 10  In Keynes (1936), Chapter 12, he wrote: “Even apart from the instability due to speculation, there is the instability due to the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on a mathematical expectation, whether moral or hedonistic or economic. Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits – of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.” Keynes, J M (1936), The General Theory of Interest, Employment and Money, Palgrave Macmillan. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Not markets that collapse when there is a shock from abroad. Not markets where transactions occur in chat rooms. Not markets where no one appears accountable for anything. Real markets are professional and open, not informal and clubby. Their participants compete on merit rather than collude online. Real markets are resilient, fair and effective. They maintain their social licence. But real markets don’t just happen; they depend on the quality of market infrastructure. Robust market infrastructure is a public good in constant danger of under-provision because the best markets innovate continually. This inherent risk can only be managed if all market actors, public and private, recognise their responsibilities for the system as a whole. True lies So this time is the same. Markets don’t always clear. And we can suffer from their amorality. So what to do with such knowledge? And how to retain it? The longer you are a central banker, the more careful you become in your forecasts. “Irreducible uncertainty” and “multiple equilibria” are occupational hazards; so if you must predict the future, you are tempted to hedge heavily and must modify constantly. But in two areas I’m confident: the Three Lies of John Harvard will continue to be revealed for years to come, and with time, the Three Lies of Finance will come to enjoy widespread credulity again. To resist their siren calls, policymakers and market participants must bind ourselves to the mast. That means building institutional structures that make it harder to act on the lies. Over the past seven years great strides have been made. Take “this time is different”. To guard against future complacency, policy frameworks have been substantially overhauled. The Bank of England has been given formal responsibility to maintain financial stability and has considerable powers to promote it. In anticipation of problems, we have increased bank capital and tightened mortgage standards. We are using our monetary policy and macroprudential policy tools in concert, so that a low for long interest rate environment can promote both price and financial stability. Moreover, when next time proves no different, the financial intermediaries at the core of the system will be on a substantially stronger footing. Their capital requirements have already increased ten-fold and their liquid assets are up four-fold. Their trading assets are down by a third and intra-bank exposures by two-thirds. Though we cannot hope to eliminate systemic risk altogether, reform is ending Too Big To Fail for individual institutions. The combination of eliminating the implicit public subsidy and increasing capitalisation will reduce distorted pricing by banks and shift activity to market based finance. Choice and competition – real market forces – are increasing. Recognising that “markets do not always clear” has spurred several initiatives. Reform is improving risk transfer by untangling the complex web of derivatives and creating simple, comparable and transparent securitisations. The Bank is helping to change the plumbing of markets so that they are more resilient to the failure of individual counterparties, and we are working to understand better the dynamics of market liquidity given changes to regulation, trading strategies and the rise of asset management. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  The Bank has also overhauled the way we provide liquidity by expanding the range of collateral as well as the number and types of counterparties. And recognising that the instability of markets may mean they occasionally seize up, the Bank now stands ready to act as a Market Maker of Last Resort. And the third lie? In order to help restore trust and fairness, financial reform is re-building real markets. Earlier this year, we published the Fair and Effective Markets Review. It identified multiple root causes of misconduct in FICC markets that contributed to an ethical drift and an abdication of responsibility. A good start has been made in addressing these shortcomings including through changes to compensation regimes, clarifying the responsibilities of senior management and overhauling the structure of some markets to reduce opportunities for abuse. But more is needed. Individuals need to be held more to account for their actions. Doing so will require new common standards, cast in clear language, better training and higher qualifications, and ways to ensure that when employees are fired, their history is known to those who consider hiring them. Firms must take responsibility for the system by improving the understanding of acceptable trading practices. The industry has already taken the lead by establishing a new FICC Markets Standards Board that will establish common standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and keep pace with markets. Regulators need to take a tough line on market abuse, including extending criminal sanctions to every corner of currency and fixed income markets. And to consign the Age of Irresponsibility well and truly to history, London, as the largest global market, must lead the development of global standards. With the main building blocks of reform in place, now is the time to take stock. It’s vital that we – public authorities and private market participants – work together to reverse the tide of ethical drift. This cannot be a one-off exercise; we need continuous engagement so that market infrastructure keeps pace with market innovation. This November, the Bank of England will hold an Open Forum at the Guildhall. The programme, published tomorrow, has been developed not just by policymakers and market participants, but also representatives of well-known companies, trade unions, academia, the media and civil society. An online portal for registration will open tomorrow morning, with attendance determined shortly thereafter by a ballot.11 Debate on social media is already underway,12 and there will be live webcasts available on the day. The Open Forum is open to everyone, because the UK’s markets matter for everyone. Our goal is to discuss the prospects for market functioning, where regulations might overlap or conflict, and whether enough has been done to build the real markets the UK deserves. Markets that merit social licence and reinforce social capital. In the best traditions of Harvard, we should use the compass of Veritas, so that, when we too are dust, others can build on our legacy, as so many have on that of Southwark’s John Harvard.                                                 11  See www.boeopenforum.co.uk. 12  See #BoEOpenForum. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Cœuré: Interview in EBRA newspaper group Interview with Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in EBRA newspaper group, (L’Alsace, Les Dernières Nouvelles d’Alsace, Le Républicain Lorrain, L’Est Républicain, Vosges Matin, Le Bien Public, Le Journal de Saône-et-Loire, Le Progrès, Le Dauphiné Libéré and Vaucluse Matin), conducted by Mr Francis Brochet and published on 11 September 2015. *      *      * Can we have confidence in the growth in the euro area? Yes. Growth has returned and the unemployment rate is falling in the euro area. We can trust in the euro to protect us in an international environment where major emerging economies are experiencing a slowdown and financial markets are very volatile. The European Central Bank is protecting growth by clearly stating that its policy of very low interest rates and its asset purchases will continue for as long as necessary. But growth is still not strong enough to create a sufficient number of jobs. Many people see the euro area as more of a straitjacket than a form of protection… Sharing a currency is like living under the same roof – there must be common rules. These rules, for example regarding deficit and debt reduction, do act as constraints, but they also establish collective trust, making it possible to have very low interest rates and stable prices. If a country were to free itself from these rules, it would be completely unprotected and find itself alone in the face of the volatility of global markets. But Joseph Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, recently said in this publication that the rules are too strict and that austerity kills growth… In economics, as in politics, it’s all a matter of degree. Today, the euro area as a whole has a balanced approach to fiscal policy, and fiscal adjustment, which was necessary, is no longer hampering growth. As for France, there is still some way to go. Greece is still in the process of adjusting. Are you concerned about the result of the elections on 20 September? There is a fairly broad consensus among the governing parties and, I believe, the Greek people that it is in the country’s interests to remain in the euro area, and that this requires adjustment efforts. That is the rationale of the programme adopted in August. Wasn’t the agreement forced on the Greek people? Did they have a choice? It is a political agreement between the 19 Heads of State or Government of the euro area that strikes a balance between two legitimate concerns – the mandate of Mr Tsipras, who was elected on a certain programme, and the fact that this programme is partially financed by the other euro area countries and their taxpayers, who also have the right to express their point of view. The important thing is that Greece and its partners trust each other again. On this basis, there will be room for manoeuvre when it comes to adapting the programme after the elections, for example in terms of labour market reforms and tackling vested interests, provided that the objectives of the programme are met. You talk about unemployment, but the ECB is supposedly only worried about inflation… When inflation is weak, the best way to bring it up to the 2% objective is to support economic activity. Today, therefore, growth and employment are prerequisites for price stability. There is no contradiction. Are the days of foolish finance over? 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Not entirely. The ECB is strongly committed to financial stability. European citizens should not be subjected to the ups and downs of the financial markets. This also requires financial actors to behave in a reasonable manner and respect the rules. A lot of work has been done since the crisis to make these rules stricter and banks stronger. However, I think it is still necessary to increase the personal responsibility of financial actors. Banks’ senior managers must be accountable for the operations carried out by their teams. This is the only way to avoid certain abuses, such as the manipulation of indices for speculative purposes. You want a more integrated euro area. This implies more sovereignty being transferred from member countries to Europe. Are people ready for this? More integration will make Europe more effective. In a globalised world, France cannot stand alone; it is too small, regardless of its great history and many talents. But we cannot force people into this. Europe will first have to demonstrate its usefulness by creating more growth and more jobs. But when you see the “every man for himself” approach to the migrant crisis, do you not despair of Europe? It is true that each country’s initial reaction followed national instincts. However, coordinated efforts are now gradually being made, and they will continue to evolve. I think that this crisis, which deeply moves us all, will actually be a wake-up call that makes us realise how essential Europe really is. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Scaling up for a more inclusive and more responsive financial system Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the Bank Marketing Awards of the Bank Marketing Association of the Philippines, Makati City, 28 August 2015. *      *      * The officers and members of the Bank Marketing Association of the Philippines under the leadership of President Mike Villareal, colleagues in the banking industry, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good evening. In its website, BMAP describes itself as “an organization of banking institutions which seeks to upgrade the practice of bank marketing in the country.” On its 41st year, BMAP remains true to its mandate. Tonight, with the Bank Marketing Awards, BMAP rewards the best bank marketing programs and inspires its members to aspire for award-winning excellence. I am therefore pleased to be with you tonight to congratulate BMAP and tonight’s awardees. You have raised the bar of excellence and henceforth will serve as benchmark in the years to come. After all, it is said that we do not forget our “firsts.” This means that the next batch of winners must be truly exceptional to be equally memorable. I hope therefore that BMAP succeeds in sustaining this drive to excel that stands to benefit your banks, your customers, and ultimately our economy. Your timing is perfect. Last month, we launched our National Strategy for Financial Inclusion or what we call NSFI as well as the results of our National Baseline Survey for Financial Inclusion. I am positive that both will help you craft marketing programs with optimum results. The NSFI integrates the financial inclusion programs of 13 government institutions including the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. It also provides a platform for government-private partnerships for financial inclusion as a means to achieve inclusive growth. To see how is relevant to you and your bank, you may visit our website at www.bsp.gov.ph. For now, let me share some of the highlights of our National Baseline Survey on Financial Inclusion which was completed early this year: 1. Ninety-seven percent (97%) of Filipino adults believe that it is important to save money and to have the way or means to save money. And yet, our survey indicated that only 4 out of 10 Filipinos actually save money. 2. Of those who save, 70% keep their money at home; while only 30% of savers keep their money in banks. 3. Six out of ten adults with bank accounts indicated that the bank’s reputation is their main consideration in opening a deposit account. Other considerations are interest rates, minimum maintaining balance, proximity of the bank branch, and quality of client service. 4. Forty-seven percent of Filipinos borrow money. While more than 85% of respondents indicate that they want to access financial services from formal financial institutions, majority of them still borrow from family, friends and informal lenders. Banks as source of borrowing stood only at 4.4. 5. The primary considerations in borrowing money are: interest rates, loan amount, period to pay for the loans, ease of loan application, reputation of the credit institution, amortization, collateral, fees, and processing time. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Ladies and gentlemen. These survey results provide useful insights on how to serve your customers better and how to expand your market. Indeed, there is so much untapped potential that bank marketing experts such as yourselves can reach, develop, and grow with. As we move toward ASEAN integration, growing and protecting your market will become more challenging. It is best to work on this now. In selecting tonight’s awardees, I understand BMAP selected as criteria four key factors in making a marketing program successful: these are strategy, creativity, execution and results. Applying these factors to your products and programs should help you develop solid and excellent marketing programs. In general, a product can be upgraded when it is no longer in its prime. In our industry, however, the ultimate product is public trust. It is a product that is fragile, demands constant care and requires special packaging. And while public trust may seem to be generic, we must also recognize the socio-economic diversity of our archipelago. The point is, that it will take marketing savvy and creativity to make all these details come to life in a holistic and integrated manner. Ladies and gentlemen. The challenge is not one of sales; it is about marketing. By that, I mean the ability to package specific products to those who need the specific features of the product. This is important in banking where we adhere to a fiduciary responsibility and must constantly meet the bar of client suitability. As banking and finance is typically too esoteric to the general public, this is where creativity is a must. You need to bridge the demands of a differentiated public to the array of products and services that are available and possible. You need to distill the complexities of banking to messages that the broad public can relate to and base their decisions on. This should help you build a lasting relationship with your clients. This lasting relationship is the ultimate measure of public trust; it validates the value proposition that your bank presents to the general public. And if the growth of the banking industry and the increased state of financial inclusion are to be used as measures, then we certainly must recognize the efforts of the best in bank marketing programs. This initiative underscores the convergence in the goals of BMAP and the BSP which is to enable more Filipinos to benefit from banking services. I am therefore pleased that your awards cover best financial inclusion program, best kiddie savings program, best program in social media, best product program, best brand program and best electronic delivery channel. Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to reap the benefits of a strong banking industry. Not only are we expanding, the banking industry has remained a pillar of strength in our economy in the face of new volatilities in the global financial landscape. That said, we do have to recognize that we need to address the gaps in our financial inclusion goals. This is where BMAP can play a significant role. Our ultimate stakeholder, our ultimate market in our efforts is the Filipino financial consumer. We want Filipino financial consumers to develop good money habits that will them achieve financial independence. Indeed, the triumvirate of financial access, financial education and consumer protection makes perfect sense because there is a clear message that is defined for a particular audience. Again, here is another case of marketing: targeting specific products and calibrated interventions for specific audiences under specific conditions. Given this, I am already looking forward to next year’s set of Bank Marketing Award winners. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  At this point, I want to thank BMAP for continuing to expand its partnership with the BSP – the latest being with our FCPD on the Project BRO campaign (BSP Reaches Out) to emphasize the value of developing saving as a habit at a young age. The “alkansya” gives us that cultural backdrop for this effort and I thank BMAP for providing the alkansya and shouldering the freight cost to Davao, Digos, Dipolog and Iloilo for this campaign. I also look forward to BMAP finally reaching our goal of opening one million (1,000,000) kiddie accounts within the next few months. Supported and empowered by our major banks, the BSP-BMAP Kiddie Account Program has generated for us international recognition and award as a best practice model that other countries admire but till now could not implement. I am also pleased to share that our reward program for the best financial teachers in public schools is now on its third year under the DepEd-BSP Guro ng Pag-Asa (Gantimpala Para sa Ulirang Pag-tuturo ng Pag-iimpok at Araling Pansalapi). The objective of the program is to continue to raise the level of excellence in teaching saving, money management and entrepreneurship to millions of our schoolchildren starting from Grade I. Secretary Luistro has issued a memorandum circular to public school teachers across the country about our third Guro ng Pag-Asa. With financial lessons taught well in schools, we can look forward to raising a new generation of Filipinos who have developed the habit of saving and managing their personal finances successfully. Ladies and gentlemen, we all want a bright tomorrow, not only for ourselves but for our children and their children’s children. We know that this means we have to invest today to shape the future. The awards that you launch today is a step in the right direction. We should make time to recognize those who excel and continue to raise the bar of excellence within the banking industry. Once again, congratulations to all the awardees. Your peers have gathered here tonight to celebrate your success and commit to do better in the years ahead. Finally, let us congratulate BMAP and its leadership for serving as a catalyst for positive change and for its continuing collaboration with the BSP in the areas of financial inclusion, financial education, and consumer protection. Mabuhay ang BMAP! Mabuhay ang ating mahal na bansang Pilipinas! Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat! 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Claudia Buch: Evaluation and macroprudential policy Speech by Prof Claudia Buch, Deputy President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Annual meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik, Münster, 7 September 2015. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen The theme of this year’s annual meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik is “Economic development – theory and policy”. The evaluation of development aid projects has a relatively long tradition – from which many other policy areas may benefit. Much greater use could still be made of research findings on the evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of public projects and economic policy measures. I wish to illustrate this using macroprudential policy as an example. Why are development aid projects frequently evaluated? For one thing, financiers expect accountability on the impact of their financial assistance. For another, researchers can often contribute to the project design. That lets them incorporate the features needed for an ex post impact analysis while the project is still on the drawing board. Ex ante planning allows evaluation data to be collected in a manner conducive to maximising the reliability of econometric identification. Tackling a stimulating research topic without nagging questions about the identification strategy boosts the likelihood of being published. That’s an incentive for researchers to get involved in evaluation and the key to putting evidence-based economic policymaking into practice. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I think we need to see more of in other policy fields. But the actual impact of measures is often just as uncertain outside the realm of development aid. In many cases, the projects in question are much larger still and relate to entire countries – tax policy, education policy, health policy – and not forgetting financial market regulation. The question for me is this: how can we make sure that these areas, too, are subject to greater and, above all, scientifically proven evaluation? There are two hurdles to overcome, in my view, but neither of them are insurmountable. The first is the inadequate data pool, the second a frequent absence of a need for the scientifically-based evaluation of policy measures. As Deputy President of the Bundesbank, one of my areas of responsibility is financial stability. This includes macroprudential policy. We still don’t know all that much about the impact of macroprudential policy measures right now. The available evidence is very sparse; it is often no more than cross-sectional analyses across different countries derived from short time series. We are therefore working to create the conditions for superior policy evaluation. 1. What is financial stability? Macroprudential policy is a relative newcomer to the policy space. In some respects, the level of knowledge and experience in this area is roughly on a par with that in the field of monetary policy some years ago. The specific policy goals are difficult to quantify, transmission channels are often unknown, and the data sets and analytical methods need to be developed. Why do we need macroprudential policy? The world of traditional banking regulation offers little scope for curbing the systemic repercussions of financial crises because it focuses primarily on the economic health of individual market participants. For the most part, microprudential analysis is based on the assumption that the financial system as a whole is stable, that markets are liquid and that market players that run into difficulties will not have a significant detrimental impact on the financial system or the economy as a whole. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  But that view is a short-sighted one, because past episodes in which seemingly isolated microprudential risks were either misinterpreted or underestimated have taught us that our work needs to take a broader perspective. Risks to the stability of the financial system can arise if large institutions create negative externalities (too big to fail), if institutions are highly interconnected (too connected to fail), or also if many smaller institutions are exposed to similar types of risk (too many to fail). This key takeaway from the recent financial crisis prompted the establishment of macroprudential authorities around the world that focus on risks that might threaten the financial system as a whole. Let’s begin with the mandate and the objective. The objective of macroprudential policy is to safeguard financial stability. Financial stability is the term used to denote the financial system’s ability to perform its key macroeconomic functions – particularly so in the event of unforeseen events, periods of stress or structural upheaval. For the costs of financial crisis can be heavy – not only with regard to the amount and duration of real economic losses but also concerning the often considerable fiscal costs. It is not about completely curbing risks and fluctuations in the financial markets but instead about reducing negative externalities caused by the distress of individual institutions or market segments. Here, we need to ask ourselves how “financial stability” can be measured and concrete indicators formulated. After all, even though the situation appears to be stable, the creation of systemic risk through moral hazard can jeopardise financial stability. That’s why reducing misguided incentives and increasing the size of risk buffers in the system are key to maximising financial system stability. From this general definition, indicators – such as property prices, risk premiums or credit growth – are derived in the policymaking process and used to assess financial stability. 2. Macroprudential policy in Germany Main responsibility for financial stability in Europe rests at the national level. In Germany, the Financial Stability Committee (FSC) was created in 2013 as a national macroprudential body. It comprises representatives of the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the Bundesbank and the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency (FMSA), which has observer status. The Bundesbank plays a special role in the FSC, by injecting its experience of macroeconomic analyses and of banking supervision. In a nutshell, the Bundesbank is the FSC’s “analytical arm”. What is more, besides preparing the Committee’s annual report to the German Bundestag on the status of financial stability in Germany, the Bundesbank also drafts warnings and recommendations by the FSC and assesses their implementation. Of course, merely establishing macroprudential institutions does nothing to boost financial stability – rather, what are needed are a strategy for macroprudential policy and the appropriate instruments. The internationally agreed Basel III regime that is currently in force already contains a number of instruments designed with macroprudential matters in mind. For instance, systemically important banks have to hold more capital than other institutions, primarily as a way of countering the moral hazard (“too big to fail”) caused by their size. Another instrument is the countercyclical capital buffer, or CCB, which is designed to boost financial system resilience by tightening capital requirements in times of increased lending. The CCB is scheduled to become legally effective in Germany on 1 January 2016, though no decision has been taken hitherto as to its exact level. However, these instruments are no more than a rudimentary toolkit for combatting systemic risk emanating from real estate markets. And yet the recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated just how important the residential property market is for financial stability. A 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  number of other countries are already using dedicated macroprudential instruments for the real estate market; Germany, by contrast, does not have the requisite legal basis as yet. To close this gap, the FSC submitted a recommendation to the Federal Government on 30 June 2015 proposing the creation of new macroprudential instruments for the residential real estate market. I would expressly point out, however, that this step does not mean that these instruments will be deployed or activated. The FSC is recommending four instruments: a cap on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, a cap on the debt-to-income ratio/debt-service-to-income ratio as well as an amortisation requirement. An LTV ratio, for instance, specifies a minimum amount of equity capital which a debtor must contribute to a residential real estate financing transaction. These instruments have two objectives. One is to reduce the likelihood of overindebtedness and thus of crises. The other is to stem the effects of crises, should they occur anyway, by means of larger risk buffers. If these instruments are activated in the future, an ex post impact analysis should be carried out. That calls for sound data, which is why the Committee’s recommendation asked for the creation of a legal basis for the collection of granular data and a mandatory ex post impact analysis. 3. How do data fit into the equation? But what are “sound data”? The lessons learned from the US experience tell us that a loosening of credit standards for subprime households can be one of the major root causes of financial crises. A development of that kind can only be identified if granular data are to hand. The Bundesbank has responded to the need for higher-quality and above all granular data by establishing its Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC).1 A new project has been launched to administer and link microdata and macrodata, and to make them available to both Bundesbank and external researchers. At present, ten members of staff are busy capturing, compiling and maintaining these data, which are being used in 120 projects. Internationally, too, a host of initiatives have been kick-started in an effort to close data gaps. For instance, Europe’s central banks will, in the coming years, be setting up AnaCredit, a comprehensive database which will help them to link loan-level data and banks’ balance sheet data. That kind of data pool would open up a wealth of analytical opportunities that we could use in a great many areas. The Bundesbank’s RSDC is specifically looking to establish close ties between research and policy guidance. The idea is for researchers to be given access, free of charge and with a minimum of red tape, to the data – subject, of course, to the appropriate data protection requirements. So by increasing the availability of sound data, we are going a long way towards dismantling the first of the two hurdles we face in this field. However, data alone are insufficient to tell us how effective an economic policy measure has been. This measure, rather, needs to be embedded in a structured impact study. Applying a set of objective and structured procedures specified upfront can yield information on effectiveness and potentially increase the likelihood that a policy measure will be accepted. They prevent situations in which inconvenient findings go unpublished or access to the necessary data is obstructed. The guidelines adopted by the Verein für Socialpolitik are an important and a necessary step. At their heart are the general principles of methodological quality, transparency, objectivity and independence. But to make sure data shortages do not scupper evaluations, the data capture process should be planned well ahead of introduction and be enshrined in law. This                                                 1  http://www.bundesbank.de/Navigation/EN/Bundesbank/Research/RDSC/rdsc.html. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  modus operandi not only cuts the cost of policy evaluation, but also diminishes the risk that the necessary data cannot be provided at all ex post. And last but not least, making evaluation mandatory would be a step in the right direction. This procedure is widely followed internationally, one example being the Office of Management and Budget in the United States, which is required by law to evaluate legislation with a substantial financial impact, while in Switzerland, policy evaluation is even enshrined in the national constitution. In this connection, let me revisit the FSC recommendation I referred to earlier. It contains a regular impact analysis which can also be verified by third parties. Ladies and gentlemen, impact analyses are an important tool for finding out more about the efficacy of policy measures, quantifying costs and benefits, and flagging unexpected side-effects. They require guidelines for decision-makers and researchers. However, they can also only work in a forward-looking policy environment which aims to enshrine policy evaluation in law and which provides the necessary financial and data resources. It is important for researchers to contribute their expertise and ideas, and play a part in this process. More often than not, bright ideas are the “by-products” of stimulating debate with peers. That’s the reason why we’re all here today, so without further ado, I will bring my speech to a close. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 N S Vishwanathan: Basel III implementation – challenges for Indian banking system Inaugural address delivered by Mr N S Vishwanathan, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, on the occasion of the National Conference on “BASEL III Implementation: Challenges for Indian banking system”, organised by The Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry of India with support of National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM), Mumbai, 31 August 2015. *      *      * Assistance provided by Mr. Ajay Kumar Choudhary and Mr Rajnish Kumar in preparing this speech is gratefully acknowledged. Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. 1. I am indeed privileged to be sharing the dais with stalwarts and thank ASSOCHAM for giving me this opportunity to speak on challenges in implementing Basel III in India. 2. Basel III framework was basically the response of the global banking regulators to deal with the factors, more specifically those relating to the banking system that led to the global economic crisis or the great recession. In the advanced economies, there was a huge fiscal cost for protecting the financial system, which those governments did not want a repeat of. The framework therefore sought to increase the capital and improve the quality thereof to enhance the loss absorption capacity and resilience of the banks, brought in a leverage ratio to contain balance sheet expansion in relation to capital, introduced measures to ensure sound liquidity risk management framework in the form of liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR), modified provisioning norms and of course enhanced disclosure requirements. 3. In India, Basel III capital regulation has been implemented from April 1, 2013 in phases and it will be fully implemented as on March 31, 2019. Further, we have also introduced Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to be implemented by banks in India from January 1, 2015 with full implementation being effective from January 1, 2019. We have issued draft guidelines on implementation of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). We are also working on other areas of evolving regulations, especially those which are of critical importance from Indian perspective. 4. As this event is on challenges in implementing Basel III let me begin with the assumption that there are challenges. Any change, big or small, of whatever nature brings with it challenges. The issue one must look at is whether the challenges are as onerous as one would think them to be and whether the challenges are worth facing up to. 5. The first element in this debate was whether we needed Basel III at all for a country like India. On this, Dr. Subba Rao, the then Governor of RBI1 made an interesting point and I quote him: “One view, although not explicitly spelt out in that form, is that India need not adopt Basel III, or should adopt only a diluted version of it, so as to balance the benefits against the putative costs. To buttress this view, it is argued that Basel III is designed as a corrective for advanced economy banks which had gone astray, oftentimes taking advantage of regulatory gaps and regulatory looseness, and that Indian banks which remained sound through the crisis should not be burdened with the “onerous” obligations of Basel III.                                                  1  Basel III in International and Indian Contexts Ten Questions We Should Know the Answers For– Inaugural Address by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Annual FICCI – IBA Banking Conference at Mumbai on September 04, 2012. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches The Reserve Bank does not agree with this view. Our position is that India should transit to Basel III because of several reasons. By far the most important reason is that as India integrates with the rest of the world, as increasingly Indian banks go abroad and foreign banks come on to our shores, we cannot afford to have a regulatory deviation from global standards. Any deviation will hurt us both by way of perception and also in actual practice. The “perception” of a lower standard regulatory regime will put Indian banks at a disadvantage in global competition, especially because the implementation of Basel III is subject to a “peer group” review whose findings will be in the public domain. Deviation from Basel III will also hurt us in actual practice. We have to recognize that Basel III provides for improved risk management systems in banks. It is important that Indian banks have the cushion afforded by these risk management systems to withstand shocks from external systems, especially as they deepen their links with the global financial system going forward.” 6. Once we take this postulate for granted, and in fact it needs to be, let us see what the challenges are: Capital What are the factors that lead to higher capital? 7. The first set of Basel III reforms agreed in later part of 2010 tackled the issue of numerator part of regulatory capital ratio. While minimum total capital requirements were kept unchanged at 8% of the RWA, the definition of various components of capital and its composition were thoroughly revised to ensure that capital performs its intended role of loss absorption. The minimum common equity requirement was raised from 2% level, before the application of regulatory adjustments, to 4.5% after the application of stricter adjustments. This meant that common equity requirement was effectively raised from 1% to 4.5%. The Tier 1 capital, which includes common equity and other qualifying financial instruments based on stricter criteria, was increased from 4% to 6%. It has also been agreed that there would be a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum requirement to be met with common equity. This effectively increases the total capital requirements from present 8% to 10.5%. In our case, the level of capital increases from 9% to 11.5%, if capital conservation buffer is taken into account. In this context, it may be pertinent to note that post-crisis, major banks in advanced economies have raised their capital adequacy level significantly. In general, globally banks have raised their CET1 ratio by almost 400 bps during last four years. And importantly, this is mainly by way of fresh infusion of equity capital. A comparative capital position of major Indian banks vis-à-vis major global banks as indicated in graph 1. As may be appreciated, capital levels of our banking system need to go up significantly if our major banks have to compete globally. During recent years, the capacity of banks specifically, for the PSBs to generate capital internally have adversely affected mainly due to sharp deterioration in the asset quality. At the same time, banks have not made concerted efforts to shore up their capital level outside of the usual budgetary support. After the phased-in implementation of Basel III, the RBI apprised the Government of India on the need to initiate appropriate measures to ensure that PSBs have plans and a well-defined strategy for meeting the capital requirements from a medium-term perspective. In this context, it is heartening to note that Government has initiated several measures such as allowing PSBs to access market to raise capital subject to ensuring minimum shareholding of the Government of 52% and recent unleashing of a plan for revamping PSBs called “Indra dhanush” These measures show the intent and commitment of Government to provide additional budgetary support to these banks to ensure that PSBs remain adequately capitalized to support 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 economic growth. The improvement in the equity capital and all other measures taken together may also facilitate raising non-equity capital (AT1 and Tier 2), as the markets / investors would be more receptive to those banks holding a higher level of common equity. 8. The second element in the capital framework is the leverage ratio. We have advised banks that they would be monitored on a leverage ratio of 4.5%. We are watching this closely. Leverage ratio generally does not adjust the assets for risk weights and therefore would need the required capital for a given balance sheet. We have seen on the basis of the RW profile of banks that the leverage ratio is not acting as the binding factor for most banks in India. The graph 2 shows the interaction between Tier 1 leverage ratios (horizontal axis) and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios (vertical axis) of domestic banks. The diagonal line represents the points where the Tier 1 capital requirements would remain the same for meeting both the ratios. Therefore, for banks above the diagonal line, the leverage ratio requires more capital than risk-based capital ratio and vice-versa. To ensure that the leverage ratio acts as a credible back-stop measure, the Reserve Bank would continue to monitor the leverage ratio behaviour of Indian banks and also the developments of other related regulatory framework before finalizing the appropriate level of leverage ratio for Indian banks. 9. Another element that could lead to higher capital is the changes in the Risk Weighted Assets, more specifically, on account of proposed revisions to the standardised approaches for risk measurements. The BCBS intends to avoid reliance on credit ratings for determining risk weights for credit risk given the lessons learnt from the crisis. Although this is work in progress, under the proposed revised framework, banks would be required to utilise a set of risk drivers like leverage of the entity, NPAs, etc. to determine the appropriate risk weight. Similarly, for market risk, there would be a requirement to compute sensitivities (delta, gamma, etc.) on a deal level for computing RWAs. For measuring counterparty credit risk (CCR) in the derivatives, both in the OTC and exchange-traded derivatives, the existing current exposure method (CEM) will be replaced with a revised method called standardised approach for CCR (SA-CCR). Besides, talks are already underway to review the existing treatment of sovereign assets under Basel framework wherein exposure to sovereign requires zero or very little capital charge. These proposals will alter the way banks compute RWAs. Besides, a new explicit capital charge for interest rate risk for banking book positions is also proposed to be introduced. Further, specific to the advanced approaches for risk measurement, the Basel Committee is undertaking a strategic framework review with a view to enhancing simplicity, reducing complexity and at the same time ensuring that the framework remains risk sensitive. The Committee would also examine the potential for interaction amongst various policy prescriptions amongst themselves as well as with the monetary policy objectives to assess whether there is any potential room for material inconsistency which may severely undermine the overall objectives. 10. The fourth element impacting capital requirements is provisioning. IFRS 9 requires provisioning based on expected loss provisions. The BCBS only recently put out a discussion paper on accounting issues in estimating expected loss. 11. No doubt the new framework will need additional capital. Specific to the PSBs, Government has announced the infusion of Rs 70000 crore over the next four years. But the need of the hour is as much for the PSBs to improve their internal processes to enhance efficiency, optimise the capital allocation and deal with the asset quality issue. There are several measures internal to banks and they must look at them than just look at the external factors. A lot can be done to improve credit underwriting, manage the credit post disbursement and recoveries. There is thus scope for improvement of internal accruals as a source of capital, and improving efficiency, risk management system and asset quality management are one of the most important parts of that effort so that external capital is not required for cleaning up balancer sheets unlike what would be happening now. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches 12. When capital requirement increases, there is impact on growth. There are varying estimates of this impact. The Macroeconomic Assessment Group (MAG) established in February 2010 by Financial Stability Board and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to coordinate an assessment of the macroeconomic implications of the Basel Committee’s proposed reforms, estimates that bringing the global common equity capital ratio to a level that would meet the agreed minimum requirement and the capital conservation buffer would result in a maximum decline in GDP, relative to baseline forecasts, of 0.22%, which would occur after 35 quarters. In terms of growth rates, annual growth would be 0.03 percentage points (or 3 basis points) below its baseline level during this time. This is then followed by a recovery in GDP towards the baseline. Banks can also respond to the higher capital requirements by reducing costs or becoming more efficient. In fact a less stable financial system could have more deleterious consequences. The extent to which the great recession put global economic growth back is proof enough of this. Liquidity 13. The second Challenge comes from Liquidity Framework. The global crisis underscored the importance of liquidity management by banks. The apparently strong banks ran into difficulties when the interbank wholesale funding market witnessed a seizure. In fact I have mentioned elsewhere too that for me it is only a matter of time before a liquidity risk degenerates into a solvency risk for a bank and therefore needs to be avoided. The crisis proved that and had it not been for central bank support, the crisis toll could have gone beyond what we saw. The LCR and the NSFR Frameworks basically address this problem. 14. In the Indian context, any discussion on the LCR issue brings to the fore the fact that it runs parallel to SLR requirement. We have over a period of time reduced SLR and of the current level of 21.5%, a portion i.e.7 % is available for LCR as well. There is always the contention that the parallel need to maintain SLR and LCR poses an additional burden on the banks in India. We are aware of this concern and already communicated our intention to reduce the SLR requirements in a phased manner. However, there are several factors that would have to be addressed before we can move further to address the potential overlap. 15. The NSFR framework is draft for consultation. We are looking at the comments received and will come out with the final guidelines taking into consideration the responses to the extent we can accommodate them. Technology 16. The Third challenge is technology. As I mentioned earlier, BCBS is in the process of making significant changes in standardised approach for computing RWAs for all three risk areas. These revised standardised approaches them selves will be quite risk sensitive and will be dependent on a number of computational requirements. Further, BCBS has proposed that for those banks which are under advanced approaches, RWAs based on standardised approaches may work as some kind of floor. BCBS is working on calibration of these floors. Banks may need to upgrade their systems and processes to be able to compute capital requirements based on revised standardised approach. Skill development 17. The fourth challenge is skill development. I see this as a requirement both in the supervised entities and within the Reserve Bank. Implementation of the new capital accord requires higher specialised skills in banks. In fact it requires a paradigm shift in risk management. The governance process should recognise this need and make sure that the supervised entity gears up to it. Risk awareness has to spread bank-wide, the manner of doing business that measures risk adjusted returns needs to permeate the system. Top management and the Human Resource Development Policy of banks thus need to get tuned 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 to this requirement. We in the Reserve Bank also need to hone up our skills in regulating and supervising banks under the new system. We see this as an ongoing process and are continuously working towards skill improvement. Governance 18. One can have the capital, the liquid assets and the infrastructure. But corporate governance will be the deciding factor in the ability of a bank to meet the challenges. BCBS has added a separate principle on corporate governance in its core principles for effective banking supervision which were revised in 2012. It is interesting to note that before 2012, there was no separate principle on corporate governance. I think global community is recognising the importance of corporate governance and is trying to fix the issues. Thus while strong capital gives financial strength, it cannot assure good performance unless backed by good corporate governance. Element of conservatism in minimum standards 19. Several speakers mentioned about the super equivalence issue. Let me add my bit to that discussion before I conclude. There is a general feeling that we have put in place a more stringent framework than what Basel Norms require. Of course one would point out to the 9 percent CRAR, the 4.5 leverage ratio, the SLR running parallel with LCR, the higher CCF for OTC derivatives and the like. We need to see this in a context. I have already dealt with the SLR-LCR issue. On capital, all I can say is that in the ultimate analysis, on an aggregate basis, it does not make much difference. We must also appreciate that relatively much longer recovery process of defaulted loans, shorter history of ratings assigned by rating agencies in Indian conditions putting certain constraint on benchmarking them against the international standards, relatively large population of unrated borrowers especially in mid and SME corporate sectors, market risk factors exhibiting more volatilities, etc. add challenges. Besides, Pillar 2 process and related add-on capital requirements is also yet to be fully stabilised. The higher prescription of 9% minimum requirements in comparison to Basel minimum of 8% may be seen in the above context. Moreover, in an economy whose financial system is dominated by banks, one has to build more resilience than if it were not the case. We have also announced two banks as DSIBs based on the criteria of size, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 20. I must add here that the recent Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme of the BCBS did find our regulations to be fully compliant on all issues relating to capital. Such an affirmation that the banks are working in a regulatory environment consistent with global standards is an assurance to the international financial system that they can do business with Indian banks like with any other. It would be instructive to quote the BCBS Chairman2 here “I would like to remind you that the Basel framework is a minimum standard and members are free to go beyond the minimum. We actually encourage that, and most jurisdictions have adopted minimum requirements that exceed the global standard. Super-equivalences are often found in developing and emerging market economies, where banks have a higher risk profile. The local regulators therefore set higher minimum requirements”.                                                  2  Basel III implementation: Progress, pitfalls, and prospects: Keynote speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Chairman, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Governor, Sveriges Riksbank at the High-Level Meeting for the Americas, Lima, Peru, 3–5 November 2014. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Incidentally, it may also be appreciated that we are not the only jurisdiction having prescribed a higher minimum capital standards. Several other jurisdictions, particularly Asian countries, have proposed higher capital adequacy ratios under Basel III as may be seen from Table. 21. Let me conclude now. I began by saying why it is necessary to implement Basel III in India. I looked at the various challenges that it brings but argued that we cannot see any challenge in isolation. The Basel rules seek to make banks more resilient and risk aware. Such a banking system is always better than an unstable one. We cannot overlook the fact that a crisis is better prevented than faced because the aftermath of the crisis is costlier than the incremental cost that one incurs to prevent it. I suppose the deliberations in today’s meet would not be oblivious to this reality. Let me thank you for your attention.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yves Mersch: Medium to long-term priorities of Capital Markets Union (CMU) for the ECB/Eurosystem Panel remarks by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Eurofi conference, Luxembourg, 10 September 2015. *      *      * While the Green Paper has set the right overall objectives of CMU and identified priorities for early action and the measures for the medium- to long-term, CMU needs to be pursued through a higher level of ambition to achieve greater capital markets development and deeper financial integration. 1. To bring about its expected benefits, the CMU should foster and result in a high level of financial integration in capital markets across the EU based on an adequate legal and regulatory framework. This would imply more steps towards greater harmonization of 1. bankruptcy law, 2. company law and 3. taxation of financial products that pose great political challenges. The aim is to ensure that investors have the same costs and equal access to finance irrespective of where they are located in the EU. Ultimately, the supervisory architecture will also warrant revision. The final destination in the path towards CMU will need to include the development of a single rulebook. These elements are key if we are to attain what has been ambitiously coined as CMU. 2. A schedule with clear milestones and deadlines in the upcoming action plan would facilitate implementation. 3. Market-led initiatives to promote capital markets are important but insufficient. Therefore, legislative action in targeted areas is warranted. While bold action towards the completion of the single rulebook for capital markets will be beneficial, a gradual approach to harmonization could be envisaged in those areas where political sensitivities prevent action at EU level in the short term. 4. Sufficient attention should be devoted to safeguarding financial stability, such as in the area of shadow banking. 5. A single rulebook for EU capital markets needs to be complemented with strengthened supervisory convergence, delivering a common implementation and enforcement of rules. 6. Further reducing still existing fragmentation in financial market infrastructures should be at the core of CMU. It needs to be recognized that banks will continue to play an important role for the financing of the real economy and in providing access to capital markets. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Erdem Başçi: Recent economic and financial developments in Turkey Speech by Mr Erdem Başçi, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the press conference for the presentation of the July 2015 Inflation Report, Ankara, 30 July 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. Distinguished Guests, Welcome to the briefing held to convey the main messages of the Inflation Report of July 2015. The report typically summarizes the economic outlook underlying monetary policy decisions, shares our evaluations on macroeconomic developments and presents our medium-term inflation forecasts, which were revised in view of the developments in the last quarter, along with our monetary policy stance. In addition to the main text, the report includes six boxes entailing interesting and up-to-date analyses on various topics. These boxes in the Report look into the information content of credit in explaining inflation, scrutinize the taxation in the Turkish tobacco products market, analyze the export-inflation relationship in food products, examine the use of survey data in short-term GDP forecasts, elaborate on the effect of oil prices on exports, and present information on the government spending multiplier. The titles of the boxes are shown on the slide. All of these analyses shed light on noteworthy issues in the Turkish economy. I strongly recommend that you read these boxes, which will soon be published on our website. I would like to commence my speech by reviewing the global economic outlook, given its undeniable influence on our policies. Global financial markets remained volatile in the second quarter of 2015, which was attributed to the continued divergence among global monetary policies, the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve (Fed)’s normalization plans and developments regarding the Greek debt crisis. In this period, the volatility in long-term rates reached quite high levels, especially across advanced economies (Chart 1), which also affected emerging-market rates. Thus, portfolio flows to emerging-markets weakened (Chart 2). The global economic slowdown of 2014 continued into the first quarter of 2015 largely due to emerging economies. Despite signs of economic recovery in Europe, geopolitical tensions continued to restrain Turkey’s external demand. The volatility across global markets had implications for the Turkish economy as well, causing fluctuations in financial indicators amid domestic uncertainty. In this period of heightened volatility in long-term interest rates of advanced countries and added interest-rate sensitivity in emerging economies, the interest-rate corridor and the tight liquidity policy we have been implementing played a major role in shielding the economy against global shocks. Moreover, our structural and cyclical measures supporting FX liquidity, core liabilities and long-term borrowing strengthened the economy’s resilience.  1.  Monetary policy and financial conditions In view of the uncertainty over global markets and the volatility in food and energy prices, we maintained a cautious monetary stance in the second quarter of 2015. In this period, we kept interest rates unchanged, but continued with the tight liquidity policy to contain risks to core inflation and inflation expectations. To meet the recently growing liquidity need, the weight of marginal funding was increased and, as a result, the CBRT average funding rate increased (Chart 3). The CBRT average funding rate has been hovering around 8.5 percent since mid-June (Chart  4). The BIST Interbank overnight rate, on the other hand, remained close to the upper bound of the corridor as in the previous reporting period.  
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Thanks to the cautious monetary stance, the yield curve remained nearly flat. Although the yield curve has remained basically unchanged since the publication of the previous Inflation Report, there was a slight increase in the market rates with more than two-year maturity (Chart 5). Thus, the spread between the overnight repo rates at the BIST Interbank Money Market and 5-year market rates has narrowed somewhat (Chart 6). I would like to reiterate that we will monitor inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation closely and maintain the cautious monetary policy stance by keeping a flat yield curve until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook in the upcoming period.  The wide interest rate corridor and the tight liquidity policy that we have been implementing reduce the economy’s sensitivity to global shocks, thus supporting financial stability and facilitating the attainment of the price stability objective. In the post-crisis period, the unconventional policies of advanced economies and the ongoing uncertainties over global monetary policies caused long-term interest rates in these economies to fluctuate. In addition, emerging-market rates have become extremely sensitive to global monetary policy developments. To contain repercussions on the Turkish economy, we designed a monetary policy framework composed of a wide interest rate corridor and an active liquidity policy. The CBRT’s wide interest rate corridor and the tight liquidity policy strengthened the resilience of the Turkish economy against global shocks and proved to be effective in pursuing the primary objective of price stability. The wide interest rate corridor enables us to raise short-term rates temporarily above long-term rates when faced with shocks and to keep the yield curve nearly flat or inverted. Accordingly, Turkish lira-denominated long-term rates remain more stable and the economy becomes less sensitive to global long-term interest rate shocks. Moreover, a flat or inverted yield curve constitutes an effective monetary policy stance that supports disinflation. In fact, especially following the strong monetary tightening of early 2014, we all saw that the sensitivity of domestic markets to global interest rates weakened substantially and core inflation indicators have improved significantly (Chart 7). In the upcoming period, following the start of normalization of global monetary policies, volatility in long-term interest rates may decline permanently thanks to forward guidance policies. According to this baseline scenario, the need for a wide interest rate corridor in our country may diminish over time.  In that case, we may simplify the operational framework of the CBRT’s interest rate policy gradually.  In addition to the interest rate corridor and the tight liquidity policy, we continue to make efficient use of the policy tools developed in response to the global financial volatility. These measures we took with regard to the financial system are highly important in encouraging prudential borrowing and minimizing macrofinancial risks amid domestic and external uncertainty. The remuneration of Turkish lira required reserves at different rates depending on core liabilities was effective as of January 2015.  As of the 8 May 2015 maintenance period, we raised the remuneration rate by 50 basis points. Additionally, the rise in FX required reserves ratios to extend the maturity of noncore liabilities appears to have contributed to the recent slowdown in the uptrend of the loan/deposit ratio (Chart 8). Furthermore, the decrease in the share of short-term non-deposit FX liabilities following changes in FX required reserves to stimulate long-term borrowing became more pronounced in the second quarter (Chart 9).   As another measure related to the FX liquidity, we have remunerated the USD denominated required reserves, reserve options and free reserves held at the CBRT as of 5 May 2015. We set and announce the remuneration rate to be applied on a daily basis by taking global and local financial market conditions into account. In addition, we reduced the annual commission rate of 0.02 basis points that had been applied since 1 February 2015 on euro-denominated accounts of banks and financing companies at the CBRT to a yearly 0.005 basis points as of 1 July 2015, and abolished it as of 27 July 2015 due to the recent developments in the euro area. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Thanks to the tight monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures, loan growth continues to stay at reasonable levels. Adjusted for exchange rate changes, loans provided to the non-financial sector increased modestly by 18.1 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2015. A comparison of consumer and commercial loans shows that commercial loans continue to grow more at a higher rate than consumer loans, partly due to BRSA regulations. The annualized growth rate of commercial loans dropped to 15.1 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2015, whereas this rate was 21.6 percent for exchange rate-adjusted commercial loans. Likewise, comparing their growth trend to averages in past years, commercial loans are close to the average whereas consumer loans are significantly below the average (Charts 10 and 11). Due to the moderate economic activity and the recent tightening in financial conditions, loan growth is likely to slow somewhat in the forthcoming period.  2.  Macroeconomic developments and main assumptions Now, I will talk about the macroeconomic outlook and our assumptions on which our forecasts are based. First, I will summarize the recent inflation developments, and then continue with the domestic and foreign demand outlook upon which we based our projections. In the second quarter of 2015, annual consumer inflation declined by about 0.4 points from end-first quarter to 7.20 percent, nearing the forecasts of the April Inflation Report (Charts 12 and 13). This improvement in inflation was mainly attributed to  declining food inflation, while core inflation increased mostly due to exchange rate developments. In this period, the contribution of the food category to annual inflation was down to about 2.3 points amid a correction in food prices. Yet, the depreciation of the Turkish lira limited the decline in inflation.  The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). However, the lagged effects of the recent exchange rate developments delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. In fact, compared to the first quarter there was a notable deterioration in the underlying core inflation trend in the second quarter (Chart 14). This outlook was largely due to exchange rate-driven cost pressures that became stronger than that of the previous period. The cautious monetary stance and the moderate course of domestic demand continued to limit the spillover from cost pressures into prices. As we projected in the April Inflation Report, food prices exhibited a remarkable correction amid the climatic conditions that accommodated supply in the second quarter. Annual food inflation, which makes up around 25 percent of the consumption basket, fell to 9.28 percent in June. Similarly, annual inflation in food and catering services posted a significant decline in this period. Also in this period, consumer inflation excluding food and catering services increased by 1 point to 5.82 percent in the inter-reporting period due to these cost pressures (Chart 15).  To sum up, food prices pulled inflation down in the second quarter, yet the depreciation in the Turkish lira restricted this decline, inhibiting the desired improvement in the inflation outlook. Owing to the expected partial recovery in food prices accompanied by the cautious monetary policy, we project the deterioration in the inflation outlook to remain limited and inflation to reach the target in the medium term. According to the GDP data of the first quarter of 2015, economic activity proved more robust compared to the outlook presented in the April Inflation Report, and the GDP rose by 1.3 and 2.3 percent on a quarterly and annual basis, respectively (Chart 16). An analysis of national income components on the production side indicates that all sectors excluding construction exhibited increases in the first quarter compared to the previous-quarter averages. In this period, agriculture and net tax items regarding the GDP growth stood out, while industry and 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  services maintained their mild trend of increase (Chart 17). Seasonally-adjusted data on the expenditures side reveal that final domestic demand increased owing to the rise in consumption expenditures in the first quarter. Investment expenditures contracted both in the public and the private sectors on a quarterly basis.  According to the data on exports and imports of goods and services, exports posted an increase, but imports declined on a quarterly basis in the first quarter. Foreign trade data excluding gold indicate that the import quantity index posted a steady rise in line with the uptrend in domestic demand in this period, while exports declined amid the weak course of external demand.  Data on the second quarter of 2015 suggest that the economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace. Industrial production rose by 1.0 percent in the April-May period compared to the previous quarter. Combined with the other indicators for June, we expect the industrial production to record a quarterly increase in the second quarter. Sales, production, and import indicators regarding domestic demand show that the final domestic demand will continue with an uptrend stemming from consumption demand. Investment indicators, on the other hand, signal that the weak outlook will remain in the second quarter. The export quantity index excluding gold increased at a modest rate in the April-May period following the contraction in the first quarter, while imports excluding gold maintained their uptrend suggesting that the contribution of external demand to economic growth may be limited in the second quarter (Chart 18). The recovery in economic activity is projected to continue in the upcoming period, yet risks to growth exist. Downside risks regarding external demand persist due to geopolitical developments and troubles in Europe. Moreover, domestic uncertainties, the weak course of the confidence indices, and volatility in financial markets driven by global monetary policies may limit the contribution of final private demand to growth. Despite the existence of these factors keeping the downside risks alive, the robust employment performance following the global crisis along with low oil prices generate room for domestic demand and economic policies by improving the current account balance and the inflation outlook. In addition, the expected correction in the agricultural value added emerges as a factor that may support growth on the production side. Against this background, we project the second half of 2015 to witness a sustained moderate growth and demand conditions that support disinflation. In line with the favorable developments in the terms of trade coupled with the slowdown in consumer loans, the recovery trend in the current account balance is anticipated to continue in the upcoming period; yet the weak course of external demand may limit this recovery to some extent (Chart 19). As you all know, food, energy and import prices also play a great role in inflation forecasts. Therefore, before moving on to forecasts, I will briefly talk about our assumptions regarding these variables. In the second quarter of 2015, oil prices stood slightly above the path projected in the previous report, while USD-denominated import prices remained below projections (Chart 20). On an annual basis, we lowered average oil price assumption by 2 percent for 2015, and by around 6 percent for 2016. Accordingly, we revised assumptions for annual percentage changes in average import prices downwards by 1.7 points for 2015 and 1.4 points for 2016. Developments in food prices show that unprocessed food prices exhibited a notable correction in the second quarter of 2015 and the contribution of food prices to inflation witnessed a significant decline. Due to the projections that this correction will continue and the effects of measures taken by related institutions will materialize, we revised the food inflation assumption for end-2015 downwards from 9 percent to 8 percent. Our medium-term projections are based on the assumption that tax adjustments and administered prices will not exceed inflation targets and be consistent with automatic pricing mechanisms. The medium-term fiscal policy stance is based on the Medium Term Program projections covering the 2015-2017 period. Accordingly, we assume that a cautious fiscal 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  stance will be implemented and the primary expenditures to the GDP ratio will decrease gradually. 3.  Inflation and the monetary policy outlook Now, I would like to present our inflation and output gap forecasts based on the outlook I have described so far. Our medium-term forecasts are based on a framework that a cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained by keeping the yield curve flat until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. Moreover, we envisage that the annual loan growth rate will continue to hover around the recent reasonable levels in 2015, also thanks to the macroprudential measures. Accordingly, we expect inflation will be, with 70 percent probability, between 6.0 percent and 7.8 percent (with a mid-point of 6.9 percent) at end-2015 and between 3.7 percent and 7.3 percent (with a mid-point of 5.5 percent) at end-2016. We estimate that inflation will stabilize around 5 percent in the medium term (Chart 21). In the second quarter of 2015, exchange rate movements delayed the recovery in the core inflation trend, causing the year-end inflation forecast to be raised by 0.5 point. On the other hand, the improvement in import and food prices compared to the previous Report reduced the year-end inflation forecast by 0.1 point and 0.3 point, respectively. As a result, import and food prices are estimated to offset the adverse effects of core inflation figures in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we revised the end-2015 inflation forecast, which was set as 6.8 percent in the April Inflation report, upwards by 0.1 point. We kept the end-2016 inflation forecast, which was 5.5 percent in the previous report, unchanged. Considering that the downward revision in the average oil price assumption will pull down the end-2016 inflation by around 0.1 point, this effect will be compensated for by the effect coming from the rise in inflation forecast for end-2015, so we left the end-2016 inflation forecast intact (Chart 21). We are of the opinion that base effects will continue to determine the course of inflation for the rest of 2015. Accordingly, we envisage inflation to decline until September, and increase slightly in September due to base effects. Then, following a fluctuating course, we project that it will reach 6.9 percent in the year-end. In addition to these forecasts, we discuss alternative scenarios on the inflation outlook and the global economy in the Risks section of the Inflation Report. You can examine the Report for details. While concluding my remarks, I would like to thank all my colleagues who contributed to the Report, primarily those at the Research and Monetary Policy Department as well as the members of the Monetary Policy Committee, and thank every one of you for your participation.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  R Gandhi: Financial consumer (depositor) protection – reflections on some lingering questions Text of the M R Pai Memorial Lecture by Mr R Gandhi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Indian Merchant’s Chamber (IMC), Mumbai, 8 September 2015. *      *      * Assistance provided by Ms Reena Banerjee is gratefully acknowledged. 1. At the outset, let me express my pleasure at being here today with you on the occasion of the M R Pai Memorial Lecture; it is my proud honour to have presented the Eleventh M R Pai Memorial award to Madam Smt K J Udeshi, former Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank and former Chairperson, Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI). It is normal for teachers to be presenting awards and prizes to their students and wards; but it is a strange thing for a student to present an award to his teacher. The M R Pai Foundation has just caused that. As young boys and girls, I am sure, many of you, like me, would have day dreamed to present awards and prizes to our teachers. Today, thanks to the M R Pai Foundation, my such daydream has become a reality. Smt Udeshi has been a mentor to me and many more in the Reserve Bank. With her charming disposition and dedication, her staunch adherence to principles and high values and varied knowledge and expertise, she had been a well-respected coach and mentor; and also a strict disciplinarian. Having been a sports person, she knew the value of playing by rules and importance of fair play. That definitely helped her in being a strict disciplinarian when she was in the Reserve Bank and also during her tenure as the first Chair-person of the BCSBI. I am very grateful to you, Madam, for giving me this privilege to honour you with the M R Pai Memorial Award. 2. As is well known, Shri M R Pai was a multi-faceted personality, but his greatest contribution lay in starting the consumer movement in India. He was active in all areas, and confronted monopolistic giants like the telephone services, the Indian Airlines, and more particularly the banks, earning the title of Champion of the Consumer. Consumer protection and consumer activism has come a long way since those times. The best example of this is in what the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) has said in their Report in 2013. “Consumer protection: A prime motivation of all financial regulation is to protect consumers. The relationship between financial firms and their customers is one where, many times, the outcomes may harm customers. These problems are not sporadic or accidental; but are often rooted in basic problems of information and incentives and will not be alleviated through financial literacy campaigns. The central purpose of financial regulation is to intervene in the relationship between financial firms and their customers, and address market failures. This requires a comprehensive consumer protection framework that covers both the problem of prevention (interventions that induce financial firms towards fair play) and cure (addressing consumer grievances)”. 3. I am sure this is music for the great soul of Shri Pai. I will be discussing the essential elements of, and the need for consumer protection, as well as initiatives taken both globally and in India with specific reference to the financial sector. Consumer protection – role of the Reserve Bank 4. Protection of the interests of the depositors has been one of the mandates of the Reserve Bank. The Banking Regulations Act 1949 is replete with the phrases like “in the interests of depositors” wherever it entrusts powers to the Reserve Bank; be it granting of a banking license or cancellation thereof, giving directions on advances or on any banking matter, applying for suspension, winding up, or amalgamation of banks, approving 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  appointment of CEOs or additional directors, removal of CEOs, all these are to be exercised keeping, among other things, the depositors interests in view. But the services provided by the banking sector today are much more than only deposit services. This rapid increase in the nature of financial services has highlighted the need for robust regulation as well as consumer education to protect and empower consumers. The need to extend provision of banking services to underserved sections of the population whose financial literacy is low, combined with the growing complexity of financial products and the use of technology can increase the risk of mis-selling. Financial consumer protection should be reinforced and integrated with other financial inclusion and financial education policies. If such protection is absent, the benefits to economic growth of expanded financial inclusion may be severely undermined. Financial consumer protection also contributes to strengthening financial stability. Taking these factors into account, Reserve Bank has recently articulated its Core Purpose, Values and Vision as its commitment to the Nation to include regulating markets and institutions under its ambit to ensure financial system stability and consumer protection. 5. Apart from the Reserve Bank, the Government of India has also been concerned with financial consumer protection. The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC), about which I had referred to earlier, was constituted by the Ministry of Finance in March 2011, and was asked to comprehensively review and redraw the legislations governing India’s financial system. In its report submitted to the Ministry of Finance in March 2013, containing a draft Indian Financial Code to replace the bulk of the existing financial laws, consumer protection was also highlighted. 6. The work of the Commission in the field of consumer protection marks a watershed compared with traditional approaches in Indian financial law. It marks a break with the tradition of caveat emptor, the “buyers beware” concept, and moves towards a position where a significant burden of consumer protection is placed upon financial firms. The draft Code first establishes certain basic rights for all financial consumers. In addition, the Code defines what is a unsophisticated consumer, and an additional set of protections are defined for these consumers. The proposed basic protections are: a) Financial service providers must act with professional diligence; b) Protection against unfair contract terms; c) Protection against unfair conduct; d) Protection of personal information; e) Requirement of fair disclosure; f) Redress of complaints by financial service providers. 7. In addition, unsophisticated consumers will have three additional protections: a) The right to receive suitable advice; b) Protection from conflicts of interest of advisors; c) Access to the redress agency for redress of grievances. 8. The regulator will be given an enumerated set of powers through which it must implement these protections. Alongside these objectives and powers, the regulator will also be given a set of principles that guide the use of the powers. 9. The Reserve Bank has welcomed this suggested approach to consumer protection. The draft IFC is currently under examination. Consumer protection – what does it imply and how will it help? 10. Financial consumer protection sets clear rules of conduct for financial firms regarding their retail customers. It aims to ensure that consumers: (1) receive information to 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  allow them to make informed decisions, (2) are not subject to unfair or deceptive practices, and (3) have access to recourse mechanisms to resolve disputes. Complementary financial literacy initiatives are aimed at giving consumers the knowledge and skills to understand the risks and rewards of using financial products and services – and their legal rights and obligations in using them. Clear rules of conduct for financial institutions, combined with programs of financial education for consumers, will increase consumer trust in financial markets and will support the development of these markets1. International initiatives regarding consumer protection – initiatives by International organisations 11. Globally, several initiatives have been taken for consumer protection by both the international standard setting bodies and the regulators. Regarding initiatives taken by standard setting bodies, the G20 requested the OECD / FSB and others to articulate principles on Financial Consumer Protection. These broadly state that financial consumer protection should be an integral part of the legal, regulatory and supervisory framework and there should be equitable and fair treatment of consumers with special attention dedicated to the needs of vulnerable groups. It should include access to adequate complaints handling and redress mechanisms that are accessible, affordable, independent, fair, accountable, timely and efficient. The G20 / OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection is currently focused on supporting the implementation of the High-level Principles. The OECD is workingon how to enhance financial consumer protection, which includes determining what is required to help consumers gain the confidence, knowledge, information, security and choices they need to enable them to fully participate in financial markets. In 2011, the Financial Stability Board published its report on Consumer Finance Protection with particular focus on credit. 12. Consumers International (CI) is a world federation of consumer groups. Recently, CI conducted a global survey of 80 member jurisdictions to assess the state of consumer protection across the world. Key findings include: • Since 2012, Members felt the top three advances they had witnessed in consumer protection were from: new legislation, consumer representation and regulation and enforcement. Increasing consumers’ awareness of their rights was also an important factor. • Members felt that the three main factors that contribute to consumer detriment are: economic and development challenges, lack of regulation and enforcement; and poor quality products and services. Financial Consumer Protection 13. Various national initiatives: a) In USA, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB is authorized to exercise its authority to ensure that: (1) Consumers are provided with timely and understandable information to make responsible decisions about transactions involving consumer financial products and services; (2) Consumers are protected from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices and from discrimination; (3) Outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations concerning consumer financial products and services are regularly identified and                                                 1 Good Practices for financial consumers World Bank June 2012. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  addressed in order to reduce unwarranted regulatory burdens; (4) Federal consumer financial law is enforced consistently, without regard to (service providers’) status as depository institutions, in order to promote fair competition; and (5) Markets for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. b) In UK, the Financial Services Act of 2012 set up the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which is responsible for regulating the consumer credit industry from 1 April 2014, taking over the role from theOffice of Fair Trading. The FCA supervises banks to ensure they treat customers fairly, and encourages innovation and healthy competition. The authority has significant powers, including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products. It is able to specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products. In addition, the FCA is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban; it will have the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading, and to publish such decisions. c) In the European Union, the European Banking Authority (EBA) promotes a transparent, simple and fair internal market for consumers in financial products and services. The EBA seeks to foster consumer protection in financial services across the EU by identifying and addressing detriments consumers may experience, or are at risk of experiencing, in their dealings with financial firms. The role and tasks of the EBA related to consumer protection and financial activities include: collecting, analysing and reporting on consumer trends in the EU; reviewing and coordinating financial literacy and education initiatives; developing training standards for the industry; contributing to the development of common disclosure rules; monitoring existing and new financial activities; issuing warnings if a financial activity poses a serious threat to the EBA’s objectives as set out in the its funding Regulation; and temporarily prohibiting or restraining certain financial activities, provided certain conditions are met. The market is governed by the various directives issued by the EU such as the Directives on Consumer Credit. d) In Hong Kong, the industry-established Code of Banking Practice (CoBP) promotes good banking practices by setting out the minimum standards which financial institutions should follow in their dealings with customers. The Code is a non-statutory one issued by the financial industry associations for voluntary compliance by financial institutions. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) expects financial institutions in Hong Kong to comply with the CoBP and will monitor compliance as part of its regular supervision. There are also examples of international voluntary codes. Consumer protection in India – initiatives by the Reserve Bank 14. Consumer protection has been an ongoing effort of Reserve Bank. For greater effectiveness and a more focused approach, several committees were appointed on aspects of customer service in banks from time to time, including the Talwar Committee (1975), the Goiporia Committee (1990), the Tarapore Committee (2004), the Sadasivan Working Group (2006), and the Damodaran Committee on Customer Service (2010). The importance of consumer protection was also highlighted in the Committee on Financial Sector Reform chaired by Dr Raghuram G. Rajan. The RBI had set up the Banking Ombudsman Scheme to act as a visible and credible dispute resolution agency for common persons utilizing banking services and to ensure redress of grievances of users of banking services in an inexpensive, expeditious and fair manner that provides impetus to improve customer services in the banking sector on a continuous basis. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Some recent initiatives by the Reserve Bank 15. Let me now detail some recent initiatives by the Reserve Bank regarding consumer protection: a) Most important perhaps was the release of a Charter of Customer Rights, which enshrined broad, overarching principles for protection of bank customers and enunciates the “five” basic rights of bank customers. These are: (i) Right to Fair Treatment; (ii) Right to Transparency; Fair and Honest Dealing; (iii) Right to Suitability; (iv) Right to Privacy; and (v) Right to Grievance Redress and Compensation. The Reserve Bank also advised the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) to formulate a “Model Customer Rights Policy” encapsulating the principles enshrined in the Charter. Initially, all the scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks and urban co-operative banks are expected to prepare their own Board approved policy incorporating the five basic rights of the Charter which, among other things, would contain a monitoring and oversight mechanism for ensuring adherence. b) The Reserve Bank of India undertook several measures on KYC, including releasing a note along with a poster and a booklet comprising a few common questions relating to Know Your Customer (KYC) norms for opening bank accounts. The objective of this is to bring awareness among the general public about the KYC simplification measures taken by the Reserve Bank in the recent times with a view to helping the common man in opening bank accounts. c) The measures taken for simplification of KYC include prescribing a single document for proof of identity and proof of address, removing the requirement for separate proof of address for current address, making KYC a bank process rather than a branch process, relaxing the officially valid documents (OVDs) for low risk customers, increasing the time intervals for periodic updation of KYC for existing low / medium and high risk customers from 5/2/1 years to 10/8/2 years, respectively. d) Further, banks need not seek fresh proofs of identity and address at the time of periodic updation, from those customers who are categorised as “low risk”, in case of no change in status with respect to their identities and addresses. A self-certification by the customer to that effect should suffice in such cases. Banks may not insist on physical presence of such low risk customer at the time of periodic updation. Further, if an existing KYC compliant customer of a bank desires to open another account in the same bank, there should be no need for submission of fresh proof of identity and / or proof of address for the purpose. Further, Business Correspondents and Business Facilitators were allowed to act as Customer Service Point (CSP) for e-KYC purpose. e) To mitigate the difficulties faced by transgender persons in opening accounts, banks were directed to include “third gender” in all forms / applications, etc. as a valid classification. f) Initiatives were taken to further enhance transparency in pricing of credit, based on the recommendations of Working Group on Pricing of Credit. Banks were advised to display on their website inter alia, the interest rate range of contracted loans for the past quarter for different categories of advances granted to individual borrowers along with mean interest rates for such loans; the total fees and charges applicable on various types of loans to individual borrower which should also be disclosed at the time of processing of loan for transparency and comparability and to facilitate informed decision making by customers; Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or such similar other arrangement of representing the total cost of credit on a loan to an individual borrower so as to allow customers to compare the costs associated with borrowing across products and / or lenders. Apart from displaying such information, banks were also advised to provide a clear, concise, one page key fact statement / 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  fact sheet, to all individual borrowers at every stage of the loan processing as well as in case of any change in any terms and conditions, which would also be included as a summary box to be displayed in the credit agreement. g) While undertaking insurance distribution business, either under the corporate agency or broking model under the relevant IRDA Regulations, banks were directed to put in place a system of assessment of the suitability of products for customers, and classify products into universally suitable products and complex products which necessarily require customer need assessment prior to sale. It should be ensured that there is a standardized system of assessing the needs of the customer and that initiation / transactional and approval processes are segregated. Banks should treat their customers fairly, honestly and transparently, with regard to suitability and appropriateness of the insurance product sold. There should be no violation either of Section 10(1) (ii) of the BR Act, 1949 or the guidelines issued by IRDA in payment of commissions / brokerage / incentives. This may be factored in while formulating a suitable performance assessment and incentive structure for staff. Further, it must be ensured that no incentive (cash or non-cash) should be paid to the staff engaged in insurance broking / corporate agency services by the insurance company. The bank should not follow any restrictive practices of forcing a customer to either opt for products of a specific insurance company or link sale of such products to any banking product. It should be prominently stated in all publicity material distributed by the bank that the purchase by a bank’s customer of any insurance products is purely voluntary, and is not linked to availment of any other facility from the bank. Further, the details of fees / brokerage received in respect of insurance broking / agency business undertaken by them should be disclosed in the “Notes to Accounts” to their Balance Sheet. A robust internal grievance redressal mechanism should be put in place along with a Board approved customer compensation policy for resolving issues related to services offered. It must also ensure that the insurance companies whose products are being sold have robust customer grievance redressal arrangements in place. Further, the bank must facilitate the redressal of grievances of the customer. h) To encourage the usage of credit and debit cards, Reserve Bank has issued various instructions on security of card transactions and risk mitigation measures, including directions on online alerts as well as on additional factor of authentication which have significantly increased customer confidence in using cards. Some initiatives taken recently are as under: • To avoid inconvenience, the requirement of Additional Factor of Authentication for small value card present transactions was relaxed for customers making small value payments on contactless cards up to a maximum value of ₹ 2,000/- per transaction subject to certain conditions. • Banks were also advised in the interest of customer awareness and protection to clearly explain to customers about the technology, its use, and risks while issuing such contact less cards; indicate the maximum liability devolving on the customer, if any, at the time of issuance of such cards along with the responsibility of the customer to report the loss of such cards to the bank; and to put in place robust mechanism for seamless reporting of lost / stolen cards, which can be accessed through multiple channels. • To further put in place risk mitigation measures for customers using various types of cards, banks are advised that with effect from Feb 1, 2016 all new cards issued – debit and credit, domestic and international – by banks shall be EMV chip and pin based cards. i) To alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners who are deprived of regular pension payments in case of misplacement of life certificates, all agency banks handling 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  government pension payments were advised to issue a duly signed acknowledgement to pensioners on receipt of the life certificate submitted in physical form. Banks were also advised to promote the use of digital life certificates among pensioners, which would eliminate the need for physical presence at branches and issue of acknowledgement. j) To ensure transparency in the promotional material and to build an enduring relationship with the customers, correlate a product brand name to the name of the entity / company authorised under the PSS Act, all authorised entities issuing payment products were advised that all the information available to the public regarding the product as advertisements, on website, application form, etc. should prominently carry the name of the entity / company authorised by RBI under the PSS Act. k) Banks were advised to ensure that penal charges on non-maintenance of minimum balances in savings bank accounts are directly proportionate to the extent of shortfall observed, reasonable and not out of line with the average cost of providing the services that the balance in the savings account does not turn into negative balance solely on account of levy of charges for non-maintenance of minimum balance the bank should notify the customer clearly by SMS / email / letter etc. that in the event of the minimum balance not being restored in the account within a month from the date of notice, penal charges will be applicable. In case the minimum balance is not restored within a reasonable period, which shall not be less than one month from the date of notice of shortfall, penal charges may be recovered under intimation to the account holder. l) To further boost the quality of customer service and to ensure that there is undivided attention to resolution of customer complaints in banks, all public sector banks and select private sector and foreign banks were advised to appoint an internal ombudsman thereby providing a forum available to bank customers for grievance redressal before they approach the Banking Ombudsman. m) Apart from issuing instructions to banks, the Reserve Bank also issues cautionaries to members of the general public. We cautioned members of the public against an app (application) doing rounds on WhatsApp purportedly to facilitate checking of balance in customers’ bank accounts. n) The Reserve Bank of India also cautioned the public against Multi-level Marketing (MLM) activities explaining the functioning of these entities, and advising that falling prey to such offers can result in direct financial losses, apart from the fact that these are cognizable offences under the Prize Chit and Money Circulation (Banning) Act 1978. Some lingering questions 16. I understand that in many a depositor’s mind, several questions linger and they eagerly await the regulator’s response. As I understand, it is not the answer they seek but the rationale and explanation for our actions and the so called “inactions”. It is our duty to explain. Let me discuss some of these contemporary issues and questions. Deposit insurance 17. First issue that I want to discuss relates to deposit insurance. More specifically, the issue relating to increasing the limit on deposit insurance cover. Deposit Insurance protects depositors against the loss of their deposits in case a deposit institution is not able to meet its obligation to the insured depositors. In India, the commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Local Area Banks (LABs) and co-operative banks are covered by deposit insurance. There has been a persistent demand from stakeholders and public representatives in the 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  recent past for a hike in deposit insurance cover from the current level of ₹1 lakh. The Deposit Insurance Systems around the world have evolved over time by reforms adopted by various jurisdictions based on experience, international developments, guidance from supra national bodies like IMF, International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI and other environmental changes from time to time. One of the basic principles of deposit insurance is that the deposit insurance system should cover at least 80% of the deposit accounts and  20–30% of the total assessable deposits. In India, we have surpassed this norm in a substantial way; as on March 31, 2015, our DICGC’s deposit insurance covers as high as 92.3% of the deposit accounts and 31% of the total assessable deposits. 18. Therefore, before deciding on this demand, we have to factor in two major issues viz., the moral hazard issue and the risk based premium issue. Deposit insurance inherently creates a moral hazard i.e. the parties to the deposit insurance viz. a bank and its insured depositors get an incentive to take more risk because the costs of risk, in whole or in part, are borne by others, generally a deposit insurance agency, in our case the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). Most deposit insurance systems initially adopt an ex-ante flat-rate premium system because they are relatively simple to design, implement and administer. However, these systems were open to criticism in that they do not reflect the level of risk that banks pose to the deposit insurance system. Flat-rate premium systems have also been viewed as being unfair as “low-risk” banks are required to pay the same premium as “higher-risk” banks. With no inbuilt incentive for “higher risk” banks to improve their risk profile, a flat rate system would accentuate the moral hazard problem. Therefore the primary objective of most differential premium systems has been to provide incentives for banks to avoid excessive risk taking, minimise moral hazard and introduce more fairness into the premium assessment process. Introducing fairness into the system bolsters industry support for deposit insurance. A hike in cover without calibrating the premium rates to the risk profile of the insured banks only exacerbates the moral hazard. Recognising this, a Committee on Differential Premium System for Banks in India (Chairman: Shri Jasbir Singh) has been constituted by DICGC and has submitted its Report yesterday. We hope that introduction of Risk Based Premium system will make ground for considering raising the insurance cover from the present ceiling of ₹ 1 lakh. Structure of differentiated banks and consumer protection 19. You have noticed that we have recently granted “in principle” licenses to 11 entities to form Payments Banks in the country; and several of you nurture a vague feeling about how these differentiated banks will subserve consumers interests. I want to explain to you how we have carefully structured the regulatory arrangements of these banks from the perspective of consumer protection. 20. As you will recall, consequent to the discussion paper called “Banking Structure in India – The Way Forward”, brought out by the Reserve Bank in August 2013, and the recommendations of the Committee headed by Shri Nachiket Mor, on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low-Income Households to look into the issues relating to financial inclusion, in November 2014 we announced our intention to grant licenses to two types of differentiated banks viz., the Payments Banks and the Small Finance Banks. 21. The objective of setting up of Payments Banks will be to further financial inclusion; the strategies will be by providing (i) small savings accounts and (ii) payments / remittance services to migrant labour workforce, low income households, small businesses, other unorganised sector entities and other users. The scope of the activities permitted for the Payment Banks included a. Acceptance of demand deposits. Payments Bank will initially be restricted to holding a maximum balance of ₹ 1 lakh per individual customer, b. Issuance of ATM / debit cards c. Payments and remittance services through various channels and some ancillary activities. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  22. The deposits collected by them can be only in current or savings account; they cannot accept fixed deposits. The payments banks are prohibited from lending activity. They can deploy the deposits largely in government securities only; a small portion, up to 25% of their deposits, can be held in deposits with other banks. 23. The consumer protection aspects of the design are as follows: The public deposits in the Payments Banks will be covered by the deposit insurance of the DICGC. As the deposit ceiling is ₹ 1 lakh and the deposit insurance ceiling is also ₹ 1 lakh, it means that the depositors of the Payments Banks will be fully insured. Actually, there were arguments why Payments Banks should be covered under deposit insurance, when their assets will be fully in high quality liquid assets of government securities and high credit bank accounts. Still, we concluded that such an assurance as deposit insurance is needed for the depositors of payments banks, as the concept is new and depositors will need additional confidence. 24. As the payments bank may operate in remote areas mostly through BCs, ATMs and other networks, the payments bank will be required to have at least 25 per cent of physical access points including BCs in rural centres. Further, we require that a controlling office for a cluster of access points should also be established for control over various outlets and customer grievance redressal. We have insisted that the bank should have a high powered Customer Grievances Cell to handle customer complaints. The payments banks will also come under the purview of RBI’s Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006. 25. Now, let me explain the arduous process we adopted for granting “in principle” licence. I want to emphasize here that granting banking licenses is not a tick box exercise; it needs to be based on the high regulatory comfort about the “fit and proper” position of those who will manage the bank. Further, banks are high leverage organisations; and whose moneys they leverage? They actually leverage public deposits. Should we not require highest degree of assurance about the entities with whom public moneys can be entrusted? Will this not actually mean, as we said in our Guidelines, licenses shall be issued on a very selective basis. The licensing authority has to apply its mind and exercise judgment. To do this, we had multiple layers of checks so that the exercise is not arbitrary. Actually, we had five layers of assessment – the first round was the preliminary scrutiny by staff based on eligibility criteria, the second round was a detailed analysis of applications by staff after information collection, including from agencies, the third round by an external committee comprising people with high integrity and expertise, the fourth round by the internal committee, and the fifth round by the Committee of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank. We are convinced that our decision to adopt the cautious approach in licensing of payments banks in the initial years is very prudent and sound. 26. Another care that we have taken is to keep intact the difference between authorising financial service providers versus licensing financial product purveyors. The Financial Service Providers do not deal in the consumers’ money; they only render broking, agency and / or advisory services to the consumers. Whereas, the financial product purveyors like the banks, mutual funds and insurance companies, actually receive moneys from the consumers and manage those moneys. This handling of public moneys need a totally different regulatory approach, as compared to handling of servicing the consumers through agency or advisory function. That is why the prudential regulations on the former are much more stringent than the conduct regulations on the latter. It clearly follows that while the liberal authorisations may be possible in the case of service providers, cautious authorisations will be needed in the case of authorisations of banks. 27. We have also announced that we will license Small Finance Banks, another new set of differentiated banks. The objective of setting up of small finance banks, like the payments banks, is also to further financial inclusion; however, it is sought to be achieved through a different set of strategies viz., (i) provision of savings vehicles primarily to unserved and underserved sections of the population, and (ii) supply of credit to small business units; small and marginal farmers; micro and small industries; and other unorganised sector entities, 
   10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  through high technology-low cost operations. The small finance bank, in furtherance of the objectives for which it will be set up, shall primarily undertake basic banking activities of acceptance of deposits and lending to unserved and underserved sections including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and unorganised sector entities. It can also undertake other non-risk sharing simple financial services activities, not requiring any commitment of own fund, such as distribution of mutual fund units, insurance products, pension products, etc. 28. The prudential guidelines for the Small Finance banks have been suitably tweaked. It will be required to extend 75 per cent of its Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to the sectors eligible for classification as priority sector lending (PSL). The maximum loan size and investment limit exposure to a single and group obligor would be restricted to 10 per cent and 15 per cent of its capital funds, respectively. Further, in order to ensure that the bank extends loans primarily to small borrowers, at least 50 per cent of its loan portfolio should constitute loans and advances of up to ₹ 25 lakh. 29. Keeping customer protection requirement in view, we have prescribed that the Small Finance Banks should have high powered Customer Grievances Cell to handle customer complaints and the small finance banks will come under the purview of RBI’s Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006. 30. We have received 72 applications and are in the final stages of determining who all can be granted licenses. At the cost of repetition, I want to emphasize here also that granting banking licenses is not a tick box exercise; it needs to be based on the high regulatory comfort about the “fit and proper” position of those who will manage the bank. The Small Finance Banks are also high leverage organisations, and we require highest degree of assurance about the entities with whom public moneys can be entrusted. Therefore, licences shall be issued on a very selective basis only; we will soon announce grant of licenses to the selected applicants. Market development and customer protection 31. As regulators we often face the dilemma of market development or market innovations versus customer protection. We are still a developing and emerging market; while in several respects we have reached international standards, there are still quite a sizable segments in the financial sector that needs development and innovations. Financial inclusion is a case in point. New ideas need to be encouraged; initial cost which will be typically high needs to be recovered; initial period risks and failures need adequate return and compensation. On the other hand, these compulsions will militate against consumer protection. As regulators, we recognise this dilemma. We did face this dilemma in recent years in the cases of micro finance institutions, the ATMs, credit and debit cards, the electronic fund transfer services like the RTGS and NEFT and even the cash services. We were convinced about the need for expansion of these services and conveniences; we understood the trade-offs between the charges for these services and the consumer interests. Our approach has been a gradual move from facilitating entrenchment of such developments and innovations by ensuring competition and choices for consumers to a fairer treatment of consumers and fair charges. Life in low interest rate regime 32. Now, I would like to paint the scenario that will emerge in our country in the next few years and some preparations that all of us as savers should be undertaking. For a very long period, more specifically in our own living memory of the post-Independence era, India had been going through high inflationary period; of course, thankfully, we never had the hyper inflationary periods like in several African or South American countries; but certainly, our experience of inflation was in high single digits to teens and hence inflationary expectations were very well entrenched. Though we did experience low inflationary levels in some periods, we could not sustain it. For yet another time, we are now experiencing low levels of 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  inflation and it is amply clear that this time around we will be able to sustain it for the years to come. Also, the monetary policy framework agreement that we have with the Government, prescribes that the objective of monetary policy will be to maintain the consumer inflation at four, plus or minus two percent. This gives the necessary assurance and confidence to keep the inflationary expectations at bay. It is heartening to note that influential thinkers now worry about recession. 33. What does this low inflationary period entails for the savers? For one thing, they will realize that the real value of their savings is higher and remains preserved and protected. In periods of low inflation, the real value of money does not change much. However, they will find that the nominal interest rates that they receive will be low, as compared to the interest rates that they enjoyed during the high inflation period. After all, the simple formula for determining interest rate is: Nominal Interest rate = Real Interest rate + Rate of Inflation. 34. As the real interest rate in any economy will be more or less constant, the nominal interest rate is directly proportional to rate of inflation. Thus it will rise when rate of inflation increases and fall when the rate of inflation falls. 35. The uninformed may get worried; it may give rise to an illusion – more specifically in the minds of those who live on fixed interest income; as if their income levels have come down. It is not so; actually, their low nominal interest income will now command and fetch better goods and services, as the real value of their saving and incomes have been preserved. 36. As business and consumer confidence will be higher and better during low inflationary levels, savers will have higher appetite for risk taking. This will mean less reliance on pure fixed interest income; before investing, savers will weigh various financial products of capital market for appropriate risk-reward combination. Savers will increasingly need and seek the services of financial advisers and analysts to help them decide investments. This is the life we must all be prepared for. Conclusion 37. To conclude, let me once again recall what “the uncommon common man’, Shri M R Pai espoused. In his words “most Indians are ignorant of their rights and are therefore taken for a ride”. As regulators, we are conscious of this position and that is why we constantly pay our closer attention on financial consumer protection, more specifically the protection of the vulnerable, defenseless retail consumers. 38. Thank you very much for your patient attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Erkki Liikanen: Monetary policy and its effectiveness Speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at a public lecture at the Croatian National Bank, Zagreb, 10 September 2015. *      *      * Accompanying slides can be found on the Bank of Finland’s website Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to have this opportunity to address you today. At the moment, we are at a very interesting juncture in the economic and monetary developments in the EU and the euro area. The economic conditions of all countries in our continent –big or small, northern or southern – are deeply interconnected, so I believe that we share many of our concerns and interests. It has been a long and arduous journey for the EU and not least the euro area from the crisis of 2008–2009 until today, when at last we see a real promise of economic recovery in the area as well as increasing confidence that a solid foundation for lasting financial stability has been laid. There are a lot of uncertainties, of course, in the global economy, in regional geopolitics, and so on – but there are also signs that economic recovery is underway. So, it is an exciting time and monetary policy is once again an important part of the overall picture. It is my purpose today to concentrate on monetary policy and some related questions. I will survey the monetary policy situation from the point of view of the euro area and from my perspective as a member of the ECB’s governing council. It is useful to start by a review of our recent monetary policy, which is very exceptional by historical standards, both in terms of its strength and its instruments. So, what exactly are we doing? How will it impact the euro area economy? What else needs to be done to ensure a balanced and sustainable recovery? [SLIDE 2] Commitment to accommodative monetary… Commitment to accommodative monetary policy benefits economic outlook The Governing Council of the ECB has taken a series of monetary policy measures to stimulate the euro area economy. The aim of these measures has been to maintain price stability over the medium term. The most recent monetary policy easing cycle, starting from June 2014, consists of several measures. In addition to interest rate policy, we have used so-called non-standard measures in an unprecedented scale. [SLIDE 3] Interest rate policy in 2014 In June and September 2014 the Governing Council of the ECB cut the monetary policy lending rates and decided on a negative deposit facility rate. In consequence monetary policy interest rates are reduced to the zero lower bound. [SLIDE 4] The decisions to support provision of credit in 2014 The Governing Council also introduced two asset purchase programmes, for asset backed securities (ABS) and covered bonds. It also launched a new refinancing facility to encourage banks to increase their lending for productive investments. [SLIDE 5] The decisions on large scale asset purchases and forward… 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In January 2015, the Governing Council judged that there was additional need for easing of the monetary policy stance, as the inflation outlook had weakened further. In this situation we launched the biggest asset purchase programme in Eurosystem history. Through this expanded asset purchase programme, the Eurosystem extended its purchases to bonds issued by euro area governments, government agencies and European institutions. Within this programme, the Eurosystem will buy securities to a value of EUR 60 billion per month until September 2016, or beyond if necessary. Thus, the total purchases will be more than EUR 1,000 billion. Euro area government bonds will make the most of the purchases. The motivation behind the decision to expand purchases to euro-denominated public sector securities was the increasing probability of euro area falling into deflation and the adverse effects stemming from prolonged period with low inflation. The Governing Council of the ECB wanted to prevent price stability objective from losing its role as a firm anchor to inflation expectations and price formation in the euro area. The Governing Council has stated that purchases “are intended to run until the end of September 2016, or beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.” And it has flagged readiness to carry on purchasing more securities if necessary. With this forward guidance the Governing Council indicates its commitment to a monetary policy which will realign inflation with our price stability objective. In January euro area headline inflation was a negative –0.6%, and has hovered around 0.2% over the past few months to August 2015. With nominal short-term interest rates already at the zero lower bound, fading inflation expectations pushed up real interest rates, effectively tightening monetary policy. [SLIDE 6] Large scale asset purchases stimulate Large scale asset purchases stimulate both demand and inflation The two main channels of effect for large-scale asset purchases – often referred to in the literature – are the signalling effect and the portfolio balance effect. [SLIDE 7] Signalling and portfolio balance effects of a large-scale… The signalling effect contributes to stronger anchoring of inflation expectations in line with the medium-term objective of price stability. This effect also contributes to reducing anticipated real rates. Depending on the monetary policy reactions in the rest of the world, the signalling can also put downward pressure on exchange rates. The portfolio balance effect broadens the effects of the securities purchases to the whole financial system even if only a comparatively narrow range of high-quality securities are purchased by the central bank. With this effect, investors are encouraged to shift holdings into other asset classes – e.g. from sovereign to corporate bonds, from debt to equity, and across jurisdictions. This has an indirect effect on the prices and required rates of return in the financial markets as a whole. [SLIDE 8] ECB’s accommodative monetary policy Overall, the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy lowers real interest rates and eases financial conditions in the economy, boosting demand. Consumption increases and the lower cost of debt finance, reduced cost of equity and weaker exchange rates in combination contribute to making some investment projects profitable that were previously deemed unattractive. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  This supports private consumption through various channels. Also, the lower cost of debt finance, reduced cost of equity finance, and the weaker exchange rate all contribute to making investment projects more profitable. [SLIDE 9] Divergence in monetary policy cycles has weakened the euro The divergence in international monetary policy cycles is putting downward pressure on the external value of the euro. This development is partly a result of tightening monetary policy expectations on the other side of the Atlantic. [SLIDE 10] Renewed decline in oil price puts downward pressure… Conditions in wide spectrum of asset markets have developed broadly as intended when the current cycle of monetary policy easing. However, the slowdown in emerging markets and recent sharp fluctuations in financial and commodity markets have brought some downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. The renewed decline in oil price puts downward pressure on inflation in the short run. [SLIDE 11] Commitment to accommodative monetary policy stance… Commitment to the accommodative monetary policy stance supports inflation expectations, thereby lowering the real interest rate. More recently, renewed downside risks have emerged and inflation expectations have decreased. However, owing to sharp fluctuations in financial and commodity markets, the Governing Council judged it premature to conclude whether these developments could have a lasting impact on the outlook for prices, or whether they should be considered to be mainly transitory. [SLIDE 12] Sharp fall in long-term bond yields… The ECB’s asset purchase programme has already led to lower reference interest rates over the whole maturity spectrum and is gradually resulting in more favourable borrowing conditions for non-financial corporations and households. Despite somewhat higher bond yields recently, borrowing conditions remain favourable and loan dynamics are expected to improve. [SLIDE 13] Stock market turbulence in August A policy of quantitative easing boosts property prices and stock markets. In August, however, equity prices fell sharply in China and also globally as the uncertainty over the state of the Chinese economy increased. This has sent jitters in the stock markets through the world. It remains to be seen whether the uncertainty is increased in a more permanent fashion. [SLIDE 14] Monetary policy transmission to the real economy… Monetary policy transmission to the real economy is improving The expanded asset purchases began only at the beginning of March. The full impact of our measures, especially if accompanied by firm actions by other policymakers, will be seen in the months and years ahead. While we have already seen a substantial effect from our measures on bond yields and asset prices, what ultimately matters is when there is an equivalent effect on investment, consumption and inflation. [SLIDE 15] Monetary policy measures support bank lending 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Recovery in bank lending and the strengthening of other sources of finance are important factors working for the current monetary policy in the euro area. Our policies are also improving the credit channel, confirmed by the fact that credit to the private sector is at last gradually picking up. The ECB’s monetary policy measures enhance financial intermediation in a number of ways. They lower funding costs for banks, which should make lending cheaper and more profitable, thereby boosting the volume of lending. And the banks benefit from the measures via their positive impact on the real economy. An improving real economy will eventually be reflected in expanding balance sheets and improved profitability as, for example, the share of non-performing loans in the loan stock declines. At the same time, banks’ credit risks will decline, making it easier for them to increase lending. [SLIDE 16] Monetary policy transmission to non-financial corporations… These extraordinary monetary policy measures have contributed to a broad-based easing in financial conditions and more favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households. They support economic activity in all of the euro area countries, especially in those having suffered most from stressed conditions in recent years but having at the same time executed substantial structural measures to improve the performance in the longer run. [SLIDE 17] Corporate bond yields remain low… The importance of market funding for non-financial corporations is increasing in the euro area. The asset purchases support the corporate bond markets, as investors selling government bonds are expected to switch to higher-risk corporate bonds, reflecting the portfolio balancing effect. Corporate bond yields reached a record low in the euro area in early 2015. Although corporate emissions have partially compensated for the decline in bank lending in the case of large corporations, SMEs do not have the same access to alternative sources of funding and are therefore still highly dependent on bank lending. [SLIDE 18] Average interest rates on new housing loans… From the perspective of achieving price stability it is vital that monetary policy measures have a positive effect not just on corporate expenditure, but also household expenditure. [SLIDE 19] The recovery in the euro area is expected to continue The recovery in the euro area is expected to continue [SLIDE 20] ECB staff projections in September As a result of the accommodative monetary policy measures, the inflation and growth outlook have improved. The information available in September indicates a continued though somewhat weaker economic recovery and a slower increase in inflation rates compared with earlier expectations. The recovery will be supported by domestic dynamics, while the external environment has become less favourable. Despite downward revision, ECB staff projections published last week still point to a sustained recovery leading to a real growth rate of 1.8%.% in 2017. [SLIDE 21] Inflation outlook subdued 2015–2016 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Inflation is expected to remain very low but is projected to rise over the projection horizon, reaching 1.7% in 2017. The projection for HICP inflation also entails a downward revision, largely due to lower oil prices. [SLIDE 22] Finland falls further behind euro area growth The accommodative monetary policy is beneficial to both the euro area and the Finnish economy. The Bank of Finland has assessed the impact of the expanded asset purchase programme on the Finnish economy. According to these calculations, lower interest rates and a weaker exchange rate will increase the GPD growth rate in Finland by 0.3 percentage points in two years. However, Finland has fallen further behind euro area growth as exports have suffered and the labour market situation has deteriorated. Unfortunately, Finland is not expected to reach the pace of the recovery in the rest of the euro area in the near term. [SLIDE 23] Financial stability risks and macroprudential policy Financial stability risks and macroprudential policy While the current monetary policy measures are necessary for the ECB to achieve its primary objective of maintaining price stability and to ensure that inflation does not remain too low for too long, the current monetary policy stance may also have unintended side-effects on the financial system. A key concern is that a prolonged period of very accommodative monetary policy could result in a misallocation of resources that would ultimately undermine financial stability. [SLIDE 24] The mandate of the ECB The Eurosystem’s primary objective is to maintain price stability, and monetary policy decisions are based on the assessment of the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole. Higher risks to financial stability should be addressed primarily through domestic so-called macroprudential policy in the different member countries. In a single currency area, macroprudential policies are particularly important for dealing with sectoral and regional risks that cannot be accounted for by the single monetary policy. Macroprudential policy therefore provides a much needed instrument for mitigating financial stability risks and thereby supporting the price-stability-focused monetary policy. [SLIDE 25] The ECB’s role in the new supervisory architecture From the perspective of financial stability, the euro area is now in a substantially better position than a few years ago. We are now operating in a new regulatory and supervisory environment. In November last year, the ECB took over responsibility for supervising banks in the countries belonging to the Banking Union. It is less well-known that, at the same time, the ECB became the ultimate macroprudential decision-maker in the Union. [SLIDE 26] The ECB reinforces but cannot substitute… More specifically, the ECB can apply higher requirements for specific macroprudential tools than proposed by the designated national macroprudential authorities, if it deems that the suggested national measures are inadequate. In contrast to the single monetary policy, macroprudential policy in the Banking Union is a joint responsibility between different authorities. The main responsibility in macroprudential policy lies with national authorities. They are in the best position to detect country-specific systemic risks and take appropriate measures to address them. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The role of the ECB in macroprudential policy is to enhance national policies and reduce the inaction bias inherent in taking potentially unpopular and intrusive national actions. The ECB will help to identify potential financial stability risks and foster a coordinated stance for macroprudential policies among the euro area Member States. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), in turn, monitors the development of EU-wide cross-border and cross-sectional systemic risks and provides guidance and recommendations to the national authorities. [SLIDE 27] Macroprudential policy is important in a time of… A necessary precondition for successful macroprudential policies – both at a national level and for the Banking Union as a whole – is the availability of sufficient macroprudential toolkits. Importantly, the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRR/CRD IV) provide the ECB and the national authorities with a common minimum set of macroprudential tools for the banking sector. These include countercyclical capital buffer requirements, capital surcharges for systemically important institutions and minimum risk weights for real estate exposures, for example. However, in most euro area countries, the national toolkits should be strengthened. For example, in many countries the tools for containing excesses in housing markets and for building resilience against the realization of housing-related risks are not strong enough. In addition, we should develop new tools to address systemic risks potentially developing in the shadow banking sector. The availability of strong national macroprudential toolkits and the courage to use these tools are of utmost importance in the current environment of very low interest rates. The ECB’s Governing Council is closely monitoring any potential risks to euro area financial stability, including those from excessive risk-taking. Currently, these risks are contained. Should they emerge, macroprudential policy would be best suited to address them. It is clear that much work remains to be done to make the European financial system safer. We need to evaluate the sufficiency of the toolkits of the national authorities and the ECB, as well as learning how to use the new tools most effectively; this is a work in progress and should continue. But we are taking important steps in the right direction. [SLIDE 28] Transparency improves the accountability… Transparency improves the accountability and effectiveness of monetary policy In January this year, when the Governing Council decided to expand its asset purchase programme, it also decided to publish a summary of that meeting’s deliberations before the next monetary policy meeting. The days of ‘never excuse, never explain’ and central banks acting as opaque and secretive institutions were over for good. [SLIDE 29] Transparency, accountability and efficiency:.. A high degree of transparency is an important tool for an independent central bank like the ECB, as it facilitates accountability. We are accountable to achieve our mandate, price stability. By explaining the reasoning behind our monetary policy decisions and helping a better understanding of monetary policy we make it easier to attain our objective, facilitating efficiency. In mid-2013, by introducing forward guidance and through 2014 conveying the Governing Council’s ‘reaction function’ we increased our influence over the shape of the yield curve. When we had decided on our purchase programme in January, long-term nominal interest rates declined, as we had communicated our reaction function and the markets understood it. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Most recently, and going forward, President Mario Draghi has clarified our reaction function by discussing the conditions that will determine the duration and intensity of our expanded asset purchase programme, above and beyond our expressed intention to carry out our purchases until end-September 2016. We have emphasized that we will evaluate the likelihood for inflation not only to converge to levels that are closer to 2%, but also to stabilize around those levels with sufficient confidence thereafter. The decision to publish an account of our monetary policy meetings was preceded by long and thorough discussions by the Governing Council. As we have been increasingly resorting to unconventional measures to meet our mandate, we decided that we need to be more open with the public about how we reached our decisions. At the same time, we felt that even differences of views can be communicated without compromising the credibility and singleness of our monetary policy. Such differences are quite normal and should exist in any committee having meaningful and analytical discussions. The accounts we decided to start publishing are intended to provide a richer summary and convey the flavour of the discussion among Governing Council members. This implies that in reporting on our monetary policy deliberations the independence of the members of the Governing Council must not be put at risk. At the same time, it is also very important to us to preserve the collegiality of our deliberations. That is why we do not attribute positions to individual Council members. In our view, providing a fair and balanced summary of the main arguments put forward was the best way to achieve this. The language we use reflects our collegiate, consensus-oriented mode of discussion and decision-making. And not publishing a voting record allows members to support the decision of the committee, even if they may have personally preferred a different course of action. [SLIDE 30] Thank you! Let me conclude. The economic recovery in the euro area is proceeding, albeit at a slower pace than expected. ECB policies are working, as underlying economic conditions are improving despite recent financial and commodity market volatility. Other policymakers, such as national governments are responsible for their own efforts to strengthen the euro area economies and their growth potential in the medium to longer term. This will be achieved mainly by implementing structural reforms based on each country’s own needs and capabilities. The Governing Council will closely monitor all relevant incoming information. It emphasizes the willingness and ability to act, by using all the instruments available within its mandate and, in particular, recalls that the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size, composition and duration of the programme. In the meantime, we will fully implement our monthly asset purchases of €60 billion per month. These purchases have already had and will continue to have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. As I already noted, we have taken a decidedly medium-term approach, as reflected in our commitment to continue our asset purchases until the end of September 2016, or beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our definition of price stability. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Barry Whiteside: Promoting financial inclusion in Fiji Opening remarks by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the launch of the Financial Services Demand-Side Survey Report, Suva, 17 September 2015. *      *      * Salutations The Australian High Commissioner, Ms Margaret Twomey The UN Resident Representative, Ms Osnat Lubrani The UNCDF Executive Secretary, Ms Judith Karl Excellencies and Members of the Diplomatic Corps Distinguished guests Our Financial Inclusion partners and stakeholders Members of the Media Ladies and Gentlemen Welcome and Introduction Bula vinaka and a very good afternoon to you all. It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the official launch of the Demand-Side Survey Report on Financial Services in Fiji. Thank you for taking the time to share this milestone event in our financial inclusion journey. After months of collaboration between the Reserve Bank and our partners, the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme, the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, the Fiji Bureau of Statistics and other key stakeholders, the final version of the Report is now ready to be unveiled. Many of you present here will know that our financial inclusion journey effectively started back in late 2009 and early 2010, with the setting up of our National Financial Inclusion Taskforce following a gathering of interested stakeholders. These stakeholders agreed to commit to an end-goal of helping our people to improve their lives and those of their families by providing easier access to financial services along with the necessary knowledge and skills to best utilize them. At the time we made a joint commitment to reach 150,000 unbanked or underserved Fijians by the year 2014. This was a priority goal of our first medium term National Financial Inclusion Strategy, which also included incorporating financial education into the Fijian schools’ curriculum. It was extremely pleasing to note that both these targets were achieved well before the end of 2014. Collaboration and partnership with all stakeholders has clearly been the key to our success and this must be recognized. And as Taskforce Chairman I would like to say how grateful I am for the total support given to me and to the Reserve Bank by the financial institutions, government ministries, civil society and donor agencies – all our stakeholder partners. We share a common vision of making Fiji a better place for all our people. But while there have been some key achievements in the past few years, we believe that much more remains to be done to promote and facilitate financial inclusion in Fiji. We are now in the process of formulating our 2nd Medium Term Financial Inclusion Strategy which will embrace the inclusive consultative process we have adopted. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Data initiatives and what led to demand-side survey Ladies and gentlemen, the availability and appropriate usage of data is paramount in any effective decision making process. We are aware that many countries are struggling to get a handle on their financial inclusion development because of the lack of both supply-side and demand-side data. For us in Fiji a key ingredient for our new strategy will be the data we have been collecting over the years and from the recent Demand Side Survey. Unlike when we first started out on this journey, we now have a very comprehensive data set available to construct a complete picture of our financial inclusion initiatives and we can see where the gaps exist. Traditionally, as regulators through our supervision activities, we receive supplyside data from our licenced financial institutions. Data from the supply-side will tell us how many accounts there are, the types of accounts, the geographical spread, numbers of access points and network coverage, and so on. Demand-side data, however, are from the consumers or users and are generally gleaned through household surveys. Such data, while also telling us the numbers of people with accounts, will provide us a bit more on the ease of access and the barriers to use of financial services from the public’s point of view. This data gives us a good picture of the percentage of adults in Fiji with a formal bank account and those that are excluded from the formal sector and the reasons behind exclusion. At this point I would like to recognise Bankable Frontier Associates, a consulting firm based in the USA, which we commissioned to help conduct the demand side exercise. These consultants worked closely with the Reserve Bank of Fiji, the Bureau of Statistics, the National Financial Inclusion Taskforce’s Statistics Working Group and the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme, to develop the questionnaire, train the survey team and deliver the final report. Demand-side survey Ladies and Gentlemen, the Demand-Side Survey Report that we are launching today provides us with an overall view of access, usage and to some extent, the quality of financial services and products, both formal and informal, amongst Fiji’s adult population. This report is very helpful for regulators and the financial service providers to better understand the situation or reality on the ground, particularly the barriers that are preventing people from using the formal financial system. The Survey covered a national representative sample of 1284 respondents through 15 Provinces in Fiji. All the respondents were 15 years of age and above. Key takeaways from the DSS A brief examination of the results suggest that, overall, our level of access to a formal bank account in Fiji is low when compared to upper-middle income1 countries surveyed as part of the World Bank’s Global Findex – though it compares well to middle income countries. Please allow me to highlight some of the key findings: • 60 percent of adults have a bank account while 27 percent are completely excluded from any type of financial service.                                                 1  2014 data from World Bank: Upper middle income countries GNI per capita is $4,086 to $12,615. Fiji’s GNI per capita is $4302 in 2013. Using GDP 2014 is $4543. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  • Financial Inclusion is lower: in the Eastern and Western provinces of Fiji; among women; iTaukei adults; young adults (aged between 15–20 years); and among agricultural and casual workers. • 71 percent of adults saved some money during the previous year, compared with 63 percent of adults in upper middle-income countries in the Global Findex Survey. However out of the 71 percent of adults that say they saved in the past year, only 38 percent saved with a formal financial institution and 9 percent with saving clubs. Additionally, 27 percent of the respondents have retirement savings; but these were found to be more with the urban dwellers. • Use of credit in Fiji is lower, at 32 percent, in comparison to upper-middle income countries at 38 percent. The report highlights that those in the informal strand use shop credit; hire purchases and borrowing from family and friends more than those that are banked. • Moving forward Overall, the demand-side survey report presents some interesting findings and good baseline data for us all on access, usage and the quality of financial services and products offered in Fiji. This data, apart from serving as a benchmark for future reference, will now assist us in developing evidence-based polices and charting the way forward for financial inclusion in Fiji. Ladies and gentlemen, a national workshop will be convened soon to invite stakeholders to participate in reviewing the findings and the achievements of the past five years and to agree upon a new financial inclusion strategy for Fiji for the next five years. Before I conclude, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Fiji Bureau of Statistics. This exercise is precious to us all and required extensive investment, both technically and institutionally, and we are grateful to the Bureau for the unrelenting support throughout. I must also thank our funding partners, the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, for covering the consultant’s fee and the Australian Government which provided the funding through the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme for the data collection exercise. These surveys are very costly and we greatly appreciate the commitment and continuous financial support from our partners. Thank you to all our other committed stakeholders and to my staff at the Reserve Bank who continue to push us onwards in order that we may meet our goals. Finally, let me share with you some great news. Fiji has just been selected to host the 2016 Alliance for Financial Inclusion Global Policy Forum. At the last count, the Alliance had a membership of around 95 emerging and developing countries represented by 123 institutions, including many central banks and finance ministries. We have been told that we can expect more than 600 delegates to fly into Nadi in September next year. This will be a tremendous challenge for us as hosts but a great opportunity to showcase, not only our beautiful country, but also our collaborative effort and growing footprint in financial inclusion. I look forward to all your continued commitment to giving our people in Fiji that lift or hand-up towards a better life. Vinaka vaka levu. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Janet L Yellen: Inflation dynamics and monetary policy Speech by Ms Janet L Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts, 24 September 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank Michael Ash for his kind introduction and the University of Massachusetts for the honor of being invited to deliver this year’s Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture. In my remarks today, I will discuss inflation and its role in the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy. I will begin by reviewing the history of inflation in the United States since the 1960s, highlighting two key points: that inflation is now much more stable than it used to be, and that it is currently running at a very low level. I will then consider the costs associated with inflation, and why these costs suggest that the Federal Reserve should try to keep inflation close to 2 percent. After briefly reviewing our policy actions since the financial crisis, I will discuss the dynamics of inflation and their implications for the outlook and monetary policy. Historical review of inflation A crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation, the average rate of increase in the prices of a broad group of goods and services. Keeping inflation stable at a moderately low level is important because, for reasons I will discuss, inflation that is high, excessively low, or unstable imposes significant costs on households and businesses. As a result, inflation control is one half of the dual mandate that Congress has laid down for the Federal Reserve, which is to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. The Federal Reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability element of its mandate. The dashed red line in figure 1 plots the four-quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) – the measure of inflation that the Fed’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, uses to define its longer-run inflation goal.1 Starting in the mid-1960s, inflation began to move higher. Large jumps in food and energy prices played a role in this upward move, but they were not the whole story, for, as illustrated here, inflation was already moving up before the food and energy shocks hit in the 1970s and the early 1980s.2 And if we look at core inflation, the solid black line, which excludes food and energy prices, we see that it too starts to move higher in the mid-1960s and rises to very elevated levels during the 1970s, which strongly suggests that something more than the energy and food price shocks must have been at work. A second important feature of inflation over this period can be seen if we examine an estimate of its long-term trend, which is plotted as the dotted black line in figure 1. At each point in time, this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the level to                                                 1  See the Federal Open Market Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (PDF), available on the Board’s website. 2  The first jump in energy prices in the 1970s reflected a rise in crude oil prices whose proximate cause was the so-called Arab oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli War; the first jump in food prices was caused by disease and poor harvests combined with low levels of inventories (particularly for grains) in many countries. The second energy price shock resulted from a jump in crude oil prices following the 1978–79 revolution in Iran and subsequent Iraqi invasion; the second food price shock was largely attributable to bad weather and disease. (See Blinder and Rudd, 2013, for an assessment of the effect that these and other special factors – including the imposition and removal of price controls over the 1971–74 period – had on consumer price inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.) 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  which inflation is projected to return in the long run once the effects of any shocks to the economy have fully played out.3 As can be seen from the figure, this estimated trend drifts higher over the 1960s and 1970s, implying that during this period there was no stable “anchor” to which inflation could be expected to eventually return – a conclusion generally supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation. Today many economists believe that these features of inflation in the late 1960s and 1970s – its high level and lack of a stable anchor – reflected a combination of factors, including chronically overheated labor and product markets, the effects of the energy and food price shocks, and the emergence of an “inflationary psychology” whereby a rise in actual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation. Together, these various factors caused inflation – actual and expected – to ratchet higher over time. Ultimately, however, monetary policy bears responsibility for the broad contour of what happened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the Federal Reserve was insufficiently focused on returning inflation to a predictable, low level following the shocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances. In late 1979, the Federal Reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy to reduce inflation. In response to this tightening, which precipitated a severe economic downturn in the early 1980s, overall inflation moved persistently lower, averaging less than 4 percent from 1983 to 1990. Inflation came down further following the 1990–91 recession and subsequent slow recovery and then averaged about 2 percent for many years. Since the recession ended in 2009, however, the United States has experienced inflation running appreciably below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, in part reflecting the gradual pace of the subsequent economic recovery. Examining the behavior of inflation’s estimated long-term trend reveals another important change in inflation dynamics. With the caveat that these results are based on a specific implementation of a particular statistical model, they imply that since the mid-1990s there have been no persistent movements in this predicted long-run inflation rate, which has remained very close to 2 percent. Remarkably, this stability is estimated to have continued during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the unemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the 1981–82 downturn, when the trend did shift down markedly.4 As I will discuss, the stability of this trend appears linked to a change in the behavior of long-run inflation expectations – measures of which appear to be much better anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an improvement in the conduct of monetary policy. In any event, this empirical analysis implies that, over the past 20 years, inflation has been much more predictable over the longer term than it was back in the 1970s because the trend rate to which inflation was predicted to return no longer moved around appreciably. That said, inflation still varied considerably from year to year in response to various shocks. As figure 2 highlights, the United States has experienced very low inflation on average since the financial crisis, in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has proven difficult to fully counter with monetary policy. Overall inflation (shown as the dashed red line) has averaged only about 1–1/2 percent per year since 2008 and is currently close to zero. This result is not merely a product of falling energy prices, as core inflation (the solid black line) has also been low on average over this period.                                                 3  The predicted long-run trend shown here updates an estimate made by Peneva and Rudd (2015), which uses a vector autoregression (VAR) with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility to compute a stochastic trend for inflation (see that paper for additional details regarding model specification and data definitions). The estimation procedure for the VAR is similar to that used by Clark and Terry (2010), which in turn follows Cogley and Sargent (2005); see also Cogley and others (2010) and Ascari and Sbordone (2014) for related applications. 4  Trend inflation estimates from univariate statistical models manifest somewhat less stability in recent years; see Clark and Bednar (2015). 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Inflation costs In 2012 the FOMC adopted, for the first time, an explicit longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE price index.5 (Other central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, also have a 2 percent inflation target.) This decision reflected the FOMC’s judgment that inflation that persistently deviates – up or down – from a fixed low level can be costly in a number of ways. Persistent high inflation induces households and firms to spend time and effort trying to minimize their cash holdings and forces businesses to adjust prices more frequently than would otherwise be necessary. More importantly, high inflation also tends to raise the after-tax cost of capital, thereby discouraging business investment. These adverse effects occur because capital depreciation allowances and other aspects of our tax system are only partially indexed for inflation.6  Persistently high inflation, if unanticipated, can be especially costly for households that rely on pensions, annuities, and long-term bonds to provide a significant portion of their retirement income. Because the income provided by these assets is typically fixed in nominal terms, its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly quickly if inflation turns out to be consistently higher than originally anticipated, with potentially serious consequences for retirees’ standard of living as they age.7  An unexpected rise in inflation also tends to reduce the real purchasing power of labor income for a time because nominal wages and salaries are generally slow to adjust to movements in the overall level of prices. Survey data suggest that this effect is probably the number one reason why people dislike inflation so much.8 In the longer run, however, real wages – that is, wages adjusted for inflation – appear to be largely independent of the average rate of inflation and instead are primarily determined by productivity, global competition, and other nonmonetary factors. In support of this view, figure 3 shows that nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation over long periods of time. Inflation that is persistently very low can also be costly, and it is such costs that have been particularly relevant to monetary policymakers in recent years. The most important cost is that very low inflation constrains a central bank’s ability to combat recessions. Normally, the FOMC fights economic downturns by reducing the nominal federal funds rate, the rate charged by banks to lend to each other overnight. These reductions, current and expected, stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longer-term real interest rates – that is, nominal                                                 5  In contrast, the FOMC has determined that a number of considerations preclude it from setting a fixed numerical target for the other leg of its dual mandate, maximum employment. As discussed in its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (see note 1), the maximum level of employment is something that is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. Moreover, the maximum level of employment, the longer-run “natural” rate of unemployment, and other related aspects of the labor market are not directly observable, can change over time, and can only be estimated imprecisely. As a result, views vary about what labor market conditions would be consistent with a normal level of resource utilization. 6  For a general survey of the costs of high inflation, see Briault (1995). English (1999) discusses costs associated with an increased need for cash management. For a discussion of costs that arise through interactions of inflation with the tax system, see Feldstein (1997, 1999) and Cohen and others (1999). Finally, high inflation may adversely affect the economy’s allocation of resources by increasing the magnitude of misalignments in relative prices that result because firms do not continually adjust all of their prices; for a discussion of such costs in the context of the new-Keynesian model of inflation, see Ascari and Sbordone (2014). 7  More broadly, if inflation evolves in an unpredictable manner over many years, then even financially sophisticated households and firms may not be able to avoid significant forecasting errors with their attendant costs. Such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations; for instance, any firm, union, or other entity that engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or decreases in inflation, although those on the other side of the contract might benefit. 8  For more on this survey, see Shiller (1997).

But the federal funds rate and other nominal interest rates cannot go much below zero, since holding cash is always an alternative to investing in securities.9 Thus, the lowest the FOMC can feasibly push the real federal funds rate is essentially the negative value of the inflation rate. As a result, the Federal Reserve has less room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low. This limitation is a potentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great Recession may require pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full employment at a satisfactory pace.10 For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation objective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent with the other leg of the FOMC’s mandate, to promote maximum employment.11  An unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly because it increases the debt burdens of borrowers. Consider homeowners who take out a conventional fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation that inflation will remain close to 2 percent and their nominal incomes will rise about 4 percent per year. If the economy were instead to experience chronic mild deflation accompanied by flat or declining nominal incomes, then after a few years the homeowners might find it noticeably more difficult to cover their monthly mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated. Moreover, if house prices fall in line with consumer prices rather than rising as expected, then the equity in their home will be lower than they had anticipated. This situation, which is sometimes referred to as “debt deflation,” would also confront all households with outstanding student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as businesses that had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.12 Of course, in this situation, lenders would be receiving more real income. But the net effect on the economy is likely to be negative, in large part because borrowers typically have only a limited ability to absorb losses. And if the increased debt-service burdens and declines in collateral values are severe enough to force borrowers into bankruptcy, then the resultant hardship imposed on families, small business owners, and laid-off workers may be very severe.13                                                  9  Because of the inconvenience of storing and protecting very large quantities of currency, some firms are willing to pay a premium to hold short-term government securities or bank deposits instead. As a result, several foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal short-term interest rates somewhat below zero. 10  For example, Curdia and others (2014) estimate that stabilizing the economy during the last recession would have required lowering the real federal funds rate to negative 10 percent for a time; by comparison, the average value of the real federal funds has been only negative 1-1/4 percent since early 2009. Of course, the FOMC was able to use other policy tools, such as large-scale asset purchases, to put additional downward pressure on long-term interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero; however, those policies had potential costs and risks that made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest rate policy. See Krugman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) for discussions of the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates have on a central bank’s ability to stimulate the economy during economic downturns. In addition, see English, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for model-based analyses of the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance in mitigating the effects of the zero lower bound. Finally, for a discussion of the costs and benefits of employing large scale asset purchases, see Bernanke (2012) and Yellen (2013). 11  For a further discussion of this point, see Mishkin (2007). 12  See Fisher (1933) for an early discussion of debt deflation and its effects on the economy. 13  Very low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important way in which the labor market can respond to adverse shocks. In sectors where productivity is lagging or demand is slowing, declines in real wages might be necessary to avoid even worse outcomes, such as layoffs. For various reasons, however, employers often try to avoid nominal wage cuts. (Bewley (1999) suggests a number of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have on employee morale. Inflation is therefore often said to “grease the wheels of the labor market” because it permits these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal wages and rising prices.) But when inflation falls to a very low level, this passive approach to wage reductions may no longer be viable for many firms, causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to fall on employment. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Monetary policy actions since the financial crisis As I noted earlier, after weighing the costs associated with various rates of inflation, the FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational definition of its longer-run price objective.14 In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, however, achieving both this objective and full employment (the other leg of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate) has been difficult, as shown in figure 4. Initially, the unemployment rate (the solid black line) soared and inflation (the dashed red line) fell sharply. Moreover, after the recession officially ended in 2009, the subsequent recovery was significantly slowed by a variety of persistent headwinds, including households with underwater mortgages and high debt burdens, reduced access to credit for many potential borrowers, constrained spending by state and local governments, and weakened foreign growth prospects. In an effort to return employment and inflation to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, the FOMC took a variety of unprecedented actions to help lower longer-term interest rates, including reducing the federal funds rate (the dotted black line) to near zero, communicating to the public that short-term interest rates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time, and buying large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt and agency-issued mortgage-backed securities.15  These actions contributed to highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby helping to bring about a considerable improvement in labor market conditions over time. The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now 5.1 percent, slightly above the median of FOMC participants’ current estimates of its longer-run normal level. Although other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how much slack remains in the labor market, on balance the economy is no longer far away from full employment. In contrast, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s objective over the past several years, and over the past 12 months it has been essentially zero. Nevertheless, the Committee expects that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the next two or three years. I will now turn to the determinants of inflation and the factors that underlie this expectation.                                                 14  Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), among others, have recently suggested that central banks should consider raising their inflation targets, on the grounds that conditions since the financial crisis have demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates than was originally estimated. Ball (2013), for example, has proposed 4 percent as a more appropriate target for the FOMC. While it is certainly true that earlier analyses of ELB costs significantly underestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of the sort recently experienced in the United States and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that these analyses did not take into account central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional tools to mitigate the costs arising from the ELB constraint. In addition, it is not obvious that a modestly higher target rate of inflation would have greatly increased the Federal Reserve’s ability to support real activity in the special conditions that prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis, when some of the channels through which lower interest rates stimulate aggregate spending, such as housing construction, were probably attenuated. Beyond these tactical considerations, however, changing the FOMC’s long-run inflation objective would risk calling into question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level because it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future. If so, then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations discussed below – an increased ability of monetary policy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability – might be lost. Moreover, if the purpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central banks to deal with the severe recessions that follow financial crises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous supervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events. Finally, targeting inflation in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would stretch the meaning of “stable prices” in the Federal Reserve Act. 15  For a more complete listing of the Federal Reserve’s policy actions in recent years, see “The Federal Reserve’s Response to the Financial Crisis and Action to Foster Maximum Employment and Price Stability,” a webpage available on the Board’s website. Also see Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for an analysis of the combined macroeconomic effects of the FOMC’s asset purchases and guidance concerning the future path of the federal funds rate. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Inflation dynamics Models used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between changes in food and energy prices – which enter into total inflation – and movements in the prices of other goods and services – that is, core inflation. This decomposition is useful because food and energy prices can be extremely volatile, with fluctuations that often depend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy, such as technological or political developments (in the case of energy prices) or weather or disease (in the case of food prices). As a result, core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total inflation of where total inflation is headed in the medium term.16 Of course, food and energy account for a significant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective is defined in terms of the overall change in consumer prices. What, then, determines core inflation? Recalling figure 1, core inflation tends to fluctuate around a longer-term trend that now is essentially stable. Let me first focus on these fluctuations before turning to the trend. Economic theory suggests, and empirical analysis confirms, that such deviations of inflation from trend depend partly on the intensity of resource utilization in the economy – as approximated, for example, by the gap between the actual unemployment rate and its so-called natural rate, or by the shortfall of actual gross domestic product (GDP) from potential output. This relationship – which likely reflects, among other things, a tendency for firms’ costs to rise as utilization rates increase – represents an important channel through which monetary policy influences inflation over the medium term, although in practice the influence is modest and gradual. Movements in certain types of input costs, particularly changes in the price of imported goods, also can cause core inflation to deviate noticeably from its trend, sometimes by a marked amount from year to year.17 Finally, a nontrivial fraction of the quarter-to-quarter, and even the year-to-year, variability of inflation is attributable to idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks.18  What about the determinants of inflation’s longer-term trend? Here, it is instructive to compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation shown earlier in figure 1 with survey measures of people’s actual expectations of long-run inflation, as is done in figure 5. Theory suggests that inflation expectations – which presumably are linked to the central bank’s inflation goal – should play an important role in actual price setting.19 Indeed, the contours of these series are strikingly similar, which suggests that the estimated trend in inflation is in fact related to households’ and firms’ long-run inflation expectations.20                                                  16  Several other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the short-term volatility of overall inflation and thereby better discern its medium-term direction. For example, one procedure removes the components of the total PCE price index with the largest or smallest price changes before computing the average price change, yielding the “trimmed mean” PCE index; another uses the median price change in a given period, rather than the mean change, to represent the overall inflation rate. In practice, simply using core inflation does about as well in predicting overall inflation over the coming year and beyond as these alternative procedures (see Detmeister, 2011, 2012). 17  Another input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy; in recent decades, however, the pass-through of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods (see Hooker, 2002; Clark and Terry, 2010). 18  Some of these idiosyncratic shocks are related to identifiable factors, such as changes in Medicare reimbursement rates or movements in the (imputed) price of holding a checking account. (Both of these factors are included in the services component of the PCE price index, but not the consumer price index (CPI).) However, not all idiosyncratic shocks can be reliably traced to specific factors, as a significant fraction represents unpredictable “noise.” 19  Most theoretical versions of the Phillips curve suggest that inflation should depend on short-run inflation expectations, but, as an empirical matter, measures of long-run expectations appear to explain the data better. 20  See Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013), who make a related point in the context of inflation forecasting. Note that the question about expected inflation in the University of Michigan Surveys of 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  To summarize, this analysis suggests that economic slack, changes in imported goods prices, and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longer-term trend that is ultimately determined by long-run inflation expectations. As some will recognize, this model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is commonly referred to as an expectations-augmented Phillips curve.21 Total inflation in turn reflects movements in core inflation, combined with changes in the prices of food and energy. An important feature of this model of inflation dynamics is that the overall effect that variations in resource utilization, import prices, and other factors will have on inflation depends crucially on whether these influences also affect long-run inflation expectations. Figure 6 illustrates this point with a stylized example of the inflation consequences of a gradual increase in the level of import prices – perhaps occurring in response to stronger real activity abroad or a fall in the exchange value of the dollar – that causes the rate of change of import prices to be elevated for a time.22 First, consider the situation shown in panel A, in which households’ and firms’ expectations of inflation are not solidly anchored, but instead adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are actually observed.23 Such conditions  – which arguably prevailed in the United States from the 1970s to the mid-1990s – could plausibly arise if the central bank has, in the past, allowed significant and persistent movements in inflation to occur. In this case, the temporary rise in the rate of change of import prices results in a permanent increase in inflation. This shift occurs because the initial increase in inflation generated by a period of rising import prices leads households and firms to revise up their expectations of future inflation. A permanent rise in inflation would also result from a sustained rise in the level of oil prices or a temporary increase in resource utilization. By contrast, suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored, perhaps because the central bank has been successful over time in keeping inflation near some specified target and has made it clear to the public that it intends to continue to do so. Then the response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import prices or any other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel B. In this case, inflation will deviate from its longer-term level only as long as import prices are rising. But once they level out, inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence of other disturbances.24  A key implication of these two examples is that the presence of well-anchored inflation expectations greatly enhances a central bank’s ability to pursue both of its objectives – namely, price stability and full employment. Because temporary shifts in the rate of change of import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on expectations, they have only a transitory effect on inflation. As a result, the central bank can “look through” such                                                                                                                                                    Consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices, so its level – as opposed to its contour – cannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the PCE price index. 21  See Tobin (1972) and Friedman (1968) for early discussions of the theory underpinning the expectations-augmented Phillips curve. Theoretical descriptions of the inflation process remain an active area of research in economics. In recent years, many economic theorists have used a so-called new-Keynesian framework – in which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form of adjustment costs or explicit nominal contracts – to model inflation dynamics (see Woodford, 2003, chapter 3, for a textbook treatment). Although these new-Keynesian inflation models can differ importantly in their specifics, they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource utilization as drivers of inflation dynamics. 22  In this exercise, we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization induced by the change in import prices, which are expressed relative to core prices. 23  An expectations-augmented Phillips curve in which expectations of inflation are assumed to eventually respond one-for-one to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist Phillips curve. 24  Qualitatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectations – including the FRB/US, EDO, and SIGMA models maintained at the Federal Reserve Board – in which the long-term behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is governed by the central bank’s (fixed) inflation objective. 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  short-run inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy, allowing it to focus on returning the economy to full employment without placing price stability at risk. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has done just that in setting monetary policy over the past decade or more. Moreover, as I will discuss shortly, these inflation dynamics are a key reason why the FOMC expects inflation to return to 2 percent over the next few years. On balance, the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well anchored at present. Figure 7 plots the two survey measures of longer-term expected inflation I presented earlier, along with a measure of longer-term inflation compensation derived as the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-indexed ones, called TIPS. Since the late 1990s, survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been quite stable; this stability has persisted in recent years despite a deep recession and concerns expressed by some observers regarding the potential inflationary effects of unconventional monetary policy. The fact that these survey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that prevailed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full employment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its pre-recession average level of about 2 percent. This conclusion is tempered somewhat by recent movements in longer-run inflation compensation, which in principle could reflect changes in investors’ expectations for long-run inflation. This measure is now noticeably lower than in the years just prior to the financial crisis.25 However, movements in inflation compensation are difficult to interpret because they can be driven by factors that are unique to financial markets – such as movements in liquidity or risk premiums – as well as by changes in expected inflation.26 Indeed, empirical work that attempts to control for these factors suggests that the long-run inflation expectations embedded in asset prices have in fact moved down relatively little over the past decade.27 Nevertheless, the decline in inflation compensation over the past year may indicate that financial market participants now see an increased risk of very low inflation persisting. Although the evidence, on balance, suggests that inflation expectations are well anchored at present, policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted. Anchored inflation expectations were not won easily or quickly: Experience suggests that it takes many years of carefully conducted monetary policy to alter what households and firms perceive to be inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore, that a persistent failure to keep inflation under control – by letting it drift either too high or too low for too long – could cause expectations to once again become unmoored.28 Given that inflation has been running below the FOMC’s                                                 25  In evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected PCE inflation, one also needs to keep in mind that TIPS are indexed to the CPI. CPI inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point higher than PCE inflation, though that differential can vary materially over time. 26  Another complication is that we do not know whose expectations “matter” for determining inflation. Inflation expectations of professional forecasters (such as those collected in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, or the Survey of Primary Dealers) or inflation expectations derived from asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but need not reflect the views of households and firms more broadly. As an empirical matter, the little information available on the longer-term inflation expectations of firms from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Business Inflation Expectations survey suggests that firms’ expectations more closely resemble expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers than the expectations of professional forecasters. Similarly, preliminary data from a New Zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts of firms are much more similar to those of households than those of professional forecasters (see Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2015). 27  D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014) examine a number of models that use TIPS yields to back out expected inflation estimates. The best-fitting models show only a small decline in longer-term inflation expectations since 2005. 28  My interpretation of the historical evidence is that long-run inflation expectations become anchored at a particular level only after a central bank succeeds in keeping actual inflation near some target level for many years. For that reason, I am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary policy that relies primarily on the central bank’s theoretical ability to influence the public’s inflation expectations directly by 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  objective for several years now, such concerns reinforce the appropriateness of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy, which remains highly accommodative by historical standards and is directed toward helping return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.29  Before turning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook and monetary policy, a cautionary note is in order. The Phillips-curve approach to forecasting inflation has a long history in economics, and it has usefully informed monetary policy decisionmaking around the globe. But the theoretical underpinnings of the model are still a subject of controversy among economists. Moreover, inflation sometimes moves in ways that empirical versions of the model, which necessarily are a simplified version of a complicated reality, cannot adequately explain. For this reason, significant uncertainty attaches to Phillips curve predictions, and the validity of forecasts from this model must be continuously evaluated in response to incoming data. Policy implications Assuming that my reading of the data is correct and long-run inflation expectations are in fact anchored near their pre-recession levels, what implications does the preceding description of inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for monetary policy? This framework suggests, first, that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove transitory. As the solid black line in figure 8 indicates, PCE inflation has run noticeably below our 2 percent objective on average since 2008, with the shortfall approaching about 1 percentage point in both 2013 and 2014 and more than 1–1/2 percentage points this year. The stacked bars in the figure give the contributions of various factors to these deviations from 2 percent, computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation model I just discussed.30 As the solid blue portion of the bars shows, falling consumer energy prices explain about half of this                                                                                                                                                    simply announcing that it will pursue a different inflation goal in the future. Although such announcements might potentially persuade some financial market participants and professional forecasters to shift their expectations, other members of the public are probably much less likely to do so. Hence, actual inflation would probably be affected only after the central bank has had sufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained commitment and ability to generate a new norm for the average level of inflation and the behavior of monetary policy – a process that might take years, based on U.S. experience. Consistent with my assessment that announcements alone are not enough, Bernanke and others (1999) found no evidence across a number of countries that the initial disinflation which follows the adoption of inflation targeting is any less costly than disinflations carried out under alternative monetary regimes. 29  Some might be surprised that the preceding discussion of inflation determinants makes no mention of labor costs. In the past, wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation; indeed, the presence of a so-called wage-price spiral – in which higher price inflation led workers to push for higher wage growth, thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms’ labor costs accelerated – was often invoked to explain the inflationary dynamics of the 1970s. The wage-price spiral no longer seems to provide a useful description of the U.S. inflation process. In fact, some evidence suggests that, like inflation, the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable long-run trend; again, a likely explanation for this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. (See Peneva and Rudd, 2015, for some suggestive evidence along these lines.) More generally, movements in labor costs no longer appear to be an especially good guide to future price movements. (This development does not imply that wage developments carry no useful information: Because wage growth is influenced by labor market slack, observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of how close the economy is to full employment.) 30  For a technical explanation of the procedure used to produce this decomposition, see the appendix. In the decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a result, the contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change relative to the core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending. (Note that the “other” category includes the effects of changes in food prices.) The estimated contribution of movements in import prices is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation, they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 2 percent. In addition, the decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization and other factors. 
   10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  year’s shortfall and a sizable portion of the 2013 and 2014 shortfalls as well. Another important source of downward pressure this year has been a decline in import prices, the portion with orange checkerboard pattern, which is largely attributable to the 15 percent appreciation in the dollar’s exchange value over the past year. In contrast, the restraint imposed by economic slack, the green dotted portion, has diminished steadily over time as the economy has recovered and is now estimated to be relatively modest.31 Finally, a similarly small portion of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent is explained by other factors (which include changes in food prices); importantly, the effects of these other factors are transitory and often switch sign from year to year. Although an accounting exercise like this one is always imprecise and will depend on the specific model that is used, I think its basic message – that the current near-zero rate of inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary effects of falling prices for energy and non-energy imports – is quite plausible. If so, the 12-month change in total PCE prices is likely to rebound to 1-1/2 percent or higher in 2016, barring a further substantial drop in crude oil prices and provided that the dollar does not appreciate noticeably further. To be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid economic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation expectations remaining near their pre-recession level. Fortunately, prospects for the U.S. economy generally appear solid. Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 210,000 since the start of the year and the overall economy has been expanding modestly faster than its productive potential. My colleagues and I, based on our most recent forecasts, anticipate that this pattern will continue and that labor market conditions will improve further as we head into 2016. The labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years. Even so, further improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we are probably not yet all the way back to full employment. Although the unemployment rate may now be close to its longer-run normal level – which most FOMC participants now estimate is around 4.9 percent – this traditional metric of resource utilization almost certainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently exists: On a cyclically adjusted basis, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying trend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer full-time employment.32 Consistent with this assessment is the slow pace at which hourly wages and compensation have been rising, which suggests that most firms still find it relatively easy to hire and retain employees. Reducing slack along these other dimensions may involve a temporary decline in the unemployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent, in the longer run, with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent. For example, attracting discouraged workers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful employment opportunities and strong hiring. Similarly, firms may be unwilling to restructure their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater difficulty filling part-time positions. Beyond these considerations, a modest decline in the unemployment rate below its long-run level for a time would, by increasing resource utilization, also have the benefit of speeding the return to 2 percent inflation. Finally, albeit more speculatively, such an environment might help reverse                                                 31  As discussed later, the current difference between the unemployment rate and its normal longer-run level likely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market. If so, the estimates reported in figure 8 somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent and, correspondingly, overstate the contribution from other factors. For example, if the standard unemployment gap currently understates the true level of slack by 1/2 percentage point, then the contribution of slack to this year’s inflation shortfall is roughly 0.1 percentage point larger than the estimate reported in figure 8. 32  For a further discussion of the current level of resource utilization, see the Federal Reserve Board’s most recent Monetary Policy Report, dated July 15, 2015. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  some of the significant supply-side damage that appears to have occurred in recent years, thereby improving Americans’ standard of living.33 Consistent with the inflation framework I have outlined, the medians of the projections provided by FOMC participants at our recent meeting show inflation gradually moving back to 2 percent, accompanied by a temporary decline in unemployment slightly below the median estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the longer run. These projections embody two key judgments regarding the projected relationship between real activity and interest rates. First, the real federal funds rate is currently somewhat below the level that would be consistent with real GDP expanding in line with potential, which implies that the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall in the absence of some tightening. Second, participants implicitly expect that the various headwinds to economic growth that I mentioned earlier will continue to fade, thereby boosting the economy’s underlying strength. Combined, these two judgments imply that the real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full employment in the medium run should rise gradually over time. This expectation, coupled with inherent lags in the response of real activity and inflation to changes in monetary policy, are the key reasons that most of my colleagues and I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue boosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further and inflation moves back to our 2 percent objective. By itself, the precise timing of the first increase in our target for the federal funds rate should have only minor implications for financial conditions and the general economy. What matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of short-term interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public. As I noted, most of my colleagues and I anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant raising short-term interest rates at a quite gradual pace over the next few years. It’s important to emphasize, however, that both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent adjustments to our federal funds rate target will depend on how developments in the economy influence the Committee’s outlook for progress toward maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. The economic outlook, of course, is highly uncertain and it is conceivable, for example, that inflation could remain appreciably below our 2 percent target despite the apparent anchoring of inflation expectations. Here, Japan’s recent history may be instructive: As shown in figure 9, survey measures of longer-term expected inflation in that country remained positive and stable even as that country experienced many years of persistent, mild deflation.34 The explanation for the persistent divergence between actual and expected inflation in Japan is not clear, but I believe that it illustrates a problem faced by all central banks: Economists’ understanding of the dynamics of inflation is far from perfect. Reflecting that limited understanding, the predictions of our models often err, sometimes significantly so. Accordingly, inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than the Committee currently anticipates; should such a development occur, we would need to adjust the stance of policy in response. Considerable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity. For example, we cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the domestic economy will continue to fade. Moreover, net exports have served as a significant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial developments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain U.S. economic activity somewhat further. The Committee is monitoring developments abroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the                                                 33  For a discussion of the supply-side damage that has occurred since 2007 and the potential benefits of partially reversing it through more accommodative monetary policy, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015) and Van Zandweghe (forthcoming). 34  In addition, we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the Federal Reserve were to permit actual inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has substantially recovered. 
   12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy. That said, in response to surprises affecting the outlook for economic activity, as with those affecting inflation, the FOMC would need to adjust the stance of policy so that our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over the medium term in the context of maximum employment. Given the highly uncertain nature of the outlook, one might ask: Why not hold off raising the federal funds rate until the economy has reached full employment and inflation is actually back at 2 percent? The difficulty with this strategy is that monetary policy affects real activity and inflation with a substantial lag. If the FOMC were to delay the start of the policy normalization process for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. In addition, continuing to hold short-term interest rates near zero well after real activity has returned to normal and headwinds have faded could encourage excessive leverage and other forms of inappropriate risk-taking that might undermine financial stability. For these reasons, the more prudent strategy is to begin tightening in a timely fashion and at a gradual pace, adjusting policy as needed in light of incoming data. Conclusion To conclude, let me emphasize that, following the dual mandate established by the Congress, the Federal Reserve is committed to the achievement of maximum employment and price stability. To this end, we have maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy since the financial crisis; that policy has fostered a marked improvement in labor market conditions and helped check undesirable disinflationary pressures. However, we have not yet fully attained our objectives under the dual mandate: Some slack remains in labor markets, and the effects of this slack and the influence of lower energy prices and past dollar appreciation have been significant factors keeping inflation below our goal. But I expect that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on inflation wane, provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete the return to maximum employment and long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored. Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter. But if the economy surprises us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change. References Ascari, Guido, and Argia M.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 15  Appendix: The estimated inflation model and inflation decomposition procedure The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations – an identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and a simple reduced-form forecasting equation for core PCE inflation. The identity is  where  and  denote growth rates (expressed as annualized log differences) of total and core PCE prices, respectively;  and  are annualized growth rates for prices of consumer energy goods and services and prices of food and beverages, both expressed relative to core PCE prices; and  and  are the weights of energy and food in total consumption. The core inflation forecasting equation is  where  is expected long-run inflation;  denotes the level of resource utilization;  controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods;  is a white-noise error term; and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates obtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4. For estimation purposes, is approximated using the unemployment rate less the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural rate, while is proxied using the median forecasts of long-run PCE or CPI inflation reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, with a constant adjustment of 50 basis points prior to 2007 to put the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis. (Prior to 1991:Q4, this series is based on the long-run inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.) The relative import price term, , is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price index for core imported goods, less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied by the share of nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP. To decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the series used in the inflation model – for which data are available only through 2015:Q2 in most cases – are first extended through the end of 2015. In the case of inflation, the extensions are consistent with the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation in 2015 that were reported at the press conference following the September FOMC meeting.35 Similarly, over the second half of 2015 is defined to be consistent with the median of FOMC projections for the 2015:Q4 unemployment rate, less the CBO’s estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate; the CBO’s 2015 estimate is almost identical to the median of FOMC participants’ most recent projections of the normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate. For changes in the prices of consumer energy and core imports, the 2015:H2 extrapolations are based on regressions of these two series on current and lagged changes in, respectively, crude oil prices and exchange rates. This approach predicts that energy prices should decline at annual rates of about 6 percent in 2015:Q3 and 18 percent in 2015:Q4, while core import prices should fall about 2–1/2 percent at an annual rate in both                                                 35  For the information on participants’ forecasts provided at the September 17, 2015 press conference, see http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150917.pdf.

Food prices are assumed to remain flat at their 2015:Q2 level; this assumption ensures that the combined contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2015 is consistent with the median difference between FOMC participants’ projections for total and core inflation. Finally, nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports are assumed to remain unchanged at their 2015:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation expectations are assumed to remain constant at 2 percent. After computing historical  tracking errors for the two equations of the model, the final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counter-factual simulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2015:Q4. One by one, each explanatory variable of the model is set to zero and the model is simulated; the resulting difference between actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that particular factor. Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation term in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding period, rather than its actual value. As a result, the decompositions incorporate the effects of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the explanatory variables.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Remarks at the FIBI Annual Lunch Speech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Federation of International Banks in Ireland (FIBI), Dublin, 23 September 2015. *      *      * In recent years the global economy has witnessed a set of economic and financial conditions that were considered barely possible in the years of the “Great Moderation”. Interest rates across advanced economies have fallen to very low levels. In the euro area we have even seen negative yields out along the yield curve: at one point in April 2015 up to about 36% of euro-denominated government bonds were in negative territory. And inflation in most advanced economies has remained subdued: in our case it has followed a prolonged downward drift since late 2011 and still remains stubbornly low. What I would like to explain in my remarks is how we arrived at this situation, and how we can return to a situation that, looking retrospectively, would be considered “more normal”. My main message is that the euro area is still going through the correction phase of a pronounced financial cycle, and while monetary policy has a vital to role to play in supporting demand through that transition, it must be complemented by other policies to achieve a strong and sustained recovery from the crisis. The causes of the current situation The low growth and low interest rate environment we see in the euro area today is in part a secular phenomenon. The growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) has been slowing in the euro area for decades. Population growth has also declined from about 0.7% in the early 1970s to around 0.3% in recent years. This has been mirrored in the long-term decline of real interest rates, as lower TFP and population growth implies lower demand for investment and for loanable funds. But secular trends do not explain fully the current situation. Cyclical forces also lead to fluctuations around secular trends, especially when driven by the financial cycle, and such forces are still at play in the euro area today. Demand conditions, while improving, appear relatively weak for the early stage of the business cycle. This is largely explained by the legacy of the financial crisis. Specifically, the euro area is coming out of a “balance sheet recession”, where a build-up of excessive debt set the conditions for a sharp downturn, which in turn created the need for substantial deleveraging and balance sheet repair, prolonging the length of the slump. The fact that financial excesses were associated with significant sectoral resource misallocation, especially into construction, further hindered the pace of recovery. The duration of the downturn has also itself exacerbated the damage to output. Long-term unemployment has risen, with “hysteresis” effects estimated to have reduced potential growth. This in turn appears to have induced some negative sentiment about long-term growth: for example, businesses currently perceive themselves to have limited excess capacity, despite a large estimated output gap. Such uncertainty feeds back into weaker demand today through expectations and confidence channels. Investment, while gradually picking up, still remains well below pre-crisis levels. Such post-debt crisis effects have, to some extent, been common among advanced economies that were strongly hit by the global financial crisis. Yet most observers would agree that the costs have been especially high for the euro area. This is due to a third factor particular to the euro area: an incomplete institutional construction, which has made working through the aftermath of the financial cycle harder. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Crucially, the euro area lacked a truly integrated banking system that could share risk across countries not just in good times, but also in bad times. Without a harmonised, effective and predictable resolution framework to involve the private sector, and a European public backstop to preserve financial stability, the onus fell onto sovereigns to support their national banking sectors. And as banks in some of the most vulnerable countries remained heavily exposed to their sovereigns, this fed back into systemic banking crises in certain jurisdictions via the “diabolical loop” between banks and sovereigns. Other institutional mechanisms that could have cushioned the shock also turned out to be weak. Notably, mechanisms to accelerate balance sheet restructuring while minimising its fallout on the economy were inoperative due to shortcomings in the legal frameworks in many countries. Weak national insolvency regimes and slow judicial systems reduced the scope for debt re-absorption through write-offs and resolution of bad loans in the euro area, especially compared with other post-crisis experiences. The upshot has been a slower and more painful deleveraging. To sum up, though secular forces are certainly at play in the euro area, the current situation is also explained by cyclical factors linked to the financial cycle, which have in turn been exacerbated by institutional failings. A strong and sustained recovery therefore depends on a comprehensive response that addresses each of these policy challenges. That is now underway. The response of monetary policy On the cyclical side, monetary policy has played, and will continue to play, an important role in responding to demand weakness and the disinflationary pressures it creates. But with fiscal policy largely unavailable due to fragile public finances, this has required a determined monetary policy stance. Implementing that stance has increasingly implied unconventional measures as short-term interest rates run into the effective lower bound. We have also had to design our policy to address serious disruptions in monetary transmission caused by the financial fragmentation of the euro area. The unconventional measures we have adopted include, most recently, the Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations and our expanded Asset Purchase Programme. These measures support demand through several transmission channels, but crucially they have helped unclog the bank lending channel of monetary policy, thereby producing a virtuous circle between credit supply and demand which lends momentum to the recovery. In particular, the incentives embedded in the TLTRO have led banks to compete more for credit to support growth, by cutting margins and lending rates. Lower rates have in turn created higher net demand for borrowing, allowing banks to expand their overall lending volumes and keep interest income on a rising path. This has then initiated a gradual easing of credit standards, further strengthening competitive pressures. And at the macroeconomic level, this virtuous circle leads to an improvement in the outlook for economic growth that helps to contain non-performing loans. Through meeting its mandate in this way, monetary policy has also supported an orderly deleveraging. Accommodative policy reduces interest payment burdens while raising nominal growth. Yet monetary policy alone cannot solve a debt overhang. That requires a mix of higher real growth rates and lower nominal debt. In both areas, the institutional incompleteness of the euro area has hindered the process of balance sheet adjustment. But in both, substantial progress is now being made. This is where the efforts to tackle secular and institutional challenges come in. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The role of other policies To begin with, many countries have been implementing structural reforms to lift potential output and temper secular drags on growth. Particularly important here are policies that help reverse resource misallocation and thereby increase employment and TFP. Such policies include product market reforms that strengthen competitive pressures and encourage the reallocation of capital towards the most productive firms; and labour market reforms, especially active labour market policies, that help provide workers with the skills they need to move to more innovative sectors. Successful examples of such measures have been introduced in Spain, Ireland and other reforming countries. The process of private sector debt workout is also advancing. The ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment has accelerated the crucial step of acknowledging and provisioning for NPLs. What is now key is that, where necessary, those NPLs are further restructured through more efficient insolvency proceedings or removed from banks’ balance sheets altogether. Several countries have taken national initiatives to improve in- and out-of-court restructuring frameworks and establish asset management companies for NPLs. This could be supported at the European level by progressing with Capital Markets Union, which should induce greater legal convergence and deepen markets for distressed debt. Supporting the deleveraging process in these ways – by raising real growth and working out private debt – would provide further momentum to the recovery, while raising confidence in long-term growth prospects. But importantly, balance sheet repair also creates the pre-conditions to address definitively one of the euro area’s key institutional weaknesses: the incomplete Banking Union. A great deal of progress has been made in this area in recent years. With the Single Supervisory Mechanism we now have a system of supervision that is less liable to capture or forbearance. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive provides a harmonised and predictable framework for private sector risk-sharing across the Union. And governments are on the way to establishing a European public backstop for the Single Resolution Mechanism. But if we are to complete Banking Union – notably in terms the backstop to the SRM and establishing a common deposit guarantee scheme – legacy assets need first to be fully addressed. That is why balance sheet repair is pivotal. Completing Banking Union also requires removing any remnants of the regulatory framework that implicitly support home bias. For example, how much national discretion is allowed in implementing rules; how fungible are liquidity and capital across borders; how regulations, such as those on loss-absorbing capital, affect the choice of subsidiaries versus branches – all these decisions will crucially shape the microeconomic incentives of banks to become European. And the macroeconomic consequences for the Union are significant. Conclusion To conclude, working through the aftermath of a financial cycle requires a comprehensive response. Monetary policy will play its part for as long as needed, which means the full implementation of the asset purchase programme and, if necessary, adjustments to its size, composition and duration. And by meeting our objective, we support growth and inflation, which in turn creates the conditions for interest rates to “normalise” once more. But monetary policy can only do so much. It is for other policymakers to address the secular and institutional factors that are preventing a stronger and more sustained recovery. Efforts are now well underway. But longer they take, the higher the hurdles that all policymakers will ultimately have to climb. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Daniel K Tarullo: Capital regulation across financial intermediaries Speech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Bank of France Conference “Financial Regulation – Stability versus Uniformity; A Focus on Non-bank Actors”, Paris, 28 September 2015. *      *      * Strengthening the quantity and quality of capital held by banks has been a central element of post-financial crisis regulatory reform. Yet, as the topic of this conference reminds us, the crisis also exposed weaknesses in other financial intermediaries that carried systemic implications. In the United States, when Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed, they were so-called freestanding investment banks, not subject even to the inadequate pre-crisis regulatory regime for bank holding companies. The stress at American International Group (AIG), an insurance company, and the vulnerability of money market funds to destabilizing runs contributed to a profound deepening of the crisis. Hence the theme for this session of the conference: In light of this recent history and, more generally, of the steady growth of nonbank financial intermediaries, to what degree should they be subject to the capital regulations developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and applied to bank holding companies in the United States and to all commercial and investment banks in Europe? At first glance, the answer to this question might seem intuitively obvious. After all, the risk of loss associated with a particular corporate loan or mortgage-backed security or, indeed, any other asset does not vary just because its legal owner is an insurance company or mutual fund, rather than a bank. Yet we all know that regulatory capital requirements sometimes do vary with the nature of the firm. And I suspect that most people in this room believe there are good reasons why they should vary under at least some circumstances. In my remarks this morning, I will explain how the identification of those circumstances should proceed – by looking not at the asset side of a financial intermediary’s balance sheet, but at the liability side. The scope and nature of a firm’s liabilities provide the justifications for capital requirements regulation. Differences in liabilities can, accordingly, sometimes warrant different capital requirements for portfolios of similar assets across firms. At the risk of packing too much into these introductory points, let me also note that an emphasis on a firm’s liabilities is related to, but not synonymous with, an emphasis on its activities. Thus, for example, simply deciding that an intermediary provides mostly commercial banking services or insurance products does not fully answer the question of what its capital requirements should be. My purpose today is not to offer specific proposals, or even a comprehensive conceptual framework, but instead to propose an approach for thinking about the purposes of capital regulation across types of financial intermediaries that will suggest appropriate starting points for shaping – or reshaping – applicable capital regulation. This seems to me a particularly important effort at a time when the financial system is undergoing significant change. Liability structure and capital regulation To begin, we should remind ourselves that capital regulation of private corporations is unusual. Generally, market actors with actual or contemplated claims on a nonfinancial corporation are left to their own devices in protecting their interests, though various features of contract, securities, and insolvency law are designed to help them make these judgments more efficiently. In many kinds of financial intermediaries, on the other hand, capital levels are regulated, usually because of market failures attributable to some combination of information problems, moral hazard, collective action problems, and systemic risk. Scrutiny of the liability side of the balance sheet reveals whether and how these various justifications 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  are present for different financial intermediaries. Let me start with a couple of straightforward examples, well-established in regulatory practice. The first example arises from the fact that, by the very nature of their business, many intermediaries have substantially more customer-facing liabilities1 on their balance sheets than nonfinancial firms. This characteristic often means that leverage is higher. It almost always means that a large portion of the liability side of the balance sheet is accounted for by such customers, who are not well-positioned to evaluate the soundness of these intermediaries’ often-opaque balance sheets. Consider the case of a very traditional life insurance company, which collects premiums from customers over a protracted period of time, while promising a payout to beneficiaries if the insured dies within the coverage period. The duration of the exposure, difficulties in evaluating the company’s ability to pay, and the potentially high costs of changing coverage to another firm even if that evaluation can be done together provide a rationale for insurance company capital requirements. Here the motivation for capital regulation is likely oriented toward the capacity of the company to meet these long-term claims as they come due, presumably over a fairly extended span. Investors and counterparties from the financial sector might well be left to fend for themselves. Thus this rationale for capital regulation focuses only on assuring sufficient assets over time to satisfy the policyholders’ claims should the company fail, with less attention to maintaining the company as a going concern. A second example of how the liability side of an intermediary’s balance sheet suggests the appropriate form of capital regulation is presented by the familiar problem of deposit runs on banks. Like a policyholder, a depositor has difficulty gauging the health of the financial intermediary. But unlike a life insurance policyholder, a depositor can withdraw all or most of her funds if she has any fear – even an ill-founded fear – that the bank may be in trouble. Indeed, depositors have a rational incentive to act quickly, since the first to withdraw will have the best chance of getting all their money back. Experience with bank runs, and with the more-damaging cases of bank panics (in which problems at one bank are imputed to others on the basis of incomplete and possibly incorrect information), led to government-provided deposit insurance. While countering runs and panics and protecting depositors from loss, government deposit insurance creates different justifications for capital regulation – protecting the government insurance fund, which is now guaranteeing a significant portion of the bank’s liabilities, and countering moral hazard, which may arise because insured depositors need no longer care whether the bank is adequately capitalized. The moral hazard issue leads us to a third example of how the liability side of the balance sheet of a financial intermediary reveals the need for capital regulation – the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. As the size of an intermediary increases, its exposures to other market actors – including many other intermediaries – may become so extensive that its failure would threaten the financial system as a whole. Believing that the government will, for this reason, prevent such an intermediary from becoming insolvent, market actors may extend credit as if a guarantee similar to deposit insurance were in place. Thus the nature and extent of the firm’s liabilities, taken as a whole, may warrant capital regulation to offset an implicit TBTF subsidy. Even if the distinct problem of TBTF could be countered through other means, such as a credible bankruptcy or resolution option, the failure of a financial intermediary with systemically significant liabilities raises the prospect of imposing very large negative externalities on the financial system. This prospect creates an additional argument for capital                                                 1  By “customer facing liabilities,” I mean liabilities to households, retail investors, and businesses. In financial intermediaries, these liabilities are not only greater than in similarly sized balance sheets of non-financial firms. They also disproportionately arise from financial transactions – such as accepting deposits or investments – rather than for performance of services or delivery of goods. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  requirements – or, more precisely, an argument for progressively higher capital requirements that would reduce the probability of the failure of the systemically important intermediary. Note that this last discussion has moved us toward consideration of macroprudential reasons for capital requirements – specifically, for higher requirements aimed at reducing the probability of insolvency below that which would be warranted if the sole regulatory aim were to protect customers, depositors, or even a government deposit insurance fund. As has been much discussed in recent years, pre-crisis financial regulatory regimes had substantially undervalued systemwide considerations. Indeed, in the first instance the crisis spread not only because of the direct effects engendered by the insolvency of individual firms, but also because of the dramatic contraction of funding available throughout markets for widely held assets such as mortgage-backed securities. The pre-crisis explosion of short-term wholesale funding, both inside and outside traditional banks, left the entire financial system vulnerable to the disappearance of this market funding as real estate prices declined sharply and uncertainty spread about the value of the assets being funded. Concerns about solvency accelerated the run of wholesale funding from Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, raising the prospect of classic fire sales of their assets, with consequent depressing effects on the balance sheets of all firms holding these assets. Experience during the financial crisis vindicated the view of those who had argued that liquidity, as well as capital, in large intermediaries needed to be regulated.2 It also buttressed the view that capital and liquidity regulation are closely related and need to be developed in tandem, if not as part of the same regulatory framework. Much academic research prompted by the crisis has focused on the interrelationship between funding and solvency problems.3 Here, then, is another way in which the characteristics of the liability side of an intermediary’s balance sheet should determine the form and stringency of capital regulation. Shorter duration and, if you will, increased “runnability” of its liabilities create greater threats to both its stability and that of the financial system as a whole. Where a firm is significantly dependent on this kind of funding, it may need more common equity to convince counterparties and investors of its solvency during periods in which assets are very volatile and to maintain its solvency should it need to sell assets at fire sale prices. This microprudential basis for higher capital requirements is complemented by the macroprudential rationale that intermediaries whose deleveraging could have a broad impact on market liquidity through fire sale or related effects should be required to hold still more capital. Let me make three additional points on this rationale for higher capital standards. First, a run that cuts off funding to widely held assets is a greater risk to the system than a conventional bank run in the absence of deposit insurance. A bank’s whole loans would not usually be sold in great number even under stressed circumstances and, even to the degree they were, other banks’ portfolios of loans are generally not marked down because of the stressed bank’s sales. Second, the possible availability of central bank liquidity support does not obviate the need for higher capital for intermediaries reliant on short-term wholesale funding. The same factors that make market actors uncertain about the value of the intermediary’s assets in times of stress will be relevant to the central bank’s ability to assure itself that the recipient of temporary liquidity is in fact solvent. Third, because these risks to the firm and                                                 2  For a highly insightful survey of the implications of illiquidity issues for market performance and regulation, see Jean Tirole (2011), “Illiquidity and All Its Friends,” Journal of Economic Literature vol. 49, no. 2, pp. 287–325. 3  See, e.g., Markus Brunnermeier and Lasse Heje Pedersen (2009), “Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity,” Review of Financial Studies, vol. 22, no. 6, pp. 2201–2238; Viral Acharya and S.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the financial system arise from of the composition of the liability side of the balance sheet, the concerns expressed here apply – though perhaps in somewhat different degrees – regardless of the particular form of intermediation in which the firm is engaged. Tailoring capital regulation With only modest simplification of the always complex world of financial regulation, one can say that while capital requirements traditionally have differed significantly for different types of financial intermediaries, they have been relatively uniform for all firms classified as a particular type of intermediary. As I mentioned at the outset, the variations in capital requirements might run contrary to the intuition that the risk of loss of a given portfolio of assets is the same no matter who owns them. Of course, the direct explanation for the variations lies in part in institutional history, with different regulatory bodies having been given authority over different types of financial intermediaries. Still, as we have seen, differences in the liability side of the balance sheet can in fact provide a good policy justification for having varying capital requirements among different types of financial intermediaries. Yet, as I will suggest in a moment, even if conventional differences are at least broadly justifiable (which, of course, is not to say that certain differences in any particular jurisdiction have been well-formulated in all their specifics), the fact that so many intermediaries have moved well beyond their traditional practices, products, and scope may warrant some qualification of conventional practice. Conversely, the conventional regulatory principle of imposing more or less uniform capital requirements on a given form of intermediary might have seemed intuitively correct. But one lesson regulators around the world have drawn from the crisis is that macroprudential considerations can sometimes argue for varying capital requirements among the same kind of intermediaries. Let me address, then, some implications of the liability-side perspective on capital requirements for different forms of financial intermediaries. Despite the focus of this session of the conference on nonbanks, I want to begin by noting how post-crisis changes in the Basel regime reflected the characteristics of an intermediary’s liabilities. Prior to the crisis, the Basel regime – though nominally applicable only to internationally active banks – in fact applied to most banks in many member jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union (EU). There were no quantitative liquidity requirements, and capital requirements did not vary based on the liability side of the balance sheet. Indeed, the major departure from uniform application of capital rules was the opportunity afforded by Basel II for large banks to use their own internal models in determining their regulatory capital requirements, an opportunity that Basel II’s proponents expected to result in slightly lower requirements than under a standardized approach. In the wake of the crisis, Basel III strengthened capital quality and levels across the board. In addition, capital surcharges were imposed on about thirty banks of global systemic importance (G-SIBs), based on criteria that roughly reflect TBTF concerns – that is, the size and interconnectedness of the firms’ balance sheets. Neither the generally applicable Basel III changes nor the G-SIB surcharges were specifically tied to the stability of a bank’s debt structure. However, minimum quantitative liquidity requirements have been developed in the form of the shorter-horizon Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the longer-horizon Net Stable Funding Ratio, which together are intended to place some limits on excessive reliance on runnable liabilities.4                                                 4  In the United States, we have also applied a somewhat less stringent version of the LCR to banks that are large but that do not cross the threshold of being internationally active. This tiered approach is consistent with the principle stated earlier that prudential requirements should vary based on the potential impact of a firm’s failure on the financial system as a whole. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Important as these changes have been, the risks to the financial system posed by large amounts of short-term wholesale funding argue for closer regulatory linkage between capital and liquidity concerns. Conceptually, the cleanest approach might be to integrate capital and liquidity requirements in a single regulatory framework, which would establish minimum levels of capital and liquidity and then increase the capital requirement for intermediaries with more vulnerable funding structures. Higher capital levels would be especially warranted for intermediaries using large enough amounts of short-term debt that their response when funding liquidity is constrained – either selling assets or withholding funding from their own customers – could adversely affect the financial system as a whole. Realistically, though, the goal of full integration of capital and liquidity regulation seems unattainable for the foreseeable future. For one thing, it is hard to imagine all the relevant banking, market, and insurance regulators converging on such a novel approach anytime soon. In addition, though, without a more complete understanding of the precise relationship between liquidity and capital needs, placing so much weight on one form of regulation would be ill-advised. For the present, then, the Basel regime will maintain separate capital and liquidity regulations, which may differ among types of financial intermediaries.5 But we can at least strive to establish each set of regulations with reference to the other and to attain at least a rough consistency across regulatory regimes applicable to various intermediaries. In the United States, we have already taken one step in this direction. As you may know, in implementing the Basel G-SIB capital surcharge, we decided that surcharges somewhat higher than those finally agreed in Basel were appropriate. As we refashioned the Basel approach, we added a metric on short-term wholesale funding dependence to the formula for determining a firm’s systemic significance, a factor that unfortunately had not been included in Basel. I hope that when it comes time for a review of the Basel methodology for identifying and grouping G-SIBs, funding practices and vulnerabilities will receive more attention. And there may be further steps that could increase that sensitivity. Exploring ideas along these lines seems to me far preferable to raising minimum liquidity requirements for all banks, even those with capital levels well above the regulatory minimum. For example, while stress testing has traditionally focused on risks to capital, some observers have suggested adding liquidity risks to the stress test. Turning now to some implications for other intermediaries, I will begin with broker-dealers, which pose perhaps the clearest case of the capital/funding relationship. Broker-dealers tend to hold large amounts of assets that are of longer duration, but that also are relatively liquid in normal times (in contrast, say, to whole loans by a bank). However, as seen most graphically in the case of mortgage-backed securities during the crisis, many of these assets can rapidly become quite illiquid in periods of stress. Since broker-dealers generally fund substantial portions of these assets with short-term liabilities, such as repurchase agreements (repos) rather than insured deposits, there is the potential, again seen in the crisis, for runs reminiscent of the bank runs of the era before the advent of deposit insurance.                                                                                                                                                     The liquidity rules clearly seem to have influenced the way banks manage their balance sheets. In the United States, bank holding companies subject to the LCR significantly increased their holdings of high-quality liquid assets from the beginning of 2013 until the beginning of this year, to the point that many internationally active banks reported their LCR ratios already above fully phased-in requirements, even though the transition rules set an 80 percent minimum ratio for January 1, 2015. 5  It is worth noting that the net capital rule for broker-dealers maintained by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a form of hybrid capital and liquidity regulation. However, it seems basically oriented to protecting customers, a bit like traditional regulation of life insurance companies, and was not developed with going concern or systemic implications in mind. It does not, for instance, place higher requirements on firms with heavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding, though it does penalize firms that hold large amounts of illiquid assets. In many respects the rule seems well-suited to smaller broker-dealers but, for reasons explained earlier, it does not seem optimal for the large broker-dealers in large bank holding companies. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  To a considerable extent, of course, the Basel framework covers these firms. In the EU, any broker-dealer is covered, whether as a stand-alone entity or as part of a universal bank. In the pre-crisis period in the United States, matters were less clear, since only broker-dealers affiliated with bank holding companies were covered by the full panoply of Basel requirements. There was partial coverage of the five largest freestanding broker-dealers that needed such oversight in order to operate within the EU. Because, during the crisis, those five firms either became bank holding companies or failed and had their continuing operations absorbed by bank holding companies, all sizeable domestically owned broker-dealers are now covered by Basel requirements. However, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the Basel framework itself has not gone as far as is desirable in making capital requirements at the largest institutions sensitive to macroprudential funding concerns, a circumstance underscored by the balance sheets typical of broker-dealers. Consideration of changes such as refinement of the formula for assigning surcharges to G-SIBs would be useful when Basel standards are revisited over time. In the interim, there are more near-term opportunities for supervisory measures that take account of the relationship between capital levels and funding vulnerabilities. Perhaps the most interesting application of a liability-side focus on capital regulation is the case of insurance companies. Given the ongoing discussions of capital standards in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the issue is also a timely one. Several relevant points can be derived from attention to the liability side of insurance company balance sheets. First, as shown in my earlier example of how liability structure affects capital needs, the largest segment of a traditional insurance company’s liabilities is composed of contingent claims based on the occurrence of specified events, such as the death of an insured person or destruction of insured property. These claims cannot be accelerated at the discretion of the holders of the contracts so, unlike deposits in a bank, these liabilities cannot run in any meaningful sense. Unless customers decide to sever their relationship with the company, in which case the contingent liability will be reduced or eliminated, they will continue to provide funding to the firm. Life insurance, in particular, has an unusually predictable liability pattern, well-refined by actuaries over the years. Thus there is a relative absence of liquidity risk as compared with other kinds of intermediaries. Property and casualty insurance is somewhat more volatile but that volatility is not correlated with the broader economy. So, while higher capital levels may be needed for microprudential purposes, the traditional property-casualty insurance model does not appear to raise significant funding, fire sale, or other macroprudential concerns. These traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital requirements than might be required for a hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets. And, as noted earlier, in some respects they also argue for a gone-concern approach to capital regulation. However, a second observation is that the liability side of the balance sheets of many large insurance companies look quite different from this traditional picture. Many life insurers, for example, now offer wealth and retirement products with account values that can be withdrawn at the discretion of the policyholder, sometimes with little or no surrender penalty. Although these products are generally considered medium to long-term liabilities, the option to surrender or withdraw funds creates the potential for increased claims that could strain the liquidity of the firm. Recent history suggests that the surrender rates of fixed annuities are directly related to the path of interest rate rises. In the middle part of the last decade, as interest rates rose in the United States, the surrender rate for these products increased by about 75 percent in just a few years, before dropping precipitously after the rapid decline in rates following the onset of the financial crisis. Similarly, the move of some insurance firms into securities lending, repo, over-the-counter derivatives, and other capital market activities can work significant changes in the balance sheets of those firms, creating tighter connections to the rest of the financial system. As with 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  other financial intermediaries, insurers then become subject to demands for posting additional collateral or closing out positions as unfavorable market conditions take hold. In addition, if the books of the insurance company are large enough, it then becomes a potential vehicle for transmitting distress at the company to other parts of the financial system. Thus the liability side of the balance sheets of firms that are all “insurance companies” can vary substantially, just as with firms that are called “banks” or “bank holding companies.” Yet capital regulation currently applicable to insurance companies seems not to make some of the relevant distinctions. Traditional capital regulation, with an implicit aim of protecting only conventional policyholders over time, potentially through an orderly insolvency, does not reflect the balance sheet risks I have just described. Yet more recent measures, such as Solvency II, with its heavy emphasis on current market valuation, may not take account of the fact that liability and liquidity risks for genuinely traditional life insurance products are relatively limited compared to those of many other intermediaries. In some respects, Solvency II ignores the strength of conventional insurance funding – that assets can be held for the truly long-term, through multiple business cycles – even as it focuses directly on the fluctuations in asset values that are indeed relevant to many less conventional activities. This brief review illustrates the challenges in fashioning capital requirements for large insurance companies with a mix of traditional, nontraditional, and noninsurance activities that are sometimes quite intertwined in particular business lines or subsidiaries. And, even where these activities are reasonably segregated from one another, some of the policy devices suggested for differential capital treatment may be misplaced. For example, deciding on higher capital requirements based solely on whether an activity is “nontraditional” for an insurance company can be inappropriate. A “nontraditional” activity for an insurance company could embrace everything from the massive derivatives business maintained by the pre-crisis AIG to very sedate businesses outside the financial sphere entirely. In confronting these and similar challenges, I would suggest that a focus on the actual nature of liabilities associated with a firm’s activities provides a good starting point for sound analysis. Finally, let me mention asset managers briefly. As they have garnered increasing shares of financial system assets, a trend that accelerated following the financial crisis, the question has arisen whether they too should hold capital buffers. Of course in most cases the asset manager itself does not have much of a balance sheet at all. The funds themselves are often not leveraged, in which case nearly all the liabilities are shares of the fund held by investors, the price of which varies to reflect the value of the assets purchased by the manager of the fund.6 While some commentators have suggested that liquidity challenges and consequent fire sale type behavior might develop if the structure of the fund places a premium on exiting first, these kinds of risks would support an argument less for capital buffers than for some form of prudential market regulation, such as rules on liquidity or redemptions. I would note in this regard that last week the SEC issued a proposed rulemaking that would require open-ended funds to have liquidity risk management controls in place for shareholder redemptions, including during times of stress.7 Likewise, to the degree that certain idiosyncratic risks might                                                 6  Through the use of certain kinds of derivatives, some funds acquire synthetic leverage. There are arguments for additional regulation in those cases, though again, capital requirements do not seem at first glance the optimal tool. 7  Under the proposed rules, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds would be required to implement liquidity risk management programs to address investor redemptions, including swing pricing during times of rapid redemption and calculation requirements to measure the amount of assets that could be liquidated without impacting market prices.

SEC Chairman Mary Jo White previously provided a roadmap to the development of a regulatory approach for the asset management 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  exist with respect to the decisions and operations of certain asset managers, their liability structure again suggests that some form of prudential market regulation would be better suited to address these risks. Conclusion In conclusion, let me recapitulate one set of points and add another. To recapitulate – focusing on the characteristics of the liability side of a financial intermediary’s balance sheet suggests that there are reasons to vary capital regulation across different forms of financial intermediation, but that significant shifts in the nature and scope of an intermediary’s liabilities may in turn provide reasons for varying applicable capital regulation among firms that are primarily identified as a particular type of intermediary. Conceptual, institutional, and practical impediments to developing a single framework for capital regulation are doubtlessly insuperable for the foreseeable future. But regulators with mandates covering different kinds of intermediaries, including the Federal Reserve, must keep both sides of this perspective in mind. And, hopefully, regulators with a more focused responsibility will be sensitive to the ways in which their regulated entities have departed from their original liability structure. The additional point follows from the first. When concerns are raised about regulatory arbitrage or a level playing field, they are usually in the context of a similar asset being held, or a business activity conducted, by financial firms with different regulatory structures. My discussion today would suggest that attention must be paid to the liability structure of the different firms before deciding whether the asymmetric regulatory treatment is prudent or an invitation to the propagation of new financial risks. These two points underscore the fact that the question for regulators is not really whether capital rules developed for banks should be extended to nonbank actors. The Basel standards have already evolved to take account of different forms of intermediation in the financial firms subject to those rules. The Basel framework might itself be enhanced by further differentiation of capital and liquidity requirements based on the liability structures of firms. Similarly, capital rules for intermediaries not subject to Basel rules should be shaped by similar considerations.                                                                                                                                                    industry: “Enhancing Risk Monitoring and Regulatory Safeguards for the Asset Management Industry,” speech delivered at the New York Times DealBook Opportunities for Tomorrow Conference, New York, December 11.

I. Introduction Thank you very much for inviting me as a panelist to the discussion on monetary policy at the Bruegel Annual Meeting. Recently, the directions of monetary policy among advanced economies have become increasingly divergent. Whereas the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun considering normalization of its policy interest rates, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and European Central Bank (ECB) continue their large-scale asset purchase programs. As one of the policy makers at the BOJ, I have closely monitored developments in the global economy and the monetary policies of major central banks. I would therefore like to talk today about the features of monetary easing of the two central banks (BOJ and ECB) as well as about developments regarding inflation expectations in Japan and the euro area. Let me stress that the views expressed here are entirely my own and do not necessarily represent those of the BOJ. II. Unconventional monetary policies – common features of the BOJ and ECB The monetary-easing instruments adopted by the two central banks have several features in common. They are (1) large-scale asset purchases centered on government bonds, (2) forward guidance used to indicate a future monetary-easing stance, and (3) a conditional long-term lending facility (Chart 1 and Reference Chart). Regarding the first instrument, the large-scale asset-purchase program is referred to as a “balance sheet policy.” This enables a central bank to expand the size of its balance sheet to a predetermined level and to maintain that size over a relatively long period. One of the expected results here is a portfolio rebalancing effect. This policy aims at promoting holders of government bonds to shift away from those bonds and invest in riskier assets, such as loans and corporate bonds, stocks, foreign securities, and real estate, thereby affecting a wide range of markets and energizing economic activity. Since April 2013, the BOJ has adopted an aggressive balance sheet policy by setting a target on the annual pace of the monetary base increase under quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE). The BOJ has been increasing the monetary base at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. It has also been purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace also of about 80 trillion yen. With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, JGBs with all maturities, including 40-year bonds, are eligible for the BOJ’s purchase and the average remaining maturity of government bonds to be purchased is currently targeted in the range of seven to ten years. In addition to government bonds, the BOJ makes such purchases as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs). This balance sheet policy has contributed to an expansion of corporate profits and employment together with a stock price hike and depreciation of the yen, which have helped improve the output gap by about 2 percentage points. The ECB (as well as European national central banks) has purchased euro-denominated bonds issued by euro-area governments, agencies, and European institutions since March 2015 in an effort to restore the size of its balance sheet to that of March 2012 – or about 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3 trillion euros. In conjunction with covered bonds and asset-backed securities (ABS) purchased since October 2014, the monthly pace of the combined asset purchase is set at about 60 billion euros. Except for very long-dated assets, the remaining maturity of eligible public sector assets to be purchased must be within two to 30 years. In principle, the assets need to be investment grade (above BBB–). This policy may be regarded as a reaction to growing concerns over the potentially weakened effectiveness of monetary easing as a result of the shrinking balance sheet amid a decline in some inflation expectation indicators. Although the interest rate applied to a central bank’s asset purchases is generally determined through supply and demand forces in the relevant market, the ECB applies the deposit facility rate of minus 0.2 percent as a floor rate. With regard to the second common monetary-easing instrument, forward guidance has been adopted by the two central banks with the objective of indicating a future direction for the ongoing monetary easing. This is expected to produce a signaling effect. The most commonly observed form is to signal the intention to maintain a significantly low policy interest rate over a long period. This instrument is supposed to exert downward pressure on the short- to medium-term yield curve to achieve additional monetary easing. Moreover, forward guidance could also be used to signal a central bank’s future stance over an ongoing asset purchase program, and thereby exert downward pressure mainly on the long-term yield curve (albeit dependent on the remaining maturity spectrum of purchased assets). Unlike the Federal Reserve, the BOJ has had no forward guidance related to a policy interest rate since the BOJ switched its main operating target for money market operations from the uncollateralized overnight call rate to a monetary base when it introduced QQE in 2013. The BOJ thus applies forward guidance to indicate its future stance over the continuation of QQE as a package (monetary base targeting together with the size and type of assets to be purchased). Forward guidance is expressed mainly according to the following outcome-based statement: The Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. That statement is followed by a qualifying clause, which declares that both the upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices will be examined and that adjustments to QQE will be made as appropriate. The BOJ’s forward guidance therefore signals a condition that determines continuation of QQE provided no major risks materialize. Given that the short- to medium-term yield curve was lowered substantially under the previous comprehensive monetary easing (October 2010 to March 2013), the intention with the forward guidance related to QQE is to exert downward pressure on the longer-term yield curve.1 At the same time, this form of forward guidance is expected to raise inflation expectations – considering that maintaining a price stability target of 2 percent in a stable manner is equivalent to anchoring inflation expectations at around 2 percent. With the ECB, forward guidance was first applied to policy interest rates in July 2013. It was achieved in terms of the following statement: “The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.” In September 2014, when the ECB cut policy rates by 10 basis points – to 0.05 percent for the main refinancing operations (MRO), 0.3 percent for the marginal lending facility, and minus 0.2 percent for the deposit facility – ECB President Mario Draghi reported that further downward adjustments would no longer be possible. Thus, the ECB’s present forward guidance refers to the duration of maintaining the ongoing low policy interest rates. The ECB also adopted forward guidance in March 2015 to signal its future stance over combined monthly asset purchases of about 60 billion euros with the following remark: “Intended to be carried out until the end of September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until we see                                                 1  The BOJ also purchases short-term treasury bills and maintains a 0.1-percent interest rate on excess reserves (IOER). Those moves have helped promote market expectations that very short-term market interest rates would remain substantially low for a long period. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.” The third common monetary-easing instrument is a conditional long-term lending facility. The BOJ provides low-cost funding (fixed at 0.1 percent) to financial institutions up to an amount that is twice the net increase in their lending – with a maximum of four years under the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility. This measure is planned to continue until June 2016. Similarly, the ECB launched Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) in September 2014. Since March 2015, TLTROs have provided low-cost funding (at interest rate on MRO) to financial institutions up to an amount three times as much as the net increase in lending to non-financial firms and households (excluding loans to households for house purchases). Currently, the maximum is three years; TLTROs are scheduled to continue until June 2016. Both Japan and the euro area are characterized by a system of bank-based financial intermediations; thus, the ultimate goal with these instruments is to promote bank lending to the private sector. At the same time, they could also help expand the central bank’s balance sheet. III. Unconventional monetary policies – differences between the BOJ and ECB I would now like to examine differences in monetary-easing policies (Chart 2). A. Background to the ECB’s adoption of a negative deposit facility rate The ECB adopted its first negative deposit rate of minus 0.1 percent in June 2014, followed by minus 0.2 percent the following September. I believe that three main factors contributed to the ECB’s decision to maintain the negative interest rate up to the present. First, there are many nonresident holders of government bonds in the euro area: their holdings account for over 50 percent of outstanding bonds issued. The types of nonresident investors are also diverse, ranging from short-term-oriented hedge funds to long-term-oriented institutional investors and foreign central banks. Some of those investors are therefore likely to sell government bonds to the ECB in search of capital gains without being overly affected by the negative interest rate or with the need to rebalance their portfolios, giving higher weight to corporate bonds and stocks in the euro area. Second, as long as potentially large demand exists for credit among firms and households, financial institutions in the euro area could be encouraged to extend credit to the private sector in an attempt to avoid a negative deposit rate, or they may be able to charge a higher lending rate without restraining credit demand. Consequently, financial institutions may achieve profits that will more than offset the negative interest rate by promoting credit creation. Third, given the presence of segmentation in the cross-border interbank markets in the euro area after the global financial crisis, the negative interest rate policy is unlikely to harm the behavior of liquidity-abundant financial institutions. B. The BOJ’s decision to hold a positive interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) By contrast, the BOJ has maintained a 0.1-percent IOER since 2008. I would like to explain the broad background behind this decision. That is, it is important to note that QQE was adopted in an environment that provided little room for further cuts in short- to medium-term interest rates. To generate a large-scale monetary-easing effect, therefore, the BOJ decided to adopt a strategy of exerting downward pressure on real long-term interest rates; it did so through a decline in nominal long-term interest rates and an increase in inflation expectations. This strategy is more accommodative than a policy of seeking further marginal cuts in shorter-term interest rates. That said, I will give three reasons for the decision to keep a positive IOER. First, it reflects the view that further cuts in the IOER could give rise to a more challenging environment for the BOJ in terms of smoothly fulfilling the targeted amount of asset purchases. Unlike in the euro area, there are substantial numbers of resident holders of JGBs: the amount of their holdings accounts for over 90 percent of outstanding bonds issued. Many of those investors 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  are long-term-oriented financial institutions. With such a market structure, a positive IOER may have the effect of inducing those holders to sell government bonds to the BOJ. Second, a negative IOER may incur the risk of undermining the intermediary function of financial institutions by lowering profitability in the banking system. Banks may be unable to pass the increased cost (caused by the negative interest rate) on their retail depositors by lowering the deposit interest rate (which, at around 0 percent, is already low). Alternatively, financial institutions may attempt to raise their lending rates in an effort to maintain profits; however, that may discourage credit demand and thus undermine lending activities. Some European central banks charge a negative interest rate on both the deposit facility rate and on the main lending (refinancing) policy rate. Some of those financial institutions apparently apply a negative interest rate on the deposits of large clients and interbank markets as well as charging a higher lending rate for some corporate clients; they do this while maintaining a positive interest rate on retail deposits. This practice is unlikely to occur in Japan given that the loan-to-deposit rate remains around 70 percent and competition for lending is fierce. Banks may ultimately absorb the increased cost by squeezing their profit margins, thereby somewhat stifling the incentive to take credit risks by increasing lending activities. Third, it is important to support the function of interbank markets to a certain degree by allowing arbitrage in interest rate transactions between banks holding current account balances at the BOJ and those without access to such accounts. Such transactions also enable market interest rates to function relatively effectively as reference interest rates, which are conducive to various other related financial transactions and monetary policy judgments.2 More importantly, the ECB faced a decline in some inflation expectation indicators and the accumulated disinflation risk in the second half of 2014, when a negative deposit facility rate was in place. This suggests that a positive impact of raising inflation expectations that the BOJ emphasizes could not really be expected at any significant level from a negative interest rate policy. Thus, although the feasibility of lowering the IOER should not be denied, such a policy needs to be better understood and properly discussed in light of differences in the financial market structures of each country and region. C. Differences in importance of credit easing between the BOJ and ECB Another difference between the ECB and BOJ is that the ECB’s monetary easing generally entails an element of credit easing. Recently, the lending rate charged on the private sector has dropped and credit growth has turned positive in the euro area. Nonetheless, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in some peripheral countries still face restrictive lending criteria, higher funding costs, and limited access to the credit volume. For these reasons, TLTROs aim to promote financial institutions’ lending activities by reducing their funding costs, thereby indirectly lowering the lending rates charged on the private sector. In addition, the ABS purchase program was initiated to activate the market through purchases of securities and promote the securitization market for bank loans, including those for SMEs. The ECB thus continues to place the priority on credit easing as the banking system has not yet fully recovered its financial intermediary function arising from the global financial and European debt crises. By contrast, Japan experienced a decline in the functions of the CP and corporate bond markets immediately after the global financial crisis. That caused the BOJ to purchase those assets as a credit-easing policy in 2009. However, Japan did not face a banking crisis, and                                                 2  In a speech I delivered in Italy in January 2013, I touched on the pros and cons of a cut in the IOER and suggested the positive impact of such a cut on correcting the yen’s excessive appreciation. However, after QQE, those arguments no longer apply. See Shirai, Sayuri, “Japan’s Monetary Policy in a Challenging Environment,” Speeches at the Bank of Italy and the Eurasia Business and Economics Society Conference Held in Rome (January 11–12), Bank of Japan, 2013. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  the balance sheet of the banking sector generally remains sound. Even before QQE, SMEs had therefore enjoyed an accommodative monetary environment, such as with low funding costs and availability of credit volumes. Credit easing has now become a less important element of monetary easing. IV. Inflation expectations in Japan and the euro area Let me now proceed with inflation expectations – a key to achieving the price stability target – starting with those of economists and market-based indicators before turning to those of households and firms. A. Japan’s agenda – restoring inflation expectations to around 2 percent According to economists whose long time-series data are available, their inflation expectations stood at around 2 percent before Japan entered the era of long-standing mild deflation (Chart 3). Medium- to long-term inflation expectations (i.e., five years ahead) remained around 2 percent in the first half of the 1990s. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) and short-term inflation expectations (i.e., one year ahead) were also around 2 percent until the early 1990s. From around 1992, after the collapse of the asset bubble, however, the rate of change in the CPI began to drop, turning negative from around 1999. The first half of this period coincided with a declining trend in real GDP growth rates. Since these rates were mostly lower than potential GDP growth rates, which had been on a declining trend, the output gap deteriorated significantly, generating downward pressure on actual prices (Chart 4). Short-term inflation expectations dropped in line with actual price performance: they turned negative around 1999 and subsequently fluctuated at about 0 percent before QQE.3 One interesting feature of medium- to long-term inflation expectations is that they were unstable from the second half of the 1990s to 2012, with year-on-year movements ranging from around 0.5 percent to 2 percent. It was evident that those inflation expectations were insufficient to raise the rate of change in the CPI and short-term inflation expectations. Inflation expectations thus did not fully play anchoring role. The BOJ’s expression of price stability may be attributable to the instability in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. In 2006, the BOJ introduced the concept of the understanding of medium- to long-term price stability and described price stability as, in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, approximately between 0 and 2 percent with the median of 1 percent. The BOJ’s description was clarified somewhat in 2009 to a positive range of 2 percent or lower, with a midpoint of around 1 percent, thereby eliminating the possibility of a 0-percent price change. In 2012, the BOJ introduced the price stability goal in the medium to long term, describing it as a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, while setting the goal at 1 percent for the time being. Despite these statements, it was not wholly clear whether the BOJ was ultimately pursing a 2-percent level or a lower one. Against this background, the BOJ adopted the 2 percent target and QQE in 2013 to restore medium- to long-term inflation expectations back to around 2 percent – the level that had been achieved over 20 years earlier. Since the introduction of QQE, medium- to long-term inflation expectations of economists and the inflation swap rate (implied five-year forward rate, five years ahead) have risen moderately and remain around 1 percent today. Nevertheless, the 2 percent target remains distant (Chart 3). From Japan’s experience, it is essential first to make a continuous improvement in the output gap and thereby steadily raise the rate of change in the CPI. In this regard, the output gap                                                 3  It must be noted that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, as well as short-term inflation expectations, rose substantially, owing to consumption tax hikes in 1997 and 2014, and the surge in commodity prices in early 2008. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  estimated by the BOJ turned positively to 0.1 percent in the January–March quarter of 2015. After a temporary deterioration projected for the April–June quarter, the output gap is expected to gradually improve in positive territory from the July–September quarter this year and increase its upward pressure on prices. The change in the core CPI (all items less fresh food) is currently about 0 percent. However, the CPI excluding food and energy is about 0.6 percent, which exceeds the core CPI. The proportion of items whose prices have risen among all core CPI-composing items has increased to around 65 percent (Chart 5). Moreover, some price hikes have accompanied increased sales. For those reasons, it is fair to say that there has been no deterioration in the underlying trend in prices. The BOJ projects that the rate of change in the core CPI will begin to rise from the second half of fiscal 2015. Once the rising trend of the core CPI becomes stable, inflation expectations are projected to rise gradually toward around 2 percent. B. Euro area’s inflation expectations: broadly consistent with the price stability target By contrast, in the euro area, the medium- to long-term inflation expectations of economists have been more or less stable at around 2 percent since the initial phase of adopting the euro (Chart 6). This is evident in two ways: one is that the rate of inflation had already moved to around 2 percent a few years prior to the euro adoption; the other is that the ECB initially defined price stability as inflation rates below 2 percent over the medium term. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations appear to have stabilized more firmly after the ECB further clarified its definition in 2003 as inflation rates below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. This situation changed somewhat after 2012, when the rate of change in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) began to decrease continuously. The decline occurred across a wide range of goods and services in the face of a re-deterioration in the output gap and a price drop in various commodities (Charts 7 and 8). Nevertheless, the HICP excluding food and energy remains at around 1 percent. Following the decrease in HICP, short-term inflation expectations declined significantly, whereas medium- to long-term inflation expectations decreased moderately; they currently stand at around 1.8 percent. The inflation swap rate (implied five-year forward rate, five years ahead) strengthened a declining trend from mid-2014 and reached around 1.5 percent by early 2015, which triggered concerns over the risk of disinflation. Thereafter, the inflation swap rate has increased moderately and recovered to around slightly below 2 percent, owing to the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase program (including an announcement effect) and the greater-than-expected performance of economic activity and prices. But most recently, the gap from the target has somewhat widened, partly owing to the recent re-drop in crude oil prices (Chart 6). A recent decline in the inflation swap rate is also observed in Japan. This might be a reflection of a decrease in inflation risk premium associated with declining oil prices rather than declining inflation expectations. C. Gap between households’ price perception and price performance in Japan: different feature from the euro area I would now like to turn to households’ price expectations and spending patterns. Owing to the lack of comparable data, I will use short-term data (about one year ahead). From the BOJ’s Opinion Survey on the General Public’s Views and Behavior, the following data are available from June 2006: (1) the perception diffusion index (DI) of present price levels (the present price perception DI); (2) the one-year-ahead price DI; and (3) the one-year-ahead spending DI. From the European Commission’s Business and Consumer Surveys, I will use the following data from 1999: (1) the price trend DI over the previous twelve months; (2) the price trend DI over the next twelve months; and (3) the spending expectation DI for major purchases (such as furniture and electrical or electronic devices) over the next twelve months. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  As a commonly observed feature, households in Japan and the euro area tend to perceive that the present price level represents an increase – except for a short period immediately after the global financial crisis – and they tend to expect higher price levels about one year ahead (Charts 9 and 10). Moreover, those households commonly tend to expect to spend less in the near future. From these features, it may be said that households plan to reduce their spending about one year ahead because they expect a tighter budget as a result of expected higher prices. A different feature is evident with regard to the relationship between actual price performance and households’ present price perception (as well as their one-year-ahead price expectation). In the euro area, households’ present price perception and price expectation DIs are roughly in line with actual price performance. By contrast, Japanese households’ present price perception (except for a short period immediately after the global financial crisis) and price expectation DIs remained positive even when mild deflation prevailed from 2009 to mid-2013. More recently, despite the rate of change in the core CPI having dropped to around 0 percent, the rising trend in the present price perception DI has been firm and the relatively high level of price expectation DI has been sustained. Thus, Japanese households’ price perceptions and expectations constantly differ from the movements of official price statistics. On this front, it is known that Japanese households’ price perceptions and expectations are heavily affected by the price movements of daily necessities and gasoline, resulting in an upward bias. This could be interpreted as a sign of a strong defensive action against the anticipated tighter budget. If so, households may perceive a rate of actual inflation of much higher than 2 percent in the process of approaching the 2 percent target, and regard such price rises as unacceptable. Thus, it is important for the BOJ to promote public understanding that its objective is to achieve a moderate price rise and a sustainable increase in household spending. Additionally, households’ tolerance for price rises needs to improve in accordance with a sustainable income rise. D. Euro area firms’ price expectations becoming comparable with those of Japan With respect to firms’ price expectations, the sales price expectation DI for three months ahead is available from the BOJ’s Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) and the European Commission’s surveys (Chart 11). One interesting finding is that in Japan, firms’ sales price expectation DI has fluctuated in negative territory since the first half of the 1990s, when the rates of change in the CPI remained positive. Among those firms, the DI of manufacturing firms remains negative today even though there has been improvement after the global financial crisis. By contrast, the euro area’s sales price expectation DI mostly moved in positive territory before the global financial crisis, which suggests that European manufacturing firms found it relatively easy to raise sales prices. However, especially after 2012, when the European debt crisis deepened, the sales price DI became sluggish and has since remained around 0 percent. This implies that European manufacturing firms now find it more challenging to raise their sales prices and are in a similar position to Japanese firms. An exception is Germany, where the sales price expectation DI has remained in positive territory despite a drop in the present sales price DI. This may indicate that German firms continue to provide more differentiated, higher value-added products than other firms in the euro area. With regard to the sales price expectation DI of non-manufacturing firms, the DI in Japan turned moderately positive after QQE, and it remains positive although low. The sales price expectation DI in the euro area has become stagnant – albeit with large fluctuations – following the European debt crisis. In three non-manufacturing sectors, the current DIs in services and retail trade are moderately positive, albeit at low levels, like those of Japanese firms. The DI of construction has mostly been in significantly large negative territory since the global financial crisis. In the case of Germany, the sales price expectation DI of services has shown a remarkable recovery and already exceeds the pre-crisis level. Nonetheless, the DI of retail trade has recently been at a low level, although moderately positive, which suggests 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  that consumption activities have not yet fully recovered. The DI in construction has been sluggish and was often negative even before the global financial crisis; the current level is low. E. Conclusions In the euro area, short-term price expectations of households and firms dropped after the financial crises and are currently stagnant; the medium- to long-term inflation expectations of economists and market-based indicators are somewhat below, but roughly in line with, the price stability target. This may suggest that the sluggish households’ and firms’ price expectations are temporary and that those expectations will eventually begin to rise as economic conditions improve. In Japan, the medium- to long-term inflation expectations of economists and market-based indicators remain around 1 percent. This is partly because the price rising trend – except for the oil price – seems to have been settling. This may imply that firms’ short-term sales price expectations, although still low, may begin to rise as the recovery process improves. Moreover, households’ price expectations tend to be substantially high owing to the upward bias, and they deviate substantially from actual price performance. However, such an upward bias may be corrected in the future once households’ tolerance for price rises gradually improves together with a sustainable income rise and more widespread understanding of the 2 percent target. That said, it is important for the BOJ to maintain an accommodative monetary environment to support economic recovery and make greater efforts to increase public awareness of that target and the BOJ’s intention. Thank you very much for your kind attention.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Carl-Ludwig Thiele: The euro − past pitfalls and future challenges Speech by Mr Carl-Ludwig Thiele, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the People’s Bank of China School of Finance, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 22 September 2015. *      *      * 1. Introduction Dear Professor Li, Dear Professor Kang, Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to be here in Beijing to talk to you about Europe and the euro – about the background and particular features of European monetary union, its pitfalls, which have placed Europe under great strain, and the challenges that we need to overcome if Europe is to remain a reliable player. European monetary union has its peculiarities, which makes it difficult to compare it with any other single currency area. It is only when one is aware of these particular features and the historical backdrop against which this currency area has emerged that it is possible to understand the causes of the crisis in the euro area – and the steps needed to overcome them. In my presentation, I will attempt to view European unification, a stable European monetary union and a prosperous euro area through the eyes of a realist. However, Walter Hallstein, the first President of the European Commission, apparently had a special kind of realist in mind when he said: “Whoever does not believe in miracles in European matters is not a realist.” I will come back to this at the end of my speech. 2. European unification Ladies and gentlemen, A united Europe is of major significance to Germany. This is not only because Germany is an integral part of Europe but also because the Germans feel a particular obligation to promote European unification. The reasons for this are largely historical. A glance back in history shows just how important mutual understanding and amicable relations are for the countries of Europe. The First World War broke out just over 100 years ago. This war has been etched into the memory of so many Europeans. The grim consequences of war are still fresh in our minds: a disturbingly high number of civilian and military victims, the wartime economy, hundreds of thousands impoverished or starved to death and survivors deeply traumatised. This list could go on and on. And the Second World War began only 21 years after the end of the First World War. It was a war in which unprecedented crimes were perpetrated, millions were left dead and Europe was subsequently divided into two blocs. After suffering so much at the hands of war, the west European countries strived for deeper European integration, for a united Europe. The reasons for this were many and varied. Securing peace within Europe was undoubtedly the dominant rationale. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The relationship between European neighbours France and Germany played a key role in this context. Hostility between the two nations, be it overt or latent, had persisted for centuries. This so-called “Franco-German enmity” was surmounted in the wake of the devastating Second World War and developed over time into a Franco-German friendship, an engine driving the process of European unification and integration. However, belonging to a community of values was of particular importance to Germany following the Hitler dictatorship and the Holocaust. Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, expressed this as follows: “The unity of Europe was the dream of a few. It became the hope of many. Today it has become a necessity for all of us.” But there was also a desire to sustainably improve Europe’s economic prosperity. It is not incidental that European integration began by stepping up economic integration. After the Second World War ended, progress was made on various fronts, culminating initially in the single European market. The foundations of this single European market were the “four basic freedoms”: the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. But it became evident at an early stage that economic integration in Europe could only really take off if it was accompanied by a stable single currency. As far back as the start of the 1970s, there existed a plan to establish a European economic and monetary union that was to be fully implemented by 1980. Ultimately, progress was not so rapid after all. No serious attempt to establish monetary union was made until Jacques Delors took over the presidency of the European Commission in the late 1980s. The Maastricht Treaty was later signed by EU member states in 1992. 3. European monetary union and its regulatory framework In 1999, the long-cherished dream of European monetary union became true, marking a major step towards deeper European integration. Introducing a single currency had tangible benefits. Prices of goods could be more easily compared throughout the member states. Exchange rate risk was eliminated and transaction costs fell. This in turn promoted trade, not only within the monetary union but also with the rest of the world. Money and capital markets converged further. And, last but not least, the euro brought with it a period of remarkable price stability for the member states. At this point, it is important to understand that the European monetary union is a thoroughly unique single currency area. While the 19 sovereign states within it have committed to comply with a single monetary policy, they remain responsible for their own fiscal and economic policies. This means that a single monetary policy, which has the clear objective of ensuring price stability, is accompanied by 19 national fiscal policies. As you can see, the principle of subsidiarity is constitutive for Europe: as many decisions as possible should continue to be made at the national, or even the local, level. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once highlighted the EU’s complex structure by asking: “Who do I call if I want to call Europe?” Nowadays, he would have to call 19 telephone numbers to discuss fiscal policy matters, as 19 national governments make decisions regarding public spending and any borrowing required for financing purposes. The universal rule that political processes can easily lead to increased spending and, as a result, to excessive borrowing as well applies far more to a monetary union with independent national fiscal policies than to central governments. This is because, in a monetary union, the negative effects of a sharp rise in debt in one country can spill over, at least in part, to the other member states. Why is that the case? Generally speaking, the same rules that apply to a private borrower also apply to a country: the higher the debt burden, the lower the creditworthiness. So, in a properly functioning capital market, a country that is more indebted is generally required to pay higher interest on its sovereign debt. However, things are different in a monetary union, as capital market participants assume that the member states belong to an “inseparable union with a common destiny” as part of which they will help each other out financially in emergency situations, forming a kind of joint-liability scheme. As a result, debt interest rises not only for the individual, more indebted country, but usually also for the other member states, which are expected to provide solidarity and financial assistance. Yet, for the country creating more debt, interest rates tend to rise less strongly. Monetary union, therefore, holds incentives for an individual member state to run up higher debt as the negative effects of greater indebtedness – meaning higher borrowing rates – are partly borne by the other member states. This can be compared with the overfishing of the seas as it, too, affects both the community of neighbouring countries as well as the country causing the problem. The architects of monetary union were well aware of the problem of incentives. Which is exactly why they took precautions. It was, therefore, laid down from the start in the Treaty of Maastricht that a country is forbidden from assuming the debt of another country or the community of states. In other words, this laid down the foundation for a general no bail-out principle. The Maastricht Treaty is, thus, guided by the principle of individual responsibility, or the balance of liability and control. In the concise words of German economist Walter Eucken: “Whoever reaps the benefits must also bear the liability.” Or, in very down-to-earth terms: Whoever orders, pays. An additional security threshold for monetary union as a stability union is the prohibition of monetary financing of governments. The central banks of the Eurosystem, that is the European Central Bank and the 19 national central banks, are forbidden from directly financing euro-area countries. In order for this ban on monetary financing of governments to be implemented in practice, the independence of the Eurosystem from political instructions was enshrined at the same time. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Political decision-makers cannot, therefore, force the central banks of the Eurosystem to grant member states loans or directly purchase their sovereign paper. Ultimately, these measures could contravene the mandate of ensuring price stability, causing lasting harm to the Eurosystem’s credibility and thus to the very foundations of a successful monetary policy. Germany has, in the past, had bad experiences with central banks which were not free of political lobbying. For example, expenditure on arms in the First World War was financed directly by the central bank, which essentially catered to the needs of the government. The consequence was a complete devaluation of the Reichsmark. By contrast, the independence of the Eurosystem was firmly anchored. First, institutionally, by prohibiting national and supranational institutions from issuing the ECB or the national central banks with instructions. And second, functionally, by awarding the sole prerogative regarding strategies and measures to ensure price stability to the Eurosystem. The independence of the central banks is further safeguarded by specific debt ceilings, which are intended to prevent member states from accumulating excessive debt. A country’s public deficit is not supposed to exceed a maximum of 3% of its GDP within a one-year period. Moreover, a country’s overall sovereign debt should not go beyond 60% of its annual GDP. These rules are designed to prevent governments from exerting pressure on monetary policy makers, as lower interest rates allow governments to borrow more cheaply. Or due to the fact that existing debt is devalued by a higher rate of inflation. So far so good. 4. Crisis However, things turned out differently than expected – above all because the carefully drafted financial policy rules were not complied with. Most countries were far from having a balanced budget, and public deficits often even exceeded the three-percent threshold. Debt levels in the member states were often not lowered either. The exact opposite was the case in some countries for that matter. At the same time, market participants did not trust sufficiently in the no bail-out principle I touched on earlier. Despite the very large differences in debt levels and economic developments among the euro-area member states, they aligned their risk premiums to a great extent, which, in turn, led to the already strongly indebted countries becoming more indebted. In the end, confidence in the capital markets vanished with regard to whether the future crisis countries would still be able to service their sovereign debt in accordance with the rules. This culminated in investors granting these countries loans only at very high interest margins or withholding them altogether. At the same time, it became clear that the countries that were later hit by crisis had failed to set up sound and sustainable economic structures that were beneficial for growth. Instead, enterprises and households often took advantage of the substantially lower interest rates as a result of joining the euro area and ran up great amounts of debt. And rather than investing this money in expanding competitiveness, it was used for private and government consumption. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Wages increased to a considerably larger extent than productivity, with price competitiveness eroding as a result. And last but not least, cheap loans and capital inflows fuelled the real estate bubbles in Ireland and Spain. This is why this “special boom”, which was caused by low interest rates, was anything but sustainable and sparked the crisis in Europe. Although, to be precise, “the crisis” was a conglomerate of various crises, encompassing financial market crisis, economic crisis and sovereign debt crisis. Above all, however, it is a crisis of confidence, the complexity of which is also reflected in the fact that the euro area has been battling to overcome this crisis for seven years now. 5. Overcoming the crisis How can this finally be achieved? Or, put differently, what lessons are to be learned from the crisis? To win back the confidence lost and to return to a path of sustainable growth, we need to tackle the root causes of the crisis instead of treating the symptoms. The economic situation in the euro area may be recovering, but there are still some structural challenges to resolve. And until the causes of the crisis have been eliminated, we cannot be sure that it will not pop up again. The most recent discussions on Greece have shown this only too well. 5.1 Measures in the member states First of all, the crisis countries themselves must eliminate the causes of the crisis at home. For one thing, they have to ensure that their public debt is sustainable. This needs to be done before consumer and investor confidence can return. Indeed, as the saying goes, “you can’t borrow your way out of a debt crisis”. Therefore, lasting confidence can only be built on a foundation of sound public finances. In addition to having budgetary rigour, member states also need to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms. Many of these have already been set in motion as a result of the sovereign debt crisis. As such, not only have structural budget deficits been significantly lowered, but the deterioration of international competitiveness has also been largely reversed. But there is still some way to go in terms of making the labour markets more flexible, further liberalising the goods and services markets and cutting bureaucracy. To begin with, these adjustment processes are a burden on the economic recovery of many of the crisis countries. However, the subsequent positive growth effects more than make up for this. Spain, in particular, is currently experiencing this first-hand and is already reaping the benefits of the structural reforms it has implemented. Since 2009, its structural budget balance has improved by roughly seven percentage points and its labour market has been made more flexible. Both of these achievements were decisive factors in enabling the Spanish economy to lift itself out of recession quite some time ago and to exhibit its current strong growth. The oppressively high levels of unemployment are also gradually decreasing. The benefits for Spain will be all the higher in the coming years if it remains fully faithful to this reform process. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  There is a saying I like that practically passes as a Chinese proverb in Germany. It reads: “When the winds of change are blowing ... some people build walls and some people build windmills.” Well, the Spanish have built quite a few windmills in recent years. In the first half of this year, the world’s attention was focused on Greece to a much greater extent than on Spain and its successful reform process. In light of the refusal of the Greek government to accept the bail-out conditions, and due to acute financing needs, there was even speculation about whether the country would potentially have to leave the euro area or even the European Union itself. This risk has since vanished, thanks to the adoption in August of a third assistance programme for Greece, which is subject to strict conditions and temporarily resolved the country’s funding bottleneck. However, further payments are contingent on Greece fulfilling these conditions. In addition, the central challenge facing Greece lies in implementing structural reform measures for greater competitiveness as well as achieving sound government finances in the long term and establishing a functioning administration. Only then will Greece overcome its current period of weakness and embark on a path of growth. 5.2 Reforming the regulatory framework However, aside from the unsound developments in European periphery countries, the euro area’s regulatory framework also needs to be strengthened. The principle of aligning liability and control must once again be more rigorously enforced. This is because, over the course of combating the crisis, the element of joint liability has been increasingly expanded. This, in turn, has severely disrupted the balance between liability and control. The crisis countries were granted large-scale emergency loans by other member states and the European Stabilisation Mechanism. But the Eurosystem also reacted, for example by not only lowering interest rates, but also by loosening the requirements for monetary policy collateral. In addition, the Eurosystem acquired government bonds of crisis countries on the capital markets in order to ensure monetary policy had a more uniform impact. However, this propelled the Eurosystem deep into uncharted and dangerous territory, blurring the boundary to prohibited monetary financing of governments. That being said, all parties are well aware that monetary policy is unable to resolve the crisis in the euro area, and is merely buying time for policy makers to implement the necessary measures. In order to permanently safeguard monetary union as a union for stability, it is important to bring liability and control back into a more balanced position. Essentially, this can be done in two ways: either the euro area evolves into a genuine fiscal union, where fiscal and tax policies are coordinated centrally at European level ... ... or a Maastricht Framework 2.0 is established in which the principle of individual responsibility is reinforced. However, I do not see a majority in any euro-area country supporting the communitisation of fiscal and tax policies. At the current juncture, reinforcing the existing regulatory framework and strengthening the principle of individual responsibility therefore seems like a more realistic way of bringing liability and control in Europe’s monetary system back into equilibrium. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Europe has already taken some steps in the right direction in this regard. For example, the refined fiscal rules require balanced budgets or even slight surpluses. In addition, procedures have been introduced to identify and rectify macroeconomic imbalances. However, these rules need to be enforced. And this is where we have a clear deficit. “Flexibility” is the European Commission’s new watchword when it comes to interpreting how the fiscal framework should be implemented. And the scope for flexible interpretation has actually widened over the past few years on the back of changes to the budgetary rules. However, sustained economic growth cannot be built on a foundation of resurgent expanding public debt. For as I already mentioned, lasting confidence and long-term growth are only possible through sound public finances. Ladies and gentlemen, Thus far I have touched on two key areas where there are lessons to be learned from the crisis: first, that individual countries need to implement reforms themselves and second, the need to strengthen and strictly adhere to a regulatory framework in which liability and control at the national level are balanced – as envisaged for the euro area from the start. 5.3 European banking union Moreover, as the crisis unfolded, the financial system was exposed as the Achilles’ heel, not just in Europe but on an international scale. As a result, steps were taken at the G20 level to tighten banks’ capital and liquidity requirements, thus giving rise to Basel III. Compounding this, weaknesses were identified in Europe’s banking supervision structures. National supervisors were often found to assess their own country’s banking system too favourably, with the effect that failing banks and stumbling states dragged one another down. Only by destroying the harmful nexus between banks and governments will we be able to manage these contagion effects. And this is where the nascent European banking union comes into play. It represents a major step towards deepening European integration and consists of two elements: The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which operates under the aegis of the ECB, has been in place for just under 12 months. Its purpose is to ensure consistently high supervisory standards so as to prevent banks, at an early stage, from getting into difficulties. But such problems cannot be entirely ruled out, not even under a stringent regulatory regime. After all, the possibility of failure is a hallmark of any market economy. It is therefore important to be able to allow banks to fail without governments – and thus also taxpayers – having to foot the bill. For banks must also be subject to the liability principle, without which no market economy can function properly. This is the rationale behind the launch of the European Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) in 2016. The mechanism will make sure that non-viable institutions can be withdrawn from the market in an orderly fashion provided this does not jeopardise financial stability. And this will be done according to a clearly defined liability cascade. 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  If a bank is wound down in future, shareholders and creditors will be first in line to bear the costs. Only when this source of funds proves insufficient will there be recourse to a single resolution fund financed by the entire European banking sector. And only as a last resort will taxpayers in the respective country, or even in other member states, be called upon to help shoulder the burden. In other words, beginning in 2016, institutions subject to supervision at the European level will also be resolved at this level. This will facilitate closer European integration. Together, these two constructs, the SSM on the one hand and the SRM on the other, form a meaningful whole, in which liability and control are balanced. 5.4 Abolishing the preferential treatment of government bonds If the close ties between governments and banks are to be loosened, in future loans to sovereigns must no longer be deemed free of risk in regulatory terms. It follows that government bonds should henceforth be treated similarly to loans to enterprises and households, meaning they should be backed by capital commensurate with the risk. And limits also need to be applied to such exposures, as is the case with loans to private debtors. This would prevent risk from becoming concentrated on banks’ balance sheets. These topics are now being deliberated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Economic and Financial Committee, and rightly so. I appreciate that capital requirements and large exposure limits make the task of financing governments more complicated and consequently more expensive. Thus, gradual phase-ins are undeniably a good idea. However, this is no reason to refrain from change. 5.5 Sovereign insolvency code Looking ahead, there is an additional area where new regulatory provisions are required. In extreme cases, sovereigns, too, must in future be able to declare themselves insolvent, as the liability principle should also apply to them. Otherwise, the Eurosystem could come under pressure to finance cash-strapped governments at knock-down terms. So what happens when a sovereign defaults? It doesn’t mean that the country concerned disappears off the map in the way that a company might. Rather, the government in question finds itself no longer able to service its debt as contractually agreed, normally meaning that this debt has to be restructured. The legal basis for this would have to be provided by a sovereign insolvency code. In my opinion, this is an essential prerequisite for an enduringly sustainable regulatory framework in which fiscal policy remains a national responsibility. 6. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, In my presentation, I have shone a light on the history of European integration and the crisis in the euro area. I have also looked towards the future, and outlined the challenges that lie ahead and how we might best deal with them. The most significant aspects are as follows. It is the member states who hold the key to sustainably overcoming the crisis in Europe. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  The European banking system, the member states and the European regulatory framework have to be made more crisis-resistant so that the euro area can return to a path of sustainable growth. As I mentioned earlier on, there’s plenty of good news at all three of these levels. But that doesn’t mean we can declare the crisis over. The adjustment process in the crisis countries is likely to continue for quite some time. The tightened regulatory framework needs to be applied more forcefully in practice and additional measures will have to be introduced. Ultimately, the only way to overcome the crisis ... ... is to gradually rebuild confidence. But this is only possible if the euro area consistently maintains its stability course. As far as the euro area is concerned, I see no reason to be overly pessimistic. What matters is that the member states continue to muster the will to rigorously tackle the root causes of the crisis. I began this speech with a reference to Walter Hallstein’s conviction to the effect that: “Whoever does not believe in miracles in European matters is not a realist.” But where do I stand with regard to this quotation now that my speech is coming to a close? Well, as I see things, we do not need any miracles in Europe today. The foundations for achieving stability in the euro area are already in place. However, these need to be enhanced in some important respects and they should be rigorously enforced. It will not be a walk in the park. But neither is it the stuff of miracles. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: Digital Darwinism and the financial industry – a supervisor’s perception Speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Speech at the EBS (EBS University of Business and Law) Symposium, Oestrich-Winkel, 18 September 2015. *      *      * 1. Introduction Ladies and gentlemen Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this EBS Symposium. As a banking supervisor, I am happy to share with you my thoughts on digital Darwinism in the financial industry. 2. Digital transition from an evolutionary perspective Dinosaurs are an often-used means of illustrating how “Darwinism” works. We still don’t really know why those creatures – which ruled the earth for millions of years – suddenly became extinct. Some make volcanic eruptions responsible; others cite meteorites or a sharp drop in sea level as a possible explanation. In any case, the assumption is not that dinosaurs ceased to exist because they could not cope with their new environment or adapt quickly enough. Applying this diagnosis to the financial sector, where banks have reigned throughout the last few centuries, and supposing that the digital transition indeed constitutes a new environment for banks, one may pose a rather provocative question: are banks dinosaurs that will one day become extinct? You may guess that I do not share this doom scenario, so let me start out by describing my views on the evolution of the banking business. The digital era may indeed be considered a new environment for banks. Digitalisation of the financial sector is an irrevocable change that came about due to several factors. First, the digitalisation of the financial sector has been fuelled by the development of highly effective, state-of-the-art technologies like broadband networks, advances in data processing and the ubiquity of smartphones. And there is a premise that is common to virtually all technological advances in market economies in the last few centuries: when a product becomes available, sooner or later it creates its own demand and puts market forces into action. That means technological and social changes are intertwined. Bank customers are becoming increasingly open to digital banking. Think of innovative concepts such as online video consultation services, digital credit brokerage and the incorporation of social media into banking. Banking is still a “people business”, but it’s no longer reduced to proximate and personal relationships. So there is plenty of demand for use of the technological potential of digital banking: cheap and quick automatised processes, solutions for complex financial issues, service tailored to customers’ individual needs. A fundamental challenge that banks now face is that in some business fields, we may expect a sudden and rapid change of the game that is being played. One rather obvious case in point is that of payment services. Service providers such as PayPal or Apple have implemented payment systems geared to consumers in a digital environment. Once customers become used to a new way of paying, competitors offering similar products will certainly have difficulties trying to convince customers to switch providers. The pioneer may have a decisive advantage. Now, in evolutionary terms, the question is whether banks can adapt quickly enough. Banks have used IT for decades, but these fast-moving times present wholly new possibilities for its use: P2P lending becomes feasible, internet and mobile applications are sprouting up and 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  internet giants such as Google or Facebook are cultivating “big data” methods. These enterprises have grown up with – at times – entirely new perceptions of business, work and life. And they have the appropriate staff. That may be crucial. It is one thing to build new ideas, but quite another to incorporate them into the company DNA. Traditional banks, on the other hand, typically do not have a digital DNA. Theirs is an analogue world in which they have refined their knowledge about banking over decades and built up a customer relationship based on trust. Think of areas like investment advice and corporate finance as well as banks’ own business of generating synergies between business strands. The question now is: what part of their knowledge is still valuable and what part do banks need to reframe? However, we cannot predict how the financial sector will look in ten years’ time. There are just too many “unknown unknowns”. Still, there is a recurring fallacy that reduces evolution to a narrow one-way street. If there are new market entrants whose businesses are well-adjusted to the digital environment, banks should be inclined to imitate their behaviour. But – to be clear – there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for digital banking. As in other industries, there will always be demand for more differentiated strategies, for example individual and personalised services as opposed to algorithm-based advice. Also, we should not be surprised to see the focus return to a key component of the banking business: establishing safety and trust. Furthermore, the digital age does not simply redistribute market shares of a fixed revenue pie: there are also entirely new opportunities for desirable businesses. Convenient banking is valuable. Banks could benefit from this, either through greater customer loyalty or through additional business volumes resulting from extra services. Win-win schemes are also conceivable in credit markets. “Big data” methods can generate highly informative individual risk profiles. This could enable banks to extend loans to private customers and small businesses which would otherwise not receive any financing. Even investment counselling could benefit. Video-based consulting, for example, does more than reflect modern life style of customers; it may also reduce costs for banks by rendering some branch offices unnecessary. Other keywords of digital openings are “co-creation”, where customers participate in the development of products, and “multichannel banking”. But my aim today is not to present an all-encompassing overview on digital bank business ideas. Instead, let us move one step back and look at the bigger picture. Reshaping the financial sector doesn’t need to be left to new market entrants. This creative challenge can also be taken up by established banks. Supervisors, too, have an interest in seeing banks engage in innovation if this enhances the functionality of the financial sector and stabilises profitability in the medium and long run. To sum up, there is an “open end” to the evolution of the digital financial sector. If you ask diehard evolutionists for a forecast of the future, they will merely point to a trial-and-error process that should eventually give us an answer. For an individual company, that is of course not helpful. As a banking supervisor, I am not inclined to attempt a market forecast. Still, there is a bottom line for banks from the line of thought I outlined earlier, namely that it is appropriate neither to blindly imitate nor to stick to old habits. The message to every player in the financial industry is simple: rather than being caught off-guard, banks have to participate actively in shaping future banking services. A new game is being played, and new strategies need to be developed and executed decisively. 3. Cyber risks – an evolutionary attachment to the digital bank Along with the digitalisation of industries, there is another evolution that warrants our attention. It is a development that is neither intended by the visionaries and trailblazers of the digital world nor beneficial. I am referring to the evolution of cybercrime. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  While we cannot predict how banking will look in ten or twenty years’ time, we can be almost certain that risks of fraud, theft and manipulation in banks through cyberspace will continue to rise. The reason is straightforward: digital channels can be used to steal a lot of assets with comparatively little effort today. Nowadays, a large proportion of banks’ assets and value-generating capability is stored on hard drives and servers. The technical infrastructure facilitates the managing of bank accounts and grants access to money. But it also provides access to vast sources of data. There have been several incidents recently of truly large-scale data theft. Company secrets, too, are at stake. If, for example, the trading algorithms of your bank became known to others through illegal activities, they could be exploited in the market, causing huge losses to banks. In the same way, politically motivated acts of sabotage jeopardise trust in financial functions and integrity. Looking at those on the other side of cybercrime, the potential attackers – they often have access to far more powerful weapons than before and convenient access through the internet. Targeted attacks on IT systems can originate from anywhere in the world. Hackers often need little more than a laptop with internet access. Why do we have to expect a continuous evolution in this field? Attack vehicles like computer viruses differ widely and may target any chink in a bank’s defence, rather as human viruses attack biological systems. Its logic follows the arms race between criminals and law enforcers that can be traced down through human history, but is now taking place with digital weapons. What makes this evolution more dangerous still is that we now face a highly complex digital world where progress is constantly being made in technologies and innovations. But, crucially, you cannot risk a trial-and-error process here. Once an easy point of attack is identified in the IT infrastructure, the word will quickly spread and criminals from all over the world will try to exploit the weakness. On top of this, we need to bear in mind that cyber and general IT risks are not only of a technical nature. The human factor often plays a crucial part. Employees may act in gross negligence, or they may be tricked by a Trojan horse or a phishing mail. In complex IT systems, even small system errors can quickly cause enormous damage. The error-prone human factor can only be eliminated by installing an appropriate system of controls and incentives. In today’s world, this is an important management task. 4. Adaptation as a managerial task Before IT-related problems came to affect the very core of the digital economy, they were commonly shifted to the IT department. But this approach to IT risks is outdated. Awareness of digital risks and setting up a strategy are now a leader’s duties. If your business crucially relies on digital processing, any strategic decision at the company level requires knowledge and understanding of risks. Besides, we frequently observe that banks find it difficult to reorganise their IT systems. While a complete, “big bang” overhaul may be preferable, it often meets with resistance from many parts of the company. To avoid being locked into more and more outdated structures, banks should not just consider the expected short-term benefits when designing their IT strategy. Furthermore, the digital world demands from banks’ managers something I would describe as unbiased attentiveness towards new technologies. If banks don’t think “digitally”, they’re going to find it difficult to compete for digital customers. They have to reassess their client relations and even rethink different lifestyles and social trends. The individual needs and wishes of customers are more pivotal than ever before. Take a look at social networks, at online shopping or even at information research – consumers are already used to having their own needs catered for. Consequently, banks will have to get into the habit of looking at things from the customer’s perspective. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Let us also bear in mind that competition is becoming more global and more transparent, the competitors more diverse. In addition to FinTech companies, other industries with a strong IT focus are only one step away from the banking world. This means that the lines between industries are becoming blurred. Now more than ever, banks need to be aware of what the competition is doing so that they can review and refine their own strategies. From an evolutionary perspective, adaptability is another essential attribute. The digital world welcomes experimentation, is prone to sudden trends, and is constantly changing. Although the banking industry may not always be subject to all of this constant movement, adaptability is definitely becoming more important. So a flexible IT infrastructure that supports adaptability, for example, will be vital. Business models can also be more open and flexible in structure. Just think of the “digital ecosystem” strategies banks are now deploying. 5. Towards a resilient sector As a banking supervisor, I am wholeheartedly in favour of the goal of a stable sector. But this should not be understood as adopting a static view towards stability. For a workable financial industry, it is not decisive whether services are provided offline or online, by humans or by automated services. Our yardstick needs to measure whether the sector continues to fulfil its duty towards the real economy, which is to transform risks and provide payment and other financial services. That’s what is meant by a resilient financial sector. To that end, we have to ensure there are no “dead ends” to the digital evolution in the financial industry. I refer to IT-related risks in particular. If we rely on computers and digitalised processes, we have to make sure that they are reliable and trustworthy. Sector-wide reputation and functionality are at stake. Nowadays, a customer’s personal payment information is stored not only at the bank but at a multitude of service providers and retailers as well. How can a bank ensure the safety of its payment services against a cyber-attack on a retailer’s network or on that of a third-party vendor? Combined efforts should be seen as insurance. You never know who will be the next victim of an attack. And attacks don’t stop at borders, so cooperation of this kind is also needed at the global level. In an interconnected and therefore interdependent financial sector, strengthening the common defence should also be in the banks’ very own interest. 6. Conclusion Let me restate my views on “digital Darwinism”. Adaptation to a digitalised financial world does not simply require banks to develop new and ground-breaking ideas. It has more to do with a well-adjusted strategy – which means that it’s not just a race between development departments, but between leaders. As a supervisor, I therefore urge that we do not interpret digital competition as a race merely for the most advanced technologies, but for the right mix. This is why I am not in favour of comparing banks to dinosaurs. Traditional banks may typically have a pre-digital DNA, but they are capable of learning, adapting to a digital landscape and cooperating with technological pioneers. And each bank needs to find its own strategy. Banking business itself is as irreplaceable as ever before. So what will not change? Business success will continue to hinge on entrepreneurial skills. In an increasingly digital finance sector, the role of banking will still be to serve the real economy. And banking is based on trust. To keep this in mind will be key to ensuring a thriving and stable financial sector. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: Interest rate reversal in the United States and German banks Introductory statement by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the annual meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik, Münster, 17 September 2015. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen The British rock band The Alan Parsons Project charted in 1978 with a single entitled “What goes up ...”, the first two lines of which read as follows: “What goes up, must come down / What must rise, must fall”. These words of wisdom are also worth heeding in the financial markets – indeed, they’re the secret of any successful trader. But interestingly, the precise opposite also holds true in the financial markets. So, we could equally say: “Interest rates that fall, must rise again.” But for now, the euro area is still in the midst of a protracted spell of very low interest rates. It goes without saying that this low-interest-rate environment is making itself felt on banks – particularly on those whose business models are very reliant on interest income. So it’s not surprising that many a German credit institution is struggling with weak earnings. That’s a topic which has been on the agenda for quite some time now. Incidentally, we will be getting a better idea of how German banks are coping with the currently low level of interest rates next week – on 18 September, to be precise, when the Bundesbank and BaFin will be releasing the findings of a joint survey on the low-interest-rate environment. What can banks do? In a nutshell, banks should act on the meagre state of their earnings at present by reflecting on their business models and tapping fresh sources of income. While The Alan Parsons Project might have a point, living off ever-diminishing resources and simply sitting tight until interest rates reverse isn’t what I would consider the right course of action. That’s because interest rates in the euro area are likely to remain very low for some time to come – the low rate of inflation, the modest economic outlook and the ECB’s forward guidance suggest as much. The picture is a different one across the pond. For all extents and purposes, the United States already began edging towards the monetary policy exit back in May 2013. That was when the US Federal Reserve announced its plans to “taper” its bond purchase programme. So a possible interest rate hike would represent a return to conventional monetary policy terrain. And it is not so much the timing of the interest rate move that matters as the subsequent interest rate path which the Fed follows. What would a return to normal policy rate conditions in the United States mean for the euro area and for Germany’s banks? Since 2013 we have observed that policy divergence between the United States and the euro area has had two knock-on effects. First, the differential between US and euro-area interest rates has widened; second, the euro exchange rate has dwindled. This trend gained traction early this year when the Eurosystem announced the large-scale purchase of government bonds. That increased the spread between US Treasuries and German Bunds and sent the euro plummeting against the dollar. So German banks need to remember that even if the Fed raises its policy rates, the spell of low interest rates in the euro area looks set to continue. Remember what I said just a few minutes ago – sitting tight and hoping for the best simply isn’t an option. And as far as possible exchange rate volatility is concerned, banks might theoretically be exposed to currency risk. Two factors play a role here. The first is banks’ funding gap in dollars. That gap measures the excess of a bank’s US dollar assets over its US dollar liabilities. The bigger this overhang, the more exposed the bank is to exchange rate risk. The second factor is the 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  mismatch between the maturities of assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars. This maturity mismatch measures both exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. At the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, both the funding gap and the maturity mismatch of German banks were very large indeed. When the forex markets dried up and German banks got cut off from US dollar funding, the central banks had to step in and lend a helping hand. Since then, the ECB, to name but one, has been providing swap facilities, but the take-up now is virtually non-existent. German banks have reduced their vulnerability since those days, slashing their funding gap by downsizing their stock of US dollar assets. What remains substantial, though, is the scale of the maturity mismatch of their US dollar investments. However, the actual risk exposure here is relatively small, because German banks these days are much better hedged against currency risk than they were just a few years ago. All in all, then, the expected interest rate reversal in the United States is unlikely to impact strongly on German banks – and it’s not as if the move is coming entirely out of the blue. And that’s a point worth noting, because there are three qualities that are crucial for any exit from an accommodative monetary policy – transparency, predictability and communication. We are unlikely to see a turnaround in euro-area interest rates in the near future. In closing, I would like to quote again from The Alan Parsons Project: “Someday, you’ll know where you are”. Thank you for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Interview in Neue Zürcher Zeitung Interview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in Neue Zürcher Zeitung, conducted by by Ms Claudia Aebersold Szalay and Mr Peter A Fischer and published on 19 September 2015. *      *      * Mr Praet, you have been Chief Economist of the ECB for the past four years now. During this period, the policy of the ECB has changed somewhat. Does it make a difference who the Chief Economist of the ECB is? Both the President and the Chief Economist have changed, but what has changed most of all during this period is the economic environment in which we find ourselves. At the onset of the crisis in 2007, we still thought we were simply dealing with an external liquidity shock. So, the central banks across the globe reacted accordingly, and at the time the ECB also focused on providing liquidity to banks. I can still remember the headlines back then, saying that the ECB was providing €100 billion in liquidity, which seemed an incredible sum at the time. The crisis nonetheless escalated. Yes, it quickly turned into a credit crunch, which in 2012 escalated into a euro crisis. However, to come back to your first question: the circumstances have changed dramatically; the identity of the Chief Economist plays a minor role in that sense. ECB decisions are not a “one-man show”, but rather the result of discussions amongst the members of the Governing Council. That is an open, professional and collegial exchange, and this is the basis on which the ECB’s Governing Council makes its decisions. You give the impression, however, that you take a more Anglo-Saxon approach, whereas your two predecessors, Issing and Stark, were rather more of the tradition of the Deutsche Bundesbank and were, therefore, more stability-oriented in their thinking. I would firmly disagree. I and the entire Executive Board of the ECB have utterly committed ourselves to price stability. That is our mandate, the task enshrined in the European treaties. We see price stability as symmetrical; it works in both directions. We fight inflation – when prices rise too quickly – with the same determination as when prices rise too slowly. And with our policy we have certainly been successful in terms of counteracting fears of deflation, I should like to think. All of our policies, including the less conventional ones, are aimed at maintaining price stability. By the way, during the time of my predecessor Otmar Issing, the ECB defined more precisely what is meant by price stability: below, but close to, 2%. However, on the issue of the purchase of government bonds, there has been a true break with past tradition. Your predecessors were strictly against it, whereas you and Mario Draghi are clearly in favour of these purchases. Who knows what my predecessors would have done in my position. They were not in a situation in which key interest rates had reached the lower limit, thereby leaving hardly any room for manoeuvre in terms of interest rates. However, I am sure that they would also have done everything necessary to fulfil the mandate. Besides, there was also a government bond purchase programme under the former President Jean-Claude Trichet, only it was much smaller than the current one. Critics say that the ECB has gone too far and that, with its ultra-expansionary policy, it has sown the seeds of the next crisis. We are well aware of the fact that an expansionary monetary policy entails some risks to financial stability. We are, nonetheless, convinced that we have acted in the right way, as we 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  have followed our mandate. As we are not seeing a strong rise in lending, nor any signs of widespread speculative bubbles, the risks for financial stability are currently limited. But monetary policy has taken over too much of the burden from politics during the crisis. It is true that too much weight has been placed on monetary policy in managing the crisis. I would also have liked other stakeholders to have taken more responsibility in this respect. But that does not change the fact that the ECB must act first and foremost in order to fulfil its mandate. The euro area has not given a good impression of itself during the crisis? One of the biggest problems was that the architecture of the euro area was not yet complete. We simply did not yet have all the institutions that are needed for quick and effective crisis management. The euro area already had important principles, such as the no bail-out clause, the prohibition of monetary financing and the no-exit clause. But serious design flaws also became apparent, which nurtured excesses and contributed to the scale of the crisis. And when several Member States faced financial difficulties… … the right structures were not in place in order to deal with them. No efficient mechanism to, if necessary, refinance public and private debt or restructure or resolve troubled banks. Nor were there any supranational institutions that were in a position to do so. Except the International Monetary Fund. Yes, there was the IMF, but to start with, many people in Europe were not too happy about the IMF being involved in the euro area. I was always in favour of having the IMF on board, because in Europe, we simply did not have any institution that could have taken on this role. In the meantime, has the institutional framework improved in the euro area? Yes, very much so. We now have the European Stability Mechanism, we have made good progress with the banking union, and we have a European supervisory mechanism. That is an important step and more will follow. The euro area needs more integration. Was the absence of an institutional framework the main problem behind the crisis? One of the main problems. The other problem was that the governments in the euro area had little fiscal room for manoeuvre in order to respond to the crisis. Exactly, the governments had to save. Was austerity wrong, because it forced governments to save? No, the return to sound national budgets was necessary, because, during the sovereign debt crisis, it was all a question of regaining confidence in the public finances in the euro area in order to curb speculation of a break-up of the euro. But, of course, the fact that the governments had so little fiscal room for manoeuvre led to a worsening of the crisis and meant the ECB had to do even more to still fulfil its mandate. Now the ECB is even pursuing quantitative easing, and, over the past six months, has been buying government bonds. Thus far, the ECB has purchased a good €400 billion worth of assets, by the autumn of 2016, it is supposed to amount to over €1 trillion. What is your assessment after six months? The ECB’s purchase programme is a success. It is already having an effect in terms of inflation expectations, for example, which have recovered again, and in terms of the general financing conditions, which have eased somewhat. But Mario Draghi is already talking about expanding the programme. He is repeating what we have said from the beginning, i.e. that the programme is flexible and can be adapted if necessary. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Is there any point in already thinking about an expansion? The only important thing is to emphasise our readiness and our resolve to act if necessary. At the moment, that would be premature, but the risks in the world economy have grown significantly. We have had to lower our economic forecasts, and we simply want to be ready to act if the circumstances so demand. Were you too optimistic with your economic forecasts in the spring? We were accused of that, but I don’t think so. The downward adjustment in September was not large and was mainly due to the correction in the emerging markets. The economic recovery in the euro area itself is intact. On Thursday, the US Federal Reserve System decided not to raise interest rates. Does this decision make life easier or more difficult for the ECB? The euro area is in a very different cyclical phase from the US economy. Therefore, our monetary policy cycles are also not synchronised. Nonetheless, we share the concerns about the prospects for the global economy. If we judged that shocks were sufficiently severe and persistent to weaken the inflation outlook for the euro area, we would not hesitate to act. How much of its growth potential did the euro area lose during the crisis? The potential had already weakened before the onset of the crisis, because productivity growth had slowed down. The crisis then made everything even worse, so today the euro area is on a much lower growth path. But monetary policy cannot change that. Monetary policy can only cushion the problem by, for example, making liquidity available and thereby helping to avoid a banking crisis. Monetary policy cannot create sustainable growth. For that, it is necessary to have intelligent structural reforms which strengthen the growth potential of the economy. However, that is not the task of the central bank, but of the governments. What should the latter do specifically? They must undertake structural reforms to lay the foundations for higher productivity and growth. Europe needs intelligent reforms. But these reforms seem to be taking a long time. You are being too pessimistic. We can see encouraging signs in the euro area, particularly in countries like Spain and Ireland, but also in Portugal. Italy was admittedly late in starting reforms, but is now on the right track. Are you also as confident about Greece? The situation in Greece is still difficult, but with the new programme we have made a step forwards. And will the new programme bring relief? The programme is indeed demanding, but we are convinced that the reforms will help Greece to create growth again and make its way out of the crisis. However, in view of the forthcoming elections, I do not wish to add anything further on that. Let us focus on Switzerland. It is clear that the policies of the ECB have a strong influence on a small, open economy like Switzerland. Is it still at all possible for the Swiss National Bank to pursue an independent monetary policy? There can be no doubt that every monetary policy also has an impact on other currency areas. However, the biggest impact on Switzerland does not come from the ECB, but from the policies of the euro area countries. The weak crisis management by politicians in the 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  euro area has led to investors seeking safe havens such as Switzerland, which has strongly pushed up the price of the Swiss franc. And has the expansionary policy of the ECB not played a role? I believe our policy has helped to allay fears, and has thus tended rather to reduce the flight to the Swiss franc. When the euro area does better, the Swiss franc is under less upward pressure. Are you not making it too easy for yourself? The ECB took responsibility in the crisis and thereby helped reduce uncertainty in the financial markets and even avoid panic. In doing so, it also took the pressure off currencies like the Swiss franc. Naturally, all of this would have been much more effective if European governments had also done better with their crisis management. But the ECB’s quantitative easing did also weaken the euro and thereby strengthen the Swiss franc? Bear in mind that the Swiss National Bank also introduced a kind of quantitative easing and expanded its balance sheet – long before we did, by the way. In spite of this policy, for a long time the inflation rate in Switzerland has been even lower than in the euro area. It is difficult for a central bank in such a situation to avoid the appreciation of its currency in the long term. Should there also be rules governing an orderly exit from the euro area? I believe that there is need for a crisis management system and a resolution mechanism for overindebted institutions, whether private or public. What will the euro area look like at the end of your period of office at the ECB? We will again have inflation rates below, but close to, 2%, because our policy will achieve its goal. And the banking union will be complete, meaning that the resolution regime and the deposit protection will be fully Europeanised. For me, this is a precondition for a well-functioning monetary union. In four years, Europe will be in a much healthier state than today. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stephen S Poloz: Riding the commodity cycle – resources and the Canadian economy Remarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to Calgary Economic Development, Calgary, Alberta, 21 September 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank Bahattin Buyuksahin, Brigitte Desroches, Kun Mo and Konrad Zmitrowicz for their help in preparing this speech. Introduction This isn’t the first time that a governor of the Bank of Canada has come to Calgary to talk about commodities. I suspect it won’t be the last. It’s an obvious discussion topic here in Alberta, where resources make up more than a quarter of the economy. Of course, such riches aren’t unique to Alberta. Natural resources have been a big economic story for this country since the time of European contact. Today, Canada is the only major exporter of natural resources among the G-7 nations. Oil is just one part of the story – we are also a major producer and exporter of coal and natural gas, base and precious metals, minerals such as potash, and agricultural and forest products. Because Canada has been endowed with such a wide variety of resources, we’ve had to learn how to deal with large swings in their prices. I don’t just mean the usual high degree of volatility common among many raw materials. I’m also referring to the long-term swings in prices that are often called “super cycles.” What’s important to remember is that these long-term swings are driven by the fundamental economic laws of supply and demand, as well as the continuous technological progress that can affect both output and consumption. The pattern is familiar. A large and persistent increase in demand leads to sustained upward pressure on resource prices over a number of years. The higher prices act as an incentive to boost supply, and companies act by, for example, investing in new capacity and finding methods to increase efficiency. While high prices can certainly spur research and development, technological progress has been a constant theme in natural resource industries. Such advances uncover ways to raise output and lower production costs. And it’s because of this progress that inflation-adjusted commodity prices have generally been trending lower for 200 years. The investments that lead to increased output can take years, if not decades, to complete. But, over time, the higher output generated by those investments combines with stabilizing demand to bring about a period of downward pressure on prices. Faced with lower prices, companies may scale back investment and production. Ultimately, the lower prices will encourage demand, and the reduced investment will crimp future supply, leading to higher prices. And producers will ride the price cycle all over again. Any economy that relies on natural resources will naturally be challenged by large movements in their prices. These shocks are more than just swings in national income; they also force businesses to make decisions about the way resources such as capital and labour are allocated. These decisions often lead to difficult adjustments, but they are necessary for maximizing our economy’s potential. While an abundance of raw materials may complicate the management of companies and the conduct of economic policy, it’s far better for a country to have resources than not to have them. Even when prices are falling, as they have been recently, our endowment represents a store of value and a source of future riches. What I’ll do in the rest of my time today is talk about some of the global forces that have been driving recent swings in commodity prices and look at how they may evolve in the years to 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  come. Then, to emphasize just how uncertain the outlook can be, I’ll talk about some alternative scenarios that could dramatically alter the future for producers. Finally, I’ll revisit some of the lessons that policy-makers and business leaders can apply today and in the future. Global forces at work Let’s take a look back at resource prices over the past 15 years or so. We saw a large and persistent increase in demand, sparked by rapid economic growth in emerging markets. In China, the world’s most populous country, economic growth averaged about 10 per cent annually between 2001 and 2011, a period that included the global financial crisis. Chinese growth has meant enormous demand and rising prices for many of Canada’s resources, particularly coal and oil, as well as base metals such as copper, nickel and aluminum. As millions of people in emerging markets left rural areas for cities, demand increased for building materials such as the iron ore used in steel, and this supported prices. Although the financial crisis led to price declines, many raw materials rebounded sharply. By April 2011, the Bank of Canada’s commodity price index had reached its post-crisis peak. However, rapid growth tends to moderate as an expansion matures. Chinese economic growth has eased to an average of 7.5 per cent since 2012, as authorities have tried to engineer a more sustainable and domestically oriented expansion. Similarly, India, which saw annual GDP growth near 9 per cent from 2005 to 2010, has also moderated since 2012. While it’s true that these cooling growth rates have had an impact on prices, we shouldn’t forget that emerging markets are still an important source of demand. Indeed, since the start of the decade, the Chinese economy, now the world’s second-largest, has more than doubled in size when measured in current dollars. In terms of supply, we’ve also seen responses that are putting downward pressure on prices for metals and some energy goods. For example, the iron ore supply continues to expand despite lower prices, thanks to the impact of multi-year investments made when prices were higher. These investments led to expanded capacity in low-cost areas such as Australia and Brazil. Now let me say a few words about oil prices. This topic is obviously of great importance here in Alberta because of its impact on employment and the overall economy. But it’s also important for Canada as a whole, given the implications for national income and interprovincial trade, as well as the industry’s sizable influence on business investment. Why did oil prices fall so much? The main reason is that supply rose sharply, thanks primarily to technological advances in oil extraction everywhere. This includes the oil sands, tight oil and the Bakken deposits. Consider in particular the technological progress that enabled producers to tap tight oil reserves. Output from the United States alone, which essentially didn’t exist before 2008, reached 4.2 million barrels per day last year. That increase is roughly equivalent to all the oil that Canada produces in a year. Given the dramatic drop in prices over the past year, the Bank has spent a lot of time speaking with business leaders to try to gauge precisely how they will react. At the start of the year, oil companies were saying that they intended to cut investment by about 30 per cent. Prices didn’t recover as much as was forecast at the time, so companies subsequently told us that they would cut their investment intentions by about 40 per cent. Currently, based on discussions I’ve had over the past couple of weeks, many firms are still revising their longer-term expectations for oil prices. The Bank will continue to assess what the impact may be on their investment spending. What this means for the evolution of oil prices is very hard to say. The Bank’s usual practice is to assume for our projection that oil prices will remain stable and use our economic models to test alternative scenarios. I know many companies do the same. But that can be risky: 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  because the vast majority of oil transactions are financial, rather than between producers and users, prices tend to be more volatile than the underlying fundamentals. Before I move on, let me emphasize a point. Lower prices for base metals and oil today do not mean that long-term investments, which may take years to complete and last for decades, were somehow a mistake. Without those investments, we would never have been able to capitalize on the higher prices, which boosted Canada’s aggregate income. What matters for a given investment is how prices evolve over the life of the project, which is impossible to know when long-term investment decisions must be made. From the end of 2008 to the end of 2010, the price of copper tripled, while oil and nickel prices more than doubled. If you believe in market forces, these movements represented a clear signal to invest and expand output. Those who were able to recognize the opportunity, make adjustments and exploit the higher prices were rewarded, and the increased income brought important benefits to Canada’s economy. Alternative scenarios and the need for flexibility Now let me spend some time talking about the future. The price cycle I’ve sketched out may appear to be fairly predictable. But history has repeatedly shown that new technologies can quickly upend assumptions about future demand and supply. For example, back in the 1970s, there were predictions that the world would run out of copper by the end of the century. The people who made that forecast did not foresee that copper wire, long a staple of communications infrastructure, would be replaced by fibre-optic cable, with its glass threads made from silica. This technology helped reduce the demand for copper, in essence extending its supply. Similarly, digital photography had a dramatic impact on the photo-processing industry. Twenty years ago, the idea that everyone would carry around telephones that were also good-quality cameras was ridiculous. People took pictures with cameras that were loaded with film and took the film to a developer. The processing consumed a lot of silver. Back then, if you didn’t anticipate the emergence of digital photography, you might have expected this source of demand would continue indefinitely. Instead, according to the Washington-based Silver Institute, the use of silver in photography peaked in 1999 and has fallen by almost 80 per cent since. It’s these sorts of technological advances that make predictions about future demand and supply so difficult. But it’s also these technological advances, combined with Canada’s many gifts of natural resources, that will generate the opportunities to secure our future prosperity. Our goods will remain in demand; we will continue to have lumber for houses, metals for industrial production and oil for use in plastics – and it’s hard to imagine that Canadian roads won’t continue to need new asphalt repairs. Further, it’s important to remember that Canada’s endowment is extremely diverse. While the cycles for base metals and oil have turned lower, there is still substantial demand that’s supporting the prices of many agricultural goods. As I noted, with continued growth in emerging markets, their populations are becoming increasingly urbanized. In North America, 82 per cent of the population lives in urban areas. That compares with 55 per cent in China, and just 30 per cent in other emerging markets such as India. This trend toward urbanization is likely to continue. With it will come growing demand for goods linked to household consumption – particularly agricultural products. Consider the hundreds of millions of people who are climbing the income scale in India and China. Their changing diet implies much more than just stronger demand for traditional protein sources. It also implies demand for inputs such as fertilizer, animal feed, fish feed, oilseeds and specialty crops such as lentils and chickpeas. Indeed, the latest traffic figures from Port Metro Vancouver show sharp growth in shipments of wheat and specialty crops, and solid gains in meat, poultry and potash. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Canada is particularly well placed to tap growing demand for fish and other seafood. Canadian seafood exports to China in the first half of the year grew by 11 per cent compared with the same period last year. To take just one example, 60,000 lobsters are flown from Halifax to Shanghai every week, aided by advances in shipping and production technology. Thanks in part to this demand, lobster prices have been rising sharply. In terms of aquaculture, however, there appears to be considerable growth potential. While mussel farming output grew by about 35 per cent from 2009 to 2013, farmed salmon production plateaued over that period at about 100,000 tonnes a year. Canada has more coastline than any other country in the world. Yet the volume of our seafood output is dwarfed by countries such as Norway, which produces seven times as much as Canada does. I’ll leave it to others to figure out how best to tap this potential resource. Rare earth minerals, the 17 elements used in high-tech products such as cell phones and hybrid vehicles, represent another potential source of growth for Canadians over time. It’s impossible to know with certainty where opportunities will emerge 30 years from now. What new technological advances lie just over the horizon? Consider, for example, the future of water desalination. Right now, the process of removing salt from sea water is too energy-intensive to be economically feasible on a large scale. But perhaps we are just one technological breakthrough away from solving this problem. Imagine the impact if the chronic droughts plaguing western North America and Australia could be eased by desalinated ocean water. The point of this exercise is to emphasize just how uncertain the future is. Businesses, consumers, governments – we must all plan for the future based on the best information we have. At the same time, natural uncertainty requires us to be flexible to adapt to circumstances that can change rapidly. In concrete terms, this means business leaders must be aware of the risks involved in resource production, manage those risks as best as they can, and be ready to react to market signals and seize opportunities. History has shown that the companies that are nimble are the ones that are best poised to thrive over time. Policy-makers can help in these efforts by encouraging economic flexibility. This means allowing the necessary adjustments to take place and not frustrating flows of investment or labour from one region to another. Canada’s labour market showed impressive flexibility when oil prices were rising, as workers flocked to Alberta to fill demand. And, in our latest Business Outlook Survey, the Bank saw evidence of labour shortages easing in regions where some interprovincial workers are returning from the oil patch. Policy lessons Before I conclude, let me say a few words about how monetary policy fits into the picture. There are lessons that we can take from previous price cycles. The most important of these is the value of our monetary policy framework. We can’t do much about resource price shocks. But our policy can help the economy adjust to them. In particular, our floating exchange rate helps absorb some of the impact of the price movements and sends signals that facilitate adjustments. Think back to the previous decade. From 2002 to 2012, oil prices went from about US$25 per barrel to more than US$100 per barrel, leading to a jump in our national income. Over the same period, the Canadian dollar appreciated from a record low of around 62 cents U.S. to above parity, helping to reduce the inflationary risks that came with the stronger growth and increased income. Similarly, over the past year, both oil prices and the Canadian dollar have fallen sharply. The floating currency is helping to reduce the disinflationary risks that have come with the cut in our national income. Further, allowing the currency to float frees the Bank of Canada to concentrate our single policy tool on our single target, which is inflation. If we tried to offset 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  these currency movements, we would end up frustrating the natural shifts in economic resources. By focusing on our mandate to keep inflation low, stable and predictable, the Bank has built up credibility, and Canadians have well-anchored inflation expectations, even in the face of large price swings. For example, when we have seen big moves in energy costs, such as the price of gasoline, there has been little evidence that consumers began to adjust their overall inflation expectations, either upward or downward. Why is this important? Since Canadians see our commitment to our target as credible, that makes it much easier for us to reach our mandated goal without needing big swings in output or interest rates. Those of you who can recall our experience with the oil price shock of the 1970s will remember the subsequent effort required to bring inflation under control. Without a credible target and with unanchored expectations, inflation soared. Extremely high interest rates were needed to get price increases back under control. Another point to remember is that swings in commodity prices can affect the normal relationship between the total inflation rate and the core measure of inflation that we use as an operational guide. For example, total inflation is currently being pushed down by the impact of lower energy costs. In contrast, core inflation, which strips out the most volatile inflation components, is facing upward pressure because recent declines in the exchange rate are boosting the prices of imported goods. However, we expect these to be one-off effects, and, as such, we would look through them. As we noted in our July Monetary Policy Report, when all the temporary factors are stripped out, the underlying trend in inflation in Canada is in the range of 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent, below our target of 2 per cent. Given these complications, the Bank is looking at how we measure core inflation as part of our regular review of our inflation-targeting regime. Next year, we will answer the question of whether the Bank should continue to focus on one pre-eminent measure of core inflation and, if so, whether our current core measure will remain in that role. In our interest rate announcement earlier this month, the Bank noted that the resource sector is continuing to adjust to lower prices, and that these complex adjustments will take considerable time. Our inflation-targeting regime will help facilitate these adjustments. Canada has seen this movie before – we’ve managed it well in the past, and I’m confident we will continue to manage it well in the future. Conclusion It’s time to conclude. As Albertans know well, it can be hard to ride the cycles in raw materials prices. But resource price fluctuations affect all countries, whether they are consumers or producers. Canada is fortunate to be both, and we shouldn’t ignore the resources that we have been blessed with. Natural resources bring opportunities. Over the years, Canadians have used our endowment to build a prosperous economy. We will continue to do so. And rather than resist market forces, Canadians should heed the signals sent by price movements. We’ve adjusted to rising prices; we can adjust to falling ones. These adjustments are never easy. They are often difficult and painful for affected individuals and their families. But they are necessary. For our part, the Bank of Canada will continue to promote low, stable and predictable inflation. Doing so is the best contribution we can make to helping promote both strong, steady economic growth and the flexibility needed to ease those adjustments and help our resource-rich country thrive. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jessica Chew Cheng Lian: Integrated risk management approach for maintaining resilience & sustainability Speech by Ms Jessica Chew Cheng Lian, Assistant Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the Business Continuity Management Conference “Integrated Risk Management Approach for Maintaining Resilience & Sustainability”, Kuala Lumpur, 15 September 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank the Disaster Recovery Institute, Malaysia and Sterling Risk Solutions for the invitation to speak at this Business Continuity Management (BCM) conference. Today, the ability of corporations to effectively manage risks has become a key factor that determines the agility and resilience of businesses. Business imperatives are changing so dramatically that risk management has become a more significant part of most organisations out of sheer necessity – largely driven by regulation, the desire to avoid costly sanctions, or to respond to increasing environmental and political risks. In leading organisations, the successful integration of risk management with strategic and commercial decision-making is creating important competitive advantages that are likely to be sustained over the longer term. This distinct organisational strength is one that cannot be easily replicated for the simple reason that building and maintaining a complete organisational response to strategic risk management, unlike say introducing a new product or marketing strategy, is not something that is accomplished within a short period of time. This morning, I would like to talk about some of the changes we are seeing in the practice of risk management and reflect on important priorities for risk management as observed from our work at Bank Negara Malaysia with the financial industry. I will then offer some brief perspectives on business continuity management and close with some final thoughts on the prospects for the insurance industry in Malaysia to contribute towards the advancement of risk management capabilities across Malaysian businesses. Changing practices in risk management Since the financial crisis, risk management practices have come under intense scrutiny. The spectacular failures in risk management in the lead up to the crisis prompted deep reflections on what had gone wrong with risk management systems and practices – not least of all among companies that had invested heavily in sophisticated risk measurement and management systems only to have them ultimately fail to detect or control risk exposures. Closer to home, businesses in Malaysia are currently facing a set of challenging business conditions and some are likely to find themselves ill-prepared to respond to the challenges, with important implications for their future prospects. So what can we learn about the changing practice of risk management from these experiences? A first observation to my mind concerns the importance of building a strong risk culture supported by governance arrangements that are explicitly aligned to a firm’s risk appetite. It is striking that, in the last five years, global standard setting bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have moved to address risk culture, risk appetite setting and risk governance more explicitly in regulatory standards. This was not the case prior to the crisis, when emphasis was predominantly placed on risk management processes and systems, believing that this ought to be sufficient. Organisations largely failed to take into account behavioural biases that play such an important role in senior management decisions which ultimately affect the risks that a company will be willing to take or tolerate. These decisions include how performance targets are set for staff, how incentive structures are designed, and the stature and resources that are provided to risk management functions within the organisation – all of which can create a constant uphill struggle for risk managers to have any meaningful impact on risk outcomes. To illustrate the point, a report published by 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the Office of Financial Research in the United States observed that much of the advancements in risk management over the last decade have resulted in a highly analytical-focused discipline, while largely ignoring the fundamental drivers of risk-taking that are rooted in more subtle behavioural characteristics. Within the financial industry, financial institutions in Malaysia are required to establish a well-resourced independent risk management function that reports directly to a board risk committee, and take active measures to promote a prudent risk culture in the organisation. This includes properly designed incentive structures that must reflect risk outcomes. Financial institutions are also required to regularly review their risk management methodologies and processes to account for the changing business environment. This aims to ensure that risk management does not become something one does to check off a box on a list and then forgets about. A second notable observation has been the broader focus of risk management. While financial risks remain a key focus of risk management practices, risks from reputational, human capital and environmental concerns can have equally significant repercussions for a firm’s business. Recovering from reputational damage is a hugely expensive endeavour, takes a long time, and success is often not assured. We have observed in our own work that where institutions take a broader view of risk management in these areas, conversations around the role of risk management at the senior management and board levels are more likely to shift beyond avoiding losses, to enhancing strategic opportunities for improving the institution’s competitive position. This itself can have a mutually reinforcing effect of directing more resources towards risk management and creating better synergies between business and risk functions. While more firms are acknowledging the importance of reputational, human capital and environmental risks, actions however have generally not measured up. Many companies still have weak succession plans in place and remain vulnerable to key-man risks. Few companies have robust risk management frameworks that incorporate measures of how their products and services affect the well-being of consumers or if consumers are being treated fairly, as long as legal exposures are contained. And efforts to adopt triple bottom line approaches to reporting firm performance are only beginning to gain traction. Within Asia, fewer than 10 banking institutions today subscribe to the Equator Principles for assessing and managing the environmental and social risks for projects. Clearly the gap between the existing risk management practices and a whole-of-business approach which fully embraces broader aspects of risks remains large. Regulation and greater shareholder activism will remain important drivers of change, and in my view, so will a new breed of risk managers who effectively integrate traditional and emerging risk perspectives, and who can speak to these perspectives in a compelling and cohesive way to an organisation’s key stakeholders. A third observation that I want to make today relates to the increasing importance of viewing risks over a longer-term horizon, and imagining the unthinkable. I mention these together for a reason. When one is focused on looking both backward and forward over a reasonably long horizon, the universe of what is unthinkable becomes smaller and our vision is less likely to be blinkered by limited experiences of only the most recent past. We are also likely to become more open to broader possibilities of new and emerging risks on the horizon. In the world of creative arts, it is often said that we are limited only by our imagination. I think the same can be said of risk management. If we can stretch our imaginations a little further, then there is a higher chance that risk management will be more proactive in anticipating future problems, especially problems that we may have never encountered before. This requires risk managers to go beyond estimating the probability of risk events occurring, and allowing a greater role for uncertainties, no matter how remote, to feature more prominently in risk management approaches. While easier said than done, innovations like reverse stress testing and the increasing degree of internal and external collaboration that goes into 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  constructing stress testing scenarios are positive indications of how firms are responding to this challenge. On this score at least, risk management is increasingly proving to be more of an art than an exact science. Organisations also continue to face significant challenges in efforts to break down risk silos and achieve an integrated view of organisational risks that adequately takes into account operational dependencies and common exposures that can significantly amplify risk outcomes. A key challenge often overlooked is the failure to effectively integrate human resource management strategies with enterprise-wide risk management goals. This can create significant inertia, with organisations often falling back to managing risks in silos as the default position. Successful organisations have recognised that silos are fundamentally a cultural phenomenon. If we can build and nurture people within an organisation to be always attuned to risks that may affect the organisation, whatever their nature or origins, then there is a good chance that any system, process and framework constraints will be more easily overcome and less likely to inflict major losses on the organisation. When faced with challenging business and financial conditions and a highly dynamic environment, it is always more important to have excellent people than excellent models. BCM as part of enterprise risk management This brings me to the more specific area of business continuity management, or BCM. A paper published in 2008 by the Chartered Management Institute of the United Kingdom found that 76 percent of the survey respondents reported that business continuity management is seen as important in their organisations but only less than half revealed that they have specific business continuity plans. There are several reasons for this which I will not get into here, but a major one is the lack of metrics to measure success in the absence of a major institutional crisis. One commentator put it this way – the return on investment is simply that business stays open. Two contrasting examples of BCM help to underscore this point. Investigations by the Japanese Government into the Fukushima tsunami disaster revealed material inadequacies in the handling of complex risks associated with managing a nuclear power plant. This was demonstrated in poorly executed emergency procedures in evacuating residents during the incident. Consequently, the operations of the power plant were suspended. In contrast, during the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre, a sustained commitment by a large multinational financial service provider to strengthen its BCM and continuously improve its evacuation procedures over almost a decade, enabled it to reduce the time taken to evacuate its employees from four hours to 45 minutes, saving thousands of lives. Within the financial sector, a key focus of reforms since the global financial crisis has been on the development of recovery plans which aim to protect the continuity of critical functions and core business lines in a situation of financial stress. Work has also been initiated to implement this in Malaysia. Financial institutions are expected to develop a menu of options for recovering from events of severe stress in order to restore business to a stable condition. These plans must be regularly updated to reflect changes in a firm’s business model and operational arrangements. At its most basic level, recovery plans are helping financial institutions to better understand their operational and financial interdependencies and how this can affect recovery options that are available to the institution. Some institutions are finding through this process that their operations have become far too complex to support credible recovery strategies. These institutions are taking or considering steps to restructure parts of the business to achieve wider options for recovery. Indeed, an important development emerging in the recent period has been the more explicit consideration of implications for recovery plans in key strategic decisions, such as decisions to hub operations at a particular location or service provider. As much as organisational resources are put into enhancements of business continuity management, it is important for businesses to always keep in mind the inherent limitations of 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  business continuity plans and not be lulled into a false sense of confidence that these plans may provide. Scenarios featured in these plans are often based on assumptions, which are a simplification of reality at best. Such scenarios should always be rigorously challenged to account for changing conditions. Business recovery or resumption actions should also contemplate a range of conditions to build agility within the organisation to execute required, but potentially untested, responses. Firms should expect that they will rarely get to a point of precision in their scenario planning and BCM responses. This does not mean that BCM is necessarily reduced to an exercise in futility. A commitment to continuous improvements in BCM is almost certainly likely to prepare firms better for disasters and tail risk events even if those specific events were not exactly contemplated. This is because the organisation will be naturally better at coming together in a crisis, and would be able to leverage on some of the core elements of response plans that have already been developed and tested. The world today is encountering more extreme disasters such as epidemics and unpredictable weather-related calamities. In our own country, the worst flood disaster experienced in decades last year saw over 250 thousand people displaced with estimated costs of more than two billion ringgit to repair damaged infrastructure. This presents a sober reminder of the responsibility of all corporations to ensure that they are well prepared for and remain resilient against calamities, not just for their own survival, but in the interest of employees and the community that depend on them. Role and prospects of the insurance industry in advancing risk management The cost associated with negative tail-risk events will only escalate as business networks grow in complexity. The use of insurance continues to be an important way in which companies can reduce this cost by transferring risks to insurance providers. Insurers are well-placed to assume such risks given their long standing history in risk analytics which enables them to effectively exploit the law of large numbers and benefit from risk pooling. Among emerging economies, however, there is still a sizeable protection gap in spite of the increased frequency and severity of weather related disasters and other natural catastrophes. In 2014, insured losses in Asia only covered about 10 percent of total losses incurred as a result of natural and man-made disasters. Combined insurance premiums written from emerging markets accounted for only 18 percent of global premiums in 2014, against 82 percent recorded from the advanced economies. Given the concentration of growth and development in emerging economies, going forward, the extent of under-insurance is a concern. In many of these economies, efforts are being aggressively pursued to increase awareness of the importance of insurance protection in helping one manage risks, and to develop an effective insurance market to meet these needs. The insurance industry in Malaysia currently stands at crossroads of implementing important reforms being introduced by Bank Negara Malaysia both in the general and life insurance sectors. The objective of the reforms is to further enhance the competitiveness of the industry, ensure its continued resilience, and encourage greater innovation in solutions offered for households and businesses to better manage risks. To this end, two aspects of the reforms are significant. The first is the progressive strengthening of prudential standards that aim to improve underwriting and risk assessment capabilities within insurance companies, while substantially strengthening incentives for insurers to differentiate themselves in the market. The second is the structural changes that are being introduced to reduce market distortions and drive efficiency improvements. Beyond domestic borders, the Bank also continues to pursue further liberalisation in the cross border provision of insurance in certain sectors, such as the Marine, Aviation and Goods in International Transit (MAT) sector, both to enhance capacity and reduce costs for businesses. This is primarily being advanced under regional integration plans, focusing in particular on ASEAN. Taken together, the reforms are expected to result in wider product offerings and delivery channels, service quality improvements, greater market transparency, and more differentiated pricing that is reflective of risk. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  This will help risk managers for whom the decision to purchase insurance is increasingly driven by wider considerations which go beyond just the intention to transfer risk. Significant advancements in risk management practices and financial innovations have substantially broadened the actions that risk managers can take to control risks. For many companies, insurance solutions are no longer viewed as the only, or even the most important, way to reduce risk exposures. The insurance reforms will allow the industry to better respond to changing demand drivers. Importantly, it will also create opportunities to build stronger partnerships between corporate risk managers, insurance companies and insurance brokers in elevating risk management practices more generally. This includes a wider role envisaged for the industry in providing risk advice to clients, and initiatives to advance the quality and coverage of risk information that is useful to risk managers across a broad spectrum of areas, such as information on hazard exposure, demographic changes and technological risks. Conclusion In conclusion, maintaining that delicate balance between extreme risk aversion and well-reasoned risk taking, which is essential for businesses to grow and prosper, will always involve difficult judgements. We should be careful to ensure that advancements in risk management practices are serving to sharpen, and not blunt, such judgements. This requires that investments in people and processes are firmly supported by good information, confidence in a strong risk culture, and compelling risk managers who will ensure that organisations do not become complacent, and remain focused on doing their very best to prepare for any possibility. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  S S Mundra: Financing India’s growth – challenges and way ahead Keynote address by Mr S S Mundra, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at a Summit on “Financing India’s Growth – Way forward”, organised by PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI), New Delhi, 9 September 2015. *      *      * Shri Yaduvendra Mathur, Chairman & Managing Director, Export Import Bank of India; Shri Sunil Srivastava, Dy Managing Director, State Bank of India; Shri Alok Shriram, President , PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI); Shri Sanjeev Gupta, Chairman, Banking Committee, PHDCCI; delegates to the Summit; members of the print and electronic media; ladies and gentlemen! I am grateful to the PHD Chamber for inviting me to deliver the keynote address on a very important theme “Financing India’s Growth- Way forward”. I am happy to note the efforts being made by the PHD Chamber for promotion of industry, trade and entrepreneurship through its research-based policy advocacy role. The Summit today, I feel, is an important step in that journey. I also understand that the PHD Chamber and CRISIL have combined to prepare a knowledge report highlighting key issues essential for financing India’s growth and I compliment them for their efforts. I trust that the recommendations made therein would positively impact the economic growth and development of the country. 2. In my address today, I intend to talk about India’s growth potential, suitable model for India’s growth, key challenges that undermine the achievement of the potential growth rate and the way forward in overcoming these challenges. Let me; however, begin with an overview of the global economic situation and where India stands at present. Global overview 3. The global economy is presently dominated by four themes- the Chinese slowdown, the impending rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, the large-scale slump in global commodity prices, especially oil and the continued sluggishness in the economic recovery. Looking at the Advanced Economies (AEs), growth is virtually stagnant in Japan at 0.8% while the Continental Europe is slated to report only marginally higher growth at 1.5% during 2015. The recovery in North America, including in the USA is modest and UK is likely to witness a modest 2.4% growth during 2015. 4. The emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) have also been witnessing significant slowdown in growth. China’s growth rate is likely to fall to 6.8% from 7.4%, while that for Russia (–3.4% from 0.6%) and Brazil (–1.5% from 0.1%) are set to go into negative territory in view of recessionary pressures. Of the other BRICS nations, South Africa is estimated to grow higher at 2.1% up from 1.5%. Against this backdrop of negative to modest positive growth rates for the large economic powerhouses and major EMDEs, India’s economy is poised to grow at 7.6% with potential for even higher growth rates. The outlook for growth in India is improving gradually. The business confidence remains strong and as the initiatives taken by the Union Government begin to find traction, it is expected that private investment and consumer sentiment would revive. We in RBI firmly believe that moderate inflation is essential to ensure and sustain a higher trajectory of growth. That brings us to the question “what is our growth potential?” India’s growth potential 5. This question has been a subject of active debate in the academic and policy research circles. Literatures / research papers have put varying estimates of the country’s potential growth rate notwithstanding the methodological issues surrounding the estimation of potential output, leading to considerable uncertainty. There is, however, a fair degree of 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  unanimity that the Indian economy is currently growing below its potential and closing this negative output gap (i.e., actual growth minus potential growth) has to be a priority. 6. What is holding India back in attaining its potential higher growth rate? Since the conference theme is “Financing India’s growth – Way Forward”, I would like to start with a basic question: Is availability of finance constraining growth? Financial sector is meant to sub-serve the needs of the real economy and cannot drive growth by itself. We have seen the pitfalls of the financial economy racing ahead of the real economy in the form of the Global Financial Crisis. I would argue that availability of finance, so far, has been a much smaller problem and it is more on account of structural problems that the rate of growth has not achieved its potential levels. It is contextual to mention here that as per World Bank’s “Doing Business 2015” report, while as a country we languished at 142nd rank amongst 189 countries in the overall ranking; on the parameter of ease of “Getting Credit”, we faired comparatively much better at 36th position. 7. As we deliberate on ways of financing India’s growth, let me place some pertinent points for further reflections and begin with talking about what should be our growth model. What kind of growth do we want? 8. The growth model that we should pursue has also been a subject of great debate amongst the policy makers. Should it be a manufacturing driven, export-led growth, should it be infrastructure led growth or one driven by domestic consumption? In fact, all models have their respective pluses and minuses. We have the examples of current Chinese meltdown and the Asian Financial Crisis of late 90s which, in part, resulted from heavy investment in infrastructure creation which ceases to provide positive returns beyond a point or too much reliance on export-led growth. Perhaps, we might want an equitable mix of all – growth led by increase in domestic consumption, investment in infrastructure and manufacturing. I believe we are well past a period when we could focus exclusively on being a world manufacturing hub for driving growth. To my mind, we would do well to aspire for a growth model which predominantly focuses at domestic manufacturing and global service delivery, which would be much more sustainable. It is also essential to realize that growth can be sustainable only if it is inclusive in nature and outlook. The inter se disparities or skewness in development between regions, communities etc., is neither desirable nor good for the society. Key challenges to growth 9. Having discussed about the potential growth rate for India and the model of growth that we would like to pursue, let me highlight some key challenges to achievement of the potential growth rate. Although there are also certain socio-political reasons for slower growth, from an economic stand point, I feel following are some of the major challenges: • Lack of investment in infrastructure- both physical and financial • High level of Financial Exclusion • Skill gap, which has implications for employability • Decline in Gross Capital Formation & dwindling domestic savings rate What needs to be done? 10. Government as well as RBI have been mindful of these challenges and have been taking steps to overcome them in a sustainable manner. It is also worth emphasizing here that there needs to be a fine balance struck between promoting investment in “capital intensive” and “labour intensive” companies, whether in industry or in service segments. This is necessary keeping in view the sheer number of educated workforce in the country. Over a period of time we have witnessed contribution of the service sector go up significantly to 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  around 57 % of the GDP. The recent growth in output in the services sector can largely be attributed to rapid development of skill intensive services like Information Technology (IT) and IT enabled Services (ITeS) sectors, e-commerce and professional service segments, mostly oriented towards the external market. There are questions raised about the quality and sustainability of this service-sector growth as also its potential for future growth. However, I believe that the Government’s thrust on digital India and skill development will continue to support expansion of both: modern services like e-commerce, communication and finance as also more traditional services like trade, transport and storage, etc. Urban migration 11. A crucial piece of the growth continuum would emerge from continued migration of people to urban areas. This would fuel demand for housing, transportation, electricity, education, healthcare facilities, etc. Governments/ Municipal bodies would also need to invest in creation of roads, sewage systems, water supply facilities, etc. While focus on impending urbanization is critical, the rural economy should continue to remain an area of focus as more than 60% people would continue to live in rural areas. Focus on rural economy and financial inclusion 12. Income levels in the rural areas could be improved through land reforms like consolidation of fragmented landholdings, which in turn can support modern harvesting methods, and training the rural people for undertaking non-farm activities. Efforts to enhance the credit absorption capacity must be supplemented through financial literacy, vocational training initiatives and an efficient crop insurance framework. 13. RBI has for long been focused on inclusive growth through policies like selective credit control, priority sector lending norms, lending to weaker sections of the society, service area approach and through the financial inclusion drive in recent past; details of which are well too known to this audience. RBI’s policies on expansion of branch network in rural and semi-urban centers have also been part of this initiative. There is a need now to leverage upon these efforts to channelize savings and deploy them for productive asset creation. The two newly licensed full-service banks, eleven payment banks and soon to be licensed small finance banks, would provide further impetus to accessibility of finance and render the credit intermediation process more efficient, thereby contributing to a sustainable and inclusive growth. Focus on SME financing – a key driver for future 14. While on the subject of inclusive growth, it is pertinent to talk about the MSME sector, which has the potential to foster strong growth by creating local demand and driving consumption. Presently, MSMEs contribute nearly 8 per cent of the country’s GDP, 45 per cent of the manufacturing output and 40 per cent of the exports. They provide the largest share of employment after agriculture and are nurseries for entrepreneurship and innovation. Acknowledging the importance of the sector to economic growth, both- Government of India as well as RBI have been taking measures to enhance flow of credit to the sector. On its part, RBI has launched several initiatives in this regard. To specifically address the issue of delayed payments to the MSME sector, TReDS has been conceptualised as an authorised electronic platform to facilitate discounting of invoices/bills of exchange of MSMEs. On the other hand, as part of capacity building of MSME divisions in banks and to develop entrepreneurial sensitivity, RBI has recently launched targeted training programmes for the functionaries in commercial banks. Government of India has also recently laid out a framework for revival and rehabilitation of MSM enterprises. The other initiatives of Government of India i.e. “Make in India”, “Skill India Mission” and “Digital India” also ties in neatly to provide further push to the sector. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Role of banks in financing growth 15. Traditionally, like other emerging markets, Indian economy has been bank-dominated. So whether it is for project development, or working capital needs of the corporates, banks have been the primary source of credit. Though primarily banks are supposed to undertake maturity and liquidity transformations, there are limitations on the extent of asset-liability mismatches they can run on their books. The large scale distress being witnessed in banks’ infrastructure portfolio also raises issues about their ability to critically appraise such projects. The typical role for the banks in mature markets is to originate loans and then distribute to other willing players in the market. They predominantly undertake working capital finance and provide structured financial solutions to their clients. They also act as market makers for various financial sector products. With the gradual widening and deepening of our financial markets, it would be fair to expect our banks to also gradually shift their focus to SME and retail clients while leaving the long-term resource contribution to other players including pension funds/ insurance companies which have long-duration liabilities on their balance sheets. 16. There is another factor relevant in this context. While the banks’ ability to dispense credit depends upon their capital position, they are also guided by the viability of the projects to be funded. Risk aversion stemming from stress in financial assets has been one of the reasons for restrained bank credit growth in recent times. Have borrowers been meeting their obligations? 17. I have raised the issue of borrowers’ obligations on many occasions and at the cost of repeating myself, I would like to emphasise the point once more. While the quest to grow is understandable, the borrowers cannot exclusively rely on bank funds to finance this growth, without committing their own funds. The labyrinthine maze through which several large infrastructure projects have been funded point to extremely low or negligible levels of equity contributions leading to extremely high levels of leverage and virtually no skin in the game for the promoters. There is a very visible pattern here. The last few years’ growth was largely on account of Infra projects. These projects were launched by a handful of promoters with thin equity as I alluded to earlier. I suspect that this small group has run out of even such thin level of equity to contribute their fair share for revival of the stalled projects, not to talk about commissioning of new projects. So, it should be obvious to everyone that if momentum has to continue then they have to either find fresh equity on their own or make way for others who can contribute such equity both for the existing projects and also for new ones. 18. It is also pertinent to mention here that the present legal system does not facilitate an easy closure/takeover of unviable firms. In order to overcome such problems and to salvage value in firms in distress, it is imperative to take measures for an early enactment of a Bankruptcy Code. Creation of a central authority for resolution of financial firms in distress also needs an early finalization. 19. High levels of debt accumulation by corporates has been encouraged in part by the availability of low-cost, abundant and flexible debt, facilitated by the search-for-yield environment created by the extraordinary policy measures undertaken in the US, UK, euro area and Japan. Several corporates have increased leverage, by borrowing in both foreign and domestic currencies. As corporates, you have to be mindful of global uncertainty, which is a given. The interconnectedness of markets lends itself to volatility. The entities with significantly higher unhedged forex borrowings are most likely to face maximum distress. Governance reforms 20. India would continue to need external capital for growth and hence, we must create conducive environment for boosting investor confidence, which includes stable, efficient and 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  predictable legal, taxation and audit framework along with credible credit rating regimes, amongst others. Conclusion 21. I shall conclude by reiterating a few points I made earlier. Persistently weak economic conditions in the global and domestic markets have perhaps been the single most important reason for moderate growth in recent times rather than availability of finance for productive purposes. Going forward also, availability of finance should not be a constraint considering India’s attractiveness as a major investment destination for global investor community. However, the path to a potentially higher and sustainable growth is essentially through higher savings and infrastructure investment, which needs to be ably supported by an environment of macroeconomic and financial stability. It is essential, therefore, to sustain the momentum of gradual economic reforms which I alluded to earlier. Both, RBI and the Government would have to collectively work towards creating the necessary enablers for growth like moderate inflation, stable exchange rate, fiscal consolidation, predictable legal/taxation and auditing regime. Early resolution of the impasse on land acquisition, enactment of GST and bankruptcy code would also provide strong leg up to investment climate in the country and drive up growth. Strengthening the pace of financial inclusion and financial literacy, more efficient and better-directed public spending, particularly on the social sector (education and health) and skill-development would be equally significant steps towards this goal. Thank you! 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Vítor Constâncio: Interview with Thomson Reuters Interview with Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, and Thomson Reuters, conducted by Mr Paul Ingrassia, Mr Balazs Koranyi and Mr John O’Donnell on 14 September 2015. *      *      * Is quantitative easing working? It is working and effective in many ways. The ultimate metric to assess success is the inflation rate normalization around our medium term target. That is achieved through the improvement of financial conditions in general, by the effect of our policies on expectations, the cost of capital, and rebalancing of portfolios. All of those channels have been working. Since last year, the lending rates of banks have gone down by more than 70 basis points and in several more vulnerable or periphery countries, like in Italy and Spain, more than 100 basis points, whereas our main policy rate has gone down only by 20 basis points. For the first time since 2009, in our survey with SMEs, the number of firms reporting that access to credit has improved was higher than firms saying the opposite. After years of negative growth rates, credit to the private sector is now growing at an annualized rate of 2 percent. So, all of these are good indications that our policy is improving financial conditions. Still, you’re contemplating a change in the asset purchase programme. What would be the triggers for such a change? We said in January that we were aiming at achieving a sustained path of inflation towards our objective and we are far from that objective right now. We want to achieve that sustained path. We thought it was relevant to remind everyone that we said from the beginning that we would keep the policy until we achieve our goals. Many people say there’s not a whole lot you can still do. How would you respond to them? We said at the last press conference that the size, composition and duration of our present large scale asset purchase programme can be changed. The total amount that we have purchased represents 5.3 percent of the GDP of the euro area, whereas what the Fed has done represents almost 25 percent of the U.S. GDP, what the Bank of Japan has done represents 64 percent of the Japanese GDP and what the U.K. has done 21 percent of the UK’s GDP. So we are very far from what the major central banks have done using these instruments. But this is not a benchmark, I mentioned that as an illustration. There is scope, if the necessity is there. If the price of oil does not continue to go down (it cannot go down indefinitely), we will see a jump in inflation in the last quarter of this year. But we may have before that some months of negative inflation. Until now we have not seen a reason to doubt that the programme will work. The staff projections are recent, predicated on the completion of the whole programme and foresee inflation at 1.7% by 2017. But we are prepared for any contingency. What can monetary policy do for growth and potential growth? Monetary policy affects growth via financial conditions, which affect expenditure decisions, investment and the aggregate demand. What is more difficult for monetary policy is to affect potential growth. That depends very much on the growth of labour supply, technological progress, increasing productivity, organization of production. That’s the supply side. The effects of monetary policy on that are very indirect. Europe has a big problem of low potential 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  growth. It starts with demography: the working population is decreasing, so productivity has to be increased even more to compensate for it. Potential growth is very low and in present conditions, we fear that this will be a protracted period of low growth. This prospect of protracted low growth is shared by all advanced economies. So Europe has to do more in terms of supply side reforms, investment, productivity growth to get out of this situation. Is embracing immigration important for Europe? In general yes. But there are two dimensions to this: one is the medium to long term issue of immigration and demographic developments, and the other is the short term crisis of refugees that raises a lot of logistical issues, among others. To me, it’s clear that immigration is one of the things that can improve the demographic potential of Europe, which is necessary, if Europeans think and care about the welfare of future generations. The size of the working age population of the euro area is declining 0.6 percent a year until the 2030s. That’s huge. To change the demographic trends, promoting birth is not enough, is also has to be done through immigration, if this is to be corrected. If not, we’re creating a great difficulty to growth and to the welfare of future generations. This is a very acute problem because for years Europe has been doing the sort of collective demographic suicide and no one is thinking about this. In the short term, the backlash against immigration has been dramatic. It’s because the unemployment rate in Europe is a very high 11 percent, which is destabilizing the continent. In human and social terms, the costs are enormous and the reactions we see to immigration stem from that. It is very important to reduce unemployment and slack in the economy. Fortunately, in the present situation, the price stability objective and the engineering of growth go hand in hand. Does slow wage growth present a challenge for the euro zone? Countries have been adjusting. Now several of those countries are growing. There are other countries in the core of the euro zone where one could see that wages could grow more. Wages have been subdued in spite of the recovery. This will end if the recovery continues and that will help later inflation rates to normalize. What is the outlook for the global economy and China? The situation is uncertain. There are three sources of uncertainty. One is the strength of the recovery in the U.S. We need a strong recovery in the U.S. Another one is China. We need that China will be able to stabilize the situation and keep growing. Then we have the uncertainty of what will be the reaction of emerging markets to the normalization of interest rates in the U.S. If the recovery in the U.S. is stronger than it looks right now, that will be the more important thing for the world economy. China can still stabilize its situation and to keep growth above 6 percent is achievable in the short term. The more uncertain situation is in emerging markets. We don’t know what will be the impact of interest rate normalization on the corporate bond market in those countries. Are we witnessing a structural shift in the global economy? China and other countries could not continue to grow forever at 9 or 10 percent a year. Growth in those countries was bound to decelerate. It is not a structural shift. The potential for growth in emerging markets is still there. What is more difficult to envisage is an acceleration of growth in advanced economies to the level we were used to before the crisis. We are facing this sort of configuration for quite some time. This does not mean that unemployment would continue to increase because we may have enough growth to push 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  down unemployment to more healthy levels. There is growth (1.5% in euro area, 2.5% in US) and this can accelerate, depending on the international environment. But we will not see the same sort of potential growth as before for a while. Could Europe experience what Japan has experienced? I don’t think so. The development in wages will be always different from Japan. There is more rigidity in wages in a recession (in Europe) and that is an important factor and that is why I never really feared we would have actual deflation in Europe. Wages will not be as flexible down as they were in Japan. Most of euro area GDP comes from services and inflation in services is basically about wage developments. It is very difficult to go to a situation of deflation in Europe. That’s a difference with Japan. Will divergence continue in the euro zone? No. We saw an initial phase of catching up and convergence. Then came the crisis. If you look to the development of the economy in the U.S. and Europe, the recoveries are very similar until 2011. Then Europe had a double dip because of the recessionary adjustment. After painful adjustment and many reforms, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia and Cyprus grew faster than the euro area average in the first half of this year. The only exception is Italy which is growing slightly less than the average. We have growth again. We need to strengthen the confidence in peripheral countries. That has to be achieved by deepening integration. The Greek turmoil raised doubts. These doubts have to be now closed by additional institutional reforms. What doubts were raised about the euro? It raised doubts for the markets that countries like Greece could cope with the challenges of monetary union. There was never any doubt among the majority of member countries. We maintain that the euro is irreversible. Legally, no country can be expelled. The actual prospect of that happening was never for real. Do you fear that some people in Europe may lose faith in its institutions? At the ECB, we are doing the utmost within our mandate. We are aware that there are excessive expectations about what central banks can do. Unemployment is destabilizing the continent. European values are being eroded in several countries as a result of the fear that unemployment creates. It is for other policy makers to do their job. Does a change in the stance of the Federal Reserve have implications and has market volatility become a permanent feature? We don’t know what the reaction of markets will be. Monetary policy is not about fine tuning volatility in financial markets. We have medium term objectives and that helps to stabilize expectations. Central banks should be independent from financial markets and not follow all their fluctuations. Excessive volatility is not good because it is a sign of uncertainty. There is a new situation now. Market liquidity, the facility to buy and sell without affecting prices too much, is reduced after the crisis. Market makers have reduced their inventories. Business seems to be less profitable. Regulatory reforms made liquidity a bit less cheap. Markets are adjusting to this situation and that can lead to volatility. Are capital controls compatible with monetary union? They are temporary. The situation in Greece after the agreement on the programme, has stabilized. We would expect the new government will show strong ownership of the 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  programme. The situation of liquidity of the banking sector has improved in Greece after the agreement was reached. The stage is set for a gradual dismantling of the capital controls. They will be eliminated as they were in Cyprus. Are you confident the IMF will join a bailout for Greece? The IMF has endorsed the policies that were included in the memorandum. To join a new programme, the IMF has two conditions: one about debt sustainability and the other on ownership of the programme by the Greek authorities. Regarding the debt sustainability analysis, the discussions will take place at the time of the first review. You have seen various analyses showing that you cannot just consider the debt sustainability analysis in terms of debt ratios. A big part of the Greek debt is under concessional terms for quite a period of time. Everyone expects convergence of analysis will be possible. A haircut has been refused by the member states and I certainly hope it will not be necessary in view of the numbers. The more one digs into the numbers, the more that sort of conclusion seems to emerge. That’s a matter for the negotiations. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  R Gandhi: Asset reconstruction and NPA management in India Keynote address by Mr R Gandhi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the “The Economic Times ReModel in India – Asset Reconstruction & NPA Management Summit”, Mumbai, 15 September 2015. *      *      * Assistance provided by Shri A K Choudhary, Smt. Chandana Dasgupta and Shri B. Nethaji is gratefully acknowledged. Ladies and Gentlemen, Very Good Morning. 2. It is indeed a pleasure to be present here and interact with you on the important issue of management of non-performing assets in India. Such events are quite important especially when there is a surge in stressed assets in banking in the recent times. Current Position 3. However, if we look a little far back, the asset quality of the Indian banking system was not like this; it had actually been improving significantly since the implementation of reforms in the banking sector and introduction of prudential norms, enactment of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002, Credit Information Companies Act, etc. The gross NPAs ratio steadily declined from 15.7 per cent in 1996–97 to 2.36 percent in 2010–11. However, the amount of non-performing assets witnessed spurt subsequently and as on March 2015, it was at 4.62 per cent of the gross advances of the banks in comparison with 2.36 per cent of the gross advances as at March 2011. The growth in NPAs was much higher than the growth in advances during the last four years. In addition, the ratio of restructured standard assets to gross advances grew to 6.44 per cent as at the end of March 2015 from 5.87 per cent of gross advances as on March 2014. The total stressed assets (i.e., NPAs plus Restructured Assets) as on March 2015 were 11.06 per cent of gross advances.    4. The sharp increase in stressed assets has adversely impacted the profitability of the banks. The annual return on assets has come down from 1.09 per cent during 2010–11 to 0.78 per cent during 2014–15. Considering the effect it has on both capital and liquidity position of the bank, there is an urgent need for banks to reduce their stressed assets and clean up their balance sheets lest they become a drag on the economy. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches    5. Managing asset quality is always very important and becomes a prominent objective especially during a period of economic downturn. Recognising the importance of effective asset quality management, Reserve Bank has issued various guidelines to banks, from time to time, on various aspects of asset quality management. Preventive Management 6. Reserve Bank has advised banks that the management of credit risk should receive the top management’s attention and the process should encompass: a) Measurement of risk through credit rating / scoring; b) Quantifying the risk through estimating expected loan losses and unexpected loan losses c) Risk pricing on a scientific basis; and d) Controlling the risk through effective Loan Review Mechanism and portfolio management. 7. Further, Reserve Bank has also advised the banks to put in place a robust credit risk management system which is sensitive and responsive to various factors affecting credit risk. The guidelines entail involvement of top Management, including the Board of Directors of the bank in actively managing the credit risk of the banks. Banks are required to put in place proactive credit risk management practices like annual / half-yearly industry studies and individual obligor reviews, credit audit which entails periodic credit calls that are documented, periodic visits of plant and business site, and at least quarterly management reviews of troubled exposures / weak credits. Recent regulatory initiatives 8. Recently, In January 2014, the Reserve Bank of India had released a comprehensive “Framework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the Economy”. The Framework outlines a corrective action plan that will incentivise early identification of problem cases, timely restructuring of accounts which are considered to be viable, and taking prompt steps by banks for recovery or sale of unviable accounts. In addition, to address the issue of information asymmetry as also to identify the problem early, a Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) to collect, store, and disseminate credit data to lenders, was set up. Under this arrangement, banks are reporting credit information, including classification of an account as SMA to CRILC on all their borrowers having aggregate fund-based and non-fund based exposure of ₹50 million and above with them. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  9. While having a proper credit risk management is very important for managing asset quality, another issue which is equally important is proper structuring of the credit facilities extended to various borrowers. While granting credit facilities, banks should set realistic repayment schedules on the basis of a proper analysis of cash flows of the borrowers. This would go a long way to facilitate prompt repayment by the borrowers and thus improve the record of recovery in advances. A “one size fits all” approach and providing plain vanilla loans to all clients may not be in the interest of banks as well as its customers. 10. In order to effect a structural change in the way project loans are granted by banks, and considering the need to facilitate banks to offer long term project financing, which may ensure long term viability of infrastructure and core industries sector projects by smoothening the cash flow stress in initial years of such projects, Reserve Bank has issued guidelines on flexible structuring of long term project loans with periodic refinancing option. Reserve Bank has also introduced the concept of “standby credit facility” to fund cost overruns in projects. Such “standby credit facilities” are sanctioned at the time of initial financial closure; but disbursed only when there is a cost overrun. At the time of initial credit assessment of borrowers / project itself, such cost overruns are assessed, agreed to be disbursed in the eventuality of cost over runs, and the Debt Equity Ratio, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, Fixed Asset Coverage Ratio, etc. are determined accordingly. Thus, there may not be any need for the borrower to approach the banks at a later stage for additional finance. Restructure / rehabilitation 11. However, despite proper credit appraisal and proper structuring of loans, slippages in the asset quality may not be unavoidable, especially when the economic cycles turn worse. Hence, once a weak account is identified, banks need to consider various remedial actions. One of the remedial options is restructuring. In spite of their best efforts and intentions, sometimes borrowers find themselves in financial difficulty because of factors beyond their control and also due to certain internal reasons. For the revival of the viable entities as well as for the safety of the money lent by the banks, timely support through restructuring in genuine cases is called for. The objective of restructuring is to preserve the economic value of viable entities that are affected by certain internal and external factors and minimize the losses to the creditors and other stakeholders. 12. Such support to borrowers who are in temporary financial difficulties need not be contingent upon retention of asset classification status as “standard”. There is a tendency among banks to withdraw their support once an account is classified as NPA. Mere classification of an account as non-performing asset need not result in withdrawal of support to viable borrowal accounts. The purpose of asset classification and provisioning is to present a true picture of bank’s balance sheet and not to stigmatize accounts / borrowers. However, while considering their support to accounts under stress, banks should make proper distinction between willful – defaulters / non-cooperative / unscrupulous borrowers on the one hand, and on the other hand, borrowers defaulting on their debt obligations due to circumstances beyond their control. 13. As you may be aware, Reserve Bank has withdrawn special asset classification benefits available to restructuring of assets with effect from April 1, 2015 to align our norms on restructuring with international best practices. Subsequent to that there is a sudden drop in the assets being “restructured” and it seems that banks have become very choosy in restructuring loans to borrowers who are under stress. One of the reasons cited for drop in restructuring of assets is that “banks have no incentive in restructuring”. We feel that decision of the banks in restructuring should be driven by their motivation to revive an account which is under temporary financial difficulties and preservation of the economic value of viable entities in the interest of both the creditors and borrowers, rather than merely concentrating on asset classification and provisioning benefits. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Recovery / exit 14. As a first step towards effective recovery / exit framework from accounts which are beyond revival, banks should have a well -defined loan recovery policy which sets down the manner of recovery of dues depending upon the circumstances of each account. Banks may resort to either opt for legal avenues or non-legal avenues for exiting the account. Banks may enter into compromise settlements in terms of their Board approved policy for compromise settlement of NPAs. However, adequate care should be taken to ensure that the compromise settlements are done in a fair and transparent manner. Banks may also sell their NPAs to other banks (which happens outside the SARFAESI Act). There are a few banks which have better recovery expertise and we have seen instances of them purchasing NPAs from other banks. 15. In the event of failure of the above mentioned measures, banks could resort to filing suits with Debt Recovery Tribunals or invoke the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. An alternate option to enforcement of security interest is that of selling the NPAs to securitisation companies / reconstruction companies (SCs / RCs) registered under the SARFAESI Act. SCs / RCs are expected to do a specialized task of recovering and reconstructing the NPAs thereby reducing the NPAs in the system. The purpose of creation of SCs / RCs was to resolve NPAs of banking system by using their expertise. Asset reconstruction companies 16. As on date 15 SCs / RCs are registered with Reserve Bank. Sale of NPAs to SCs / RCs which was relatively sporadic has picked up substantially during the last two financial years.     17. However, only a few of them appear to be successful in acquiring assets from banks. Of 15 registered SCs / RCs, asset size in respect of top three SCs / RCs (viz., ARCIL, “JM Financial” and “Edelweiss”) account for more than two thirds of total assets of all SCs / RCs. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  18. An analysis of purchase of NPAs by SCs / RCs indicate that acquisition cost as a percentage to book value of assets increased sharply from 20.8 per cent as on March 2013 to 44.5 per cent as on March 2015. In other words, the discount rate at which SCs / RCs are acquiring NPAs from the banks / FIs decreased considerably, possibly on account of (i) developing of improved NPA recovery methods by banks (ii) selling of relatively fresh NPAs (iii) outsourcing the valuation of NPAs (iv) presence of competition among SCs / RCs while auctioning NPAs. 19. On the recovery side, the performance is not very encouraging. As on March 31, 2015, the average recovery rate (assets resolved as a % to assets acquired) of SCs / RCs was at 31.0 per cent. One of the reasons for a dip in the average recovery rate is due to the fact that substantial part of the assets under management of SCs / RCs is acquired recently. Further, a wide variation in recovery rates among SCs / RCs is also observed for the same reason. 20. An analysis of investor class in security receipts (SRs) does not depict any divergence. It is observed that seller banks / FIs have been subscribing majority of SRs. On an average seller banks / FIs have been subscribing 74 per cent of total SRs issued during the period March 2010 to March 2015. In past two years, seller banks subscribed around 80 per cent of total SRs.      21. The aggregate asset size of SCs / RCs witnessed sharp growth of 64.8 per cent during 2014–15 on top of 21.3 per cent growth witnessed in the previous year. In numerical terms, aggregate asset size of SCs / RCs stood at ₹ 6920 crore as on March 31, 2015. The reported average Return on Assets of SCs / RCs was at 3.48 per cent while the average Return on Equity stood at 4.48 per cent during the period March 2010 to March 2014. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches    22. RBI has recently taken various steps to improve the system’s ability to deal with distressed assets of banks and financial institutions. Reserve Bank has issued various guidelines relating to the operations of SCs / RCs as also to make transactions between them and banks more transparent. These guidelines were further strengthened with floors on transaction prices and prevention of collusions with promoters in buy back deals. The modified guidelines mandated SCs / RCs to have an increased skin in the game by making it compulsory for them to invest and hold minimum 15% (as against 5% hitherto) of the security receipts issued by them. 23. In order to promote the business of asset reconstruction in India, foreign direct investment cap on SCs / RCs has been increased from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route. While foreign institutional investors have also been allowed to participate in the equity of the SCs / RCs, the maximum shareholding by FIIs cannot exceed 10% of the paid up capital of the SC / RC. With a view to facilitate debt consolidation, SCs / RCs are now permitted to acquire debt from other SCs / RCs. SCs / RCs have also been permitted to convert a portion of the debt into shares of the borrower company as a measure of asset reconstruction. Consent threshold for security enforcement actions has been brought down to 60 per cent of the amount outstanding to a borrower as against 75 per cent hitherto. SCs / RCs with acquired assets in excess of ₹ 500 crore can float a fund under a scheme and utilize upto 25% of funds raised from the qualified institutional buyers for restructuring of financial assets acquired. Promoters of the defaulting company / borrowers or guarantors are allowed to buy back their assets from the SCs / RCs subject to certain conditions that are helpful in the resolution process and minimization of cost. Guidelines on Uniform Accounting Standards for SCs / RCs has been issued for reckoning Acquisition cost, Revenue Recognition, Valuation of SRs, etc. to induce transparency in the books of SCs / RCs. Norms for calculation of management fee has also been rationalised. Management fee will now have to be based on the net asset value of the SRs rather than the outstanding SRs issued 24. With these regulatory changes, SCs / RCs will need to focus on actual redeeming of security receipts as it is no longer possible for them to base their profit model on the basis of management fees. In the near term, SCs / RCs may find it difficult to align their pricing to the expectations of the selling banks and the selling banks also may not have yet reconciled to a realistic sale price expectation for the assets that they want to offload, resulting in the reduction in sales. The rationale behind these regulatory changes was to incentivise the process of recoveries / restructuring, as net asset values of SRs is calculated on the basis of the likely rate of recovery of stressed assets. 25. The RBI has also advised that the banks using auction process for sale of NPAs to ARCs should be more transparent, including disclosure of the Reserve Price specifying 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  clauses for non-acceptance of bids, etc. If a bid received is above the Reserve Price and also fulfils the other conditions specified, acceptance of that bid would be mandatory. 26. It is expected that these amendments to the regulations will improve recovery prospect for SCs / RCs. Membership of JLF, lower threshold for consent to enforce the SARFAESI Act, more time set to conduct due diligence and greater disclosures will enhance transparency and lead to better resolution of NPAs. It would also result in lower vintage of NPAs being sold by banks and quicker debt aggregation. NPA Management – New Thoughts 27. Let me now share with you some of the thoughts we have been discussing on NPA management. Enhancing Credit Appraisal Capacity 28. One of the fundamental issues that hampers NPA Management is the inadequacies in the credit appraisal capacity of banks, more specifically on project appraisal. As we know, there is just one technical consultancy firm, besides some specific desks in some banks. With the requirement of independent evaluation for JLFs and the number of JLFs, there is a crying need for emergence of additional technical capabilities to undertake evaluation of projects, restructuring schemes, etc. Banks will have to strengthen their in-house desks as well. Reserve Bank through the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning has taken initiative to organise capacity building program for bankers. Number of members in a consortium 29. Another suggestion that has come relates to limiting the number of banks and financial institutions that should be permitted in a consortium or even in a multiple banking arrangement. It is said that the banks with very meagre share neither have incentives nor inclination to independently assess the proposal and they typically and blindly go by one that has bigger share. Even if the bank has in-house technical capabilities, with a small share its voice is not strong enough. Therefore, the suggestion is to have a regulatory limit on the number of members in a consortium or multiple banking arrangements so that every member has at least 10% of the exposure and therefore will have serious independent credit appraisal and credit monitoring. There are counter views about this suggestion, especially with regard to the freedom to be available for a bank or borrower to take the commercial decision on a loan. Ready list of management and technical experts / specialists 30. Yet another suggestion is to prepare a ready list of management and technical experts and specialists whose services can be availed by banks, financial institutions or the asset reconstruction companies whenever the JLFs decide to change the management under a CAP. Perhaps IBA can prepare and update such a ready list. 31. All these suggestions need further exploration and discussion before we take a final view. Issues faced by SCs / RCs Capital 32. There is no denying the fact that SCs / RCs need capital and that too on continuing basis to be able to grow and be meaningful players in the sector while avenues of raising capital is limited. The networth of 15 ARCs is only around ₹4000 crore whereas stressed assets in the system run into lakhs of crore. The industry being a capital intensive one, SCs / RCs are struggling to raise capital. Deep-pocket investors are interested in the 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  business but cautious on account of slow pace of judicial and administrative environment. While there is limited appetite among the existing sponsors and shareholders, the limit of 50 percent on individual shareholding and the stipulation that the sponsor should not have any controlling interest in the SCs / RCs (as stipulated by the SARFAESI Act) are proving to be stumbling blocks in this regard. However, it needs to be mentioned here that it would not be an easy option for SCs / RCs to raise funds through IPO for the reason that while on the one hand, there is an apparent lack of investor appetite in the domestic market in the distressed space, the performance of SCs / RCs has, so far, remained dismal for a variety of reasons and this may prove to be a road block. SCs / RCs that can raise capital in a timely manner will be better positioned to play an active role in the field. SCs / RCs need to explore more in this regard especially through FDI route. There has also been a demand from the industry that subordinated debts like loans from the sponsors should be designated as Tier II capital and should be taken into account while calculating the capital adequacy of the SCs / RCs. Pricing of NPAs 33. The other important issue is pricing of NPAs. Currently there is no meeting point between price expectation of sellers and bid price by SCs / RCs, which is also evident from the low success rate of auctions. This also proves to be a hindrance while bringing in more investors willing to invest in the SRs being issued by the SCs / RCs to raise funds for acquisition of NPAs. Investors in stressed asset portfolios expect high returns, based on high-risk, high-reward principle which SCs / RCs find impossible to offer if the assets being acquired are not realistically priced. Equilibrium in offer and bid prices is essential for revival of the NPA market. This issue is best resolved by market forces and participants. Indian Banks Association in consultation with Association of Asset Reconstruction Companies may draw contours of mutually acceptable methodology for reserve price valuation. Discovery of fair price for NPAs may definitely help in more deals going through auctions and also generate interest from secondary investors like distress asset funds which can participate via SCs / RCs. Need of secondary market for SRs 34. In the absence of third party investor money which is an automatic fall-out of a virtually non-existent secondary market, the bank that sells NPAs doubles up as investor in SRs. A meaningful solution would have been to delink investment in security receipts from only a select group of qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) (as mandated under the SARFAESI Act) and throwing it open for all institutional players in debt trading. Further, as pointed out by the SCs / RCs, in terms of Guidelines issued by SEBI, High Networth Individuals (HNIs) are already allowed to participate in the SR market as Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) have been notified as QIBs, eligible for investment in SRs issued by SCs / RCs. One possibility is that they may be allowed to participate directly in the SR market, as they have necessary risk capital and risk appetite. This measure may help widen investor base and infuse greater depth to the secondary market for SRs. An active secondary market for SRs will attract special situations funds and QIBs to this market. Reserve Bank has already suggested to the Government of India that Section 7 of the SARFAESI Act may be amended by giving power to RBI to specify the category of the investors from time to time in consultation with SEBI. Debt Aggregation 35. While sale of NPAs by banks depend on various factors like security package available, best price, etc., and therefore many times sale with respect to debt of a single borrower to a single SCs / RCs may not be possible, sale of entire debt of one borrower to single SC / RC would help in effective and efficient resolution. Piece meal sale of an asset particularly with turn around potential by different lenders defeats the purpose itself as it results not only in delays but also pricing hiccups and derails resolution process. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Alternatively, SCs / RCs may also need to evolve mechanism to coordinate in successful resolution of those assets, in the best interest of all stake holders. Judicial delays 36. An important factor affecting recovery performance of SCs / RCs is the delay in judicial process: be it under SARFAESI Act or at the level of debt recovery tribunals. A fast and efficient judicial system is a sine qua non for effective resolution of NPAs. Realising the importance of having a strong bankruptcy framework in improving the ease of doing business, Government of India has constituted a Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee to study the corporate bankruptcy legal framework in India. The Committee has submitted an Interim Report in February 2015 for immediate action and its Final Report is expected to be submitted within 12 months, recommending a Bankruptcy Code. Reserve Bank expects that recommendations of the Committee, when implemented, would result in significant improvement in the bankruptcy framework of the country and enable banks / SCs / RCs to resolve their stressed assets in an effective manner. Conclusion 37. I am sure that with the efforts of the Government in bringing in a strong bankruptcy framework and various regulatory initiatives being taken by the Reserve Bank of India, the effectiveness of the SCs / RCs would improve to a great extent. At the same time, I hope that the market participants iron out the frictions which are best resolved among themselves, without looking for regulatory solutions to such issues. 38. I find that you have a technical session on regulatory limitations on unlocking the potentials of NPAs, solutions for managing NPAs and even preventive measures. I wish the event a great success and will look forward to receive your considered suggestions and comments. 39. Thank you very much for your patient attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ravi Menon: Asia – short-term bumps along long-term growth path Remarks by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the opening of Korea’s National Pension Service Office, Singapore, 17 September 2015. *      *      * Dr Choi Kwang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, National Pension Service Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon I am delighted to join you to celebrate the opening of the Singapore office of Korea’s National Pension Service (NPS). This is an exciting development for Singapore’s asset management industry. • NPS manages one of the largest pension funds in the world, with KRW 500 trillion of assets under management. The decision by NPS to set up an office here is significant. • This will be NPS’s first overseas office in Asia and its third in the world after New York and London. In setting up an overseas office in Asia, NPS is affirming the long-term growth prospects for the region. NPS is clearly taking a strategic view of Asia against the backdrop of recent market volatility and moderation in growth. Asia’s recent tantrum: what does it mean? Financial markets, including those in Asia, have experienced a surge in volatility over the past several weeks. • Equity markets have taken a beating. The stock indices in Emerging Asia are down by an average of 18% since their highs in Q2 this year, with the Chinese stock market correcting the most, by about 40%.1 • Currency markets saw sharp movements. The depreciation of the RMB, alongside a pullback of foreign funds from the region, triggered downward pressures on the region’s currencies. Since the RMB move on 11 August, Emerging Asia currencies have depreciated by an average of 3.2% against the US Dollar, with some falling by as much as 7%.2 While markets seem to have calmed somewhat, a sense of uncertainty prevails and the risk of renewed volatility remains. What is happening? Financial markets are essentially coming to terms with four significant “re-pricings”. • First, the stock markets in China are adjusting downwards from unsustainably high levels. • Second, the RMB has become de-coupled from the US Dollar and is moving towards a more market-determined exchange rate. • Third, oil and commodity prices have eased considerably this year, marking the end of what some have called a “super-cycle”.                                                 1  Emerging Asia economies refer to China, India, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. 2  Excluding the Hong Kong Dollar. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • Fourth, the effects of an impending interest rate hike in the US – the first after seven years of extremely easy monetary policy – are being priced in across Asian markets. These are not necessarily unwelcome developments. The correction in China’s stock market is not surprising given the stretched valuations that had developed over the preceding year. And it serves to deflate some of the excesses that have built up in the system, such as the rapid rise in margin financing. The 2.5% depreciation of the RMB against the US Dollar since August is consistent with the divergence in growth momentum between China and the US. It must also be seen in the context of the 15% appreciation of the RMB in real effective terms during the year to July. The move towards a more market-determined exchange rate is in line with the broader liberalisation and internationalisation of the currency. The gradual tightening of financial conditions in Emerging Asia as interest rates normalise in the US will serve to rein in the excessive credit expansion seen in some of the regional economies in recent years. It is not a bad thing to break the psychology of monetary over-dependence on the part of markets and even some policymakers. Talk of currency wars is over-blown and comparisons with the Asian Financial Crisis are over-done. To be sure, some of the gyrations in financial markets have reflected concerns among investors about the moderation of growth in Asia. • The sluggish recovery in the G3 economies has taken the wind from many trade-oriented Asian economies. • At the same time, the transition to domestic-led growth has been bumpy. Structural reforms to raise human capital, spur new investments and reduce impediments to growth have not proceeded quickly enough in many countries. So, downside risks remain, and there may be further bumps along Asia’s growth trajectory. But Asia is still expected to grow faster than other emerging economies. • In China, debt overhang and excess capacity will be a drag. But sustained monetary and fiscal stimulus measures should help to pre-empt a sharp slippage in economic activity. • In the ASEAN countries, a slowdown in export growth will have a negative impact. But public infrastructure spending and private consumption on the back of higher real incomes due to the decline in oil prices should help to shore up growth. • Overall, growth in Emerging Asia is likely to stay above 6% in 2015, not too far below last year’s 6.6%. Looking beyond this adjustment period, the medium- to longer-term outlook for Asia continues to be bright. Ultimately, economic fundamentals matter the most, and the longer-term drivers of growth in the region remain positive. • First, demographics across much of the region remain favourable, with the proportion of the working age population continuing to rise in most Asian economies. • Second, the emergence of a sizeable middle class and ongoing urbanisation will underpin a continued expansion in domestic consumption and investment. And Asia has the potential to do even better, if it continues to press ahead with deeper regional integration and domestic structural reforms. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Diversification for enhanced returns The significance of Asia’s growth and its implications for long-term investment returns are not lost to global asset managers. The increasing interest in the region is also motivated by the need at many pension funds and sovereign funds to achieve more diversified investment portfolios. • These funds are increasingly diversifying their portfolio allocations across geographies and reducing the home bias towards investment in domestic markets. • They are also diversifying across assets to include more non-traditional assets such as real estate, private equity and infrastructure, which promise sustained and attractive risk-adjusted returns. Emerging Asia offers both asset and geographical diversification. • Emerging Asia will remain one of the fastest growing regions in the world offering prospects of higher long-term returns, while the depth and liquidity of its asset markets should continue to improve. • The growth dynamics of Emerging Asian economies is not only different from that of developed Europe and America but also differentiated from one another. • Emerging Asia offers great potential for the development of alternative investment assets such as infrastructure, for which the region has enormous need. I congratulate NPS on the opening of its Singapore office and wish you continued success in your regional strategy. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Salvatore Rossi: Monetary policy in a low growth, low interest rate environment Speech by Mr Salvatore Rossi, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the “Roundtable on Monetary Policy in a Low Growth, Low Interest Rate Environment”, Istanbul Finance Summit, Istanbul, 8 September 2015. *      *      * The role of interest rates – short- or long-term, nominal or real – is pervasive in modern economies. Changes in interest rates affect: the value of wealth accumulated by savers, their propensity to save, the financing cost for borrowers, the evaluation of investment projects, the sustainability of fiscal debt, the stance of monetary policy. And the list could go on. We know that in many advanced economies, short- and long-term nominal interest rates are at historically low levels. And they have been very low for several years by now. This environment should not be viewed merely as a consequence of the central banks’ reaction to the global financial crisis; in a longer time perspective, it is also the end point of a trend. Some data: since the early 1990s the 10-year nominal yields on Government bonds have declined by 10 percentage points in the UK, 9 in the euro area, 6 in the US and Japan; short-term nominal interest rates have followed a similar pattern though with a larger volatility. How come? What are the associated risks and policy changes? In trying to answer these questions let me first recall that the nominal interest rate can be viewed as the sum of three components: 1) the real interest rate, 2) the expected inflation, and 3) a term premium. Economic theory tells us that the real interest rate is the price that equates the supply of savings with the demand for funds aimed at financing investment. Supply and demand, in turn, are determined by factors such the preference of households to smooth consumption across time and the productivity of capital. The expected inflation and the term premium components of the nominal interest rate are self-explaining: when buying a long term bond I want a return that could compensate me for the potential loss in my future purchasing power, and for the risk of a potential capital loss if I needed to sell the bond prior to maturity. A lot of influencing factors are involved here: expectations about future economic growth and inflation; the degree of risk aversion; financial markets volatility, domestically and abroad, since capital markets have become globally integrated. Which of these factors can explain the current low interest rate environment? I would indicate two sets of factors: transitory, and structural. The latter are particularly important, since they may suggest that the current environment is a long-run phenomenon, bound to stay with us for quite some time. The transitory factors are evident: first of all the expansionary monetary policy stance put in place by many central banks in response to the global financial crisis, and, in the euro area, also to the sovereign debt crisis. We know that most central banks in the advanced countries, as policy rates were reaching the zero lower bound, have enriched their monetary policy toolbox with various unconventional measures, the most important and visible one being programs of securities purchases (QE). Another transitory factor is the de-leveraging by the private sector. In part this is due to a financial regulation becoming much stricter than before the crisis. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  And here comes the structural factors. They can be summarized as follows: an excess of desired saving over desired investment, leading to lower economic growth and real interest rates. This is essentially the secular stagnation hypothesis proposed last year by Larry Summers.1 Barry Eichengreen, one of the most prominent economic historians of our times, has recently written an illuminating article on this topic.2. He discusses four possible explanations. 1)  High savings rates in emerging-market economies. This is the well-known global savings glut hypothesis put forward years ago by Ben Bernanke.3. The idea is that in some emerging countries, China in particular, social protection systems are so limited and weak that households feel forced to increase their precautionary saving. 2)  The decline in the relative price of investment goods (machinery, equipment, ICTs), thanks to technological progress. For a given investment project, a fall in the relative price of investment reduces the demand for funds. With less investment spending chasing the same savings, the result can be a lower real interest rates and, potentially, a chronic excess of desired saving over desired investment. 3)  A lower rate of population growth, in the advanced economies and now also in some emerging markets. It is reflected in a slower growth of the labor force, in turn requiring less investment. 4)  The fourth possible explanation is the more controversial one. The idea is that the pace of scientific and technological inventions has slowed down, since the golden XX century of electricity and ICTs, and will never recover, causing a corresponding permanent scarcity of high-return investment opportunities. Robert Gordon is a supporter of such a pessimistic view.4 Personally, I don’t believe in this fourth factor: the innovative capabilities of humankind have always caught philosophers and economists by surprise. But the other three factors are serious and deserve to be addressed. Let me now briefly touch upon some policy implications. Nearly eight years after the onset of the financial crisis, global growth is disappointing on average, but with a high variance across countries and regions. The U.S. recovery is continuing at a sustained pace, while growth in the euro area and Japan is currently still modest, though expected to pick up. Emerging economies’ growth will decline for the fifth year in a row in 2015, although these economies will continue to increase their share of global GDP. Against this outlook, monetary policy stance across major economies may become asynchronous in the coming months, when the Federal Reserve will actually start the announced normalization process. The big question is: how much transitory are the transitory factors explaining the current low interest rate environment? What will happen when monetary policy normalizes? Or will the structural factors prevail and keep real and nominal interest rates low forever, or at least for a very long time?                                                 1  Summers, H. L.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  On the first point, Reinhart and Rogoff,5 among others, have shown that in the aftermath of financial crises economic recessions tend to be more severe than in typical business cycle recessions and the recovery takes longer. Credit cycles last longer than business cycles. But eventually they come to an end, once households’ and corporates’ balance sheets have been repaired. And that poses the problem of how and when normalizing monetary policy. On the second point, a challenge relates to possible spillover effects on emerging-market economies of changes in the monetary policy stance in advanced countries. Large capital flows went to emerging-market economies in the last years, in search for yield, putting upward pressure on asset prices and exchange rates in those economies. They might suddenly reverse when monetary conditions change in advanced economies. The risk is that the process becomes disorderly, with impaired liquidity in certain markets or asset classes, rapidly diffusing contagion to other correlated asset classes. These risks call for clear and effective communication strategies by central banks, while the authorities in emerging economies should further strengthen policy buffers and further advance structural reforms. Another delicate policy challenge regards the relation between monetary and fiscal policies. The combination of high public debt – accumulated in many advanced economies in response to the financial crisis – and very low interest rates has strengthened the interdependencies between the two policies. Exceptionally low nominal interest rates have contained debt servicing costs, and that’s good news; the flip side is that fiscal positions are highly exposed to changes in the monetary policy stance, especially if changes are abrupt. Finally, what if the current low interest rates were the new long-run equilibrium? In this case I would see serious challenges for monetary policy management. Central banks might more often encounter the zero lower bound on nominal rates, which would imply less room to maneuver the policy rate to counteract deflationary shocks. The economy would be less resilient to negative shocks. Central banks might have to increasingly resort to what we call unconventional policies. But we do not know how effective these tools are as a normal business cycle stabilizer, and what macroeconomic risks they might entail. Let me conclude signaling another risk. Economic policies became exceptionally accommodative after the financial crisis in order to save the world from another Great Depression. Financial panic was destroying households’ and corporates’ confidence and curtailing aggregate demand, so macroeconomic policies, both fiscal and monetary, had to fill the gap, as long as needed. The phase of very low nominal interest rates has been necessary, and still is necessary in many areas of the world including the euro area, in order to support growth, fight deflation risks and sustain employment. But low growth, and the ensuing low interest rates, risk feeding on themselves if allowed to linger for too long: households may eventually feel compelled to save more, because they see, for instance, their insurance policies and retirement schemes at risk of not being fully honored. At the same time, low growth implies low return from real investment, and this creates perverse incentives to search for yield taking risk on board; this may jeopardize financial stability. One main lesson comes from these considerations. The most effective and long-lasting solution to tackle the declining trend of real interest rates is to act forcefully and preemptively to support growth. Support remains necessary from the demand side; but in the longer run it must come from the supply side, by identifying and implementing those reforms that, encouraging investment, may boost productivity and support job creation. We need to prove Robert Gordon’s prophecy wrong. The consequent increase in potential economic growth would raise the real interest rate and push nominal interest rates into a safer territory.                                                 5  Reinhart, C.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: The low interest rate environment in the euro area Keynote speech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at a Pension Funds Conference, organised by the Netherlands Bank, Bussum, The Netherlands, 10 September 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank Jonathan Yiangou, John Hutchinson and Katri Mikkonen for their contributions to this speech. Ladies and gentlemen Thank you very much for inviting me to address this conference. Over the last year conditions in fixed income markets have been, by any standards, highly unusual. Policy interest rates in the euro area have fallen to close to 0% – and negative in case of our deposit facility – while we have seen the 10-year German government bond yield drop as low as 0.075%, with at one point up to about 36% of euro area euro-denominated government bonds in negative territory. And though interest rates have retraced some way back up since mid-April, they clearly remain at historical lows. For investors whose business models are centred around fixed income this is undoubtedly a very challenging environment. I am, of course, aware of the challenges the pension fund sector in particular is facing. What I would therefore like to focus on in my remarks today is the ensuing question: what are the conditions that will allow for rates to rise back to levels that, looking retrospectively, are considered “more normal”? My answer can be summarised as follows. Very low interest rates are not so much a choice of the central bank as a reflection of economic malaise in the global and euro area economy. Some of the drivers of that malaise are secular, which are more challenging for public policy to affect. But others are related to demand conditions that appear weak even when compared with a long-term potential growth rate that is already disappointingly low. Such persistent economic slack relative to potential can be reversed through targeted measures. That includes tackling the cyclical headwinds that are dragging on aggregate demand; facilitating the process of balance sheet repair; and removing the structural barriers to higher real growth prospects, which can itself reinvigorate demand through expectation and confidence channels. The role of monetary policy is mainly to provide countercyclical stabilisation while the economy goes through this transition. When the economy is weak, after all, disinflationary pressures increase, which we have to counter to deliver on our mandate. The monetary policy measures currently in place in the euro area follow from this: they were decided as a direct result of a euro area inflation rate well below comfortable levels and persistent weakness in the economy. And in meeting our objective, we support growth and inflation, which in turn creates the conditions for interest rates to “normalise” once more. Of course, the level that rates will return to in the future is dependent upon the degree to which the secular drivers, currently depressing rates, can be reversed. Challenges of the low interest rate environment Let me start, however, by briefly touching on the challenges the current situation poses for the pension fund sector, as well as for the insurance sector given its similar focus on fixed income assets and the prevalence of long-term liabilities. Large euro area insurers show quite reasonable profitability,1 albeit the aggregate picture masks substantial heterogeneity                                                 1  See ECB (2015), “Financial Stability Review”, May. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  across countries and types of business. Small and medium-sized, non-diversified life insurers with high policyholder guarantees are typically highly exposed to low yields and have found their business models more under pressure. For pension funds the impact of low interest rates is strongest on those maintaining defined benefit schemes. The challenges for the insurance sector were underscored by the mixed performance in the stress test undertaken in 2014 by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).2 While the top 30 European insurers all fulfilled the Solvency II requirements in the baseline scenario, 14% of participants – mainly small firms representing 3% of total assets in the sample – did not do so. The similar exercise currently being conducted by EIOPA for pension funds will provide valuable insights into the strengths and vulnerabilities of the sector in the current market environment, an issue for which, at present, data is relatively scarce. The challenges, however, are not limited to the sectoral level. How insurance companies and pension funds adjust to the low interest rate environment could also have wider implications. With total assets of over €9 trillion, the strategies they employ to cope with low investment returns could clearly have spillover effects both to financial markets and the broader economy. One dimension of adjustment that could be relevant here is related to reallocation of portfolios towards higher return assets. “Healthy risk-taking” – to borrow a famous expression coined by Ben Bernanke – is at the very heart of monetary transmission. When central banks lower short-term interest rates in normal times, financial entities respond by shifting their portfolio allocations in precisely the direction that is needed to advance the objectives of monetary policy: they reinforce their duration exposure and step up risk-taking in general. By doing so, they amplify the stimulus that central banks introduce by intervening in an otherwise narrow and relatively unimportant market segment – the overnight interbank market. It is via this transmission mechanism that monetary policy is effective at all in producing a generalised easing of financial conditions. But that said, the longer low rates persist, the more we have to be watchful that healthy diversification does not morph into under-appreciation of risk that may create fragilities down the road. This could impact a broad swathe of market participants given the importance of insurance and pension funds, in particular as providers of long-term funding. Data for large euro area insurers provide some evidence of re-risking via a gradual rotation of portfolios towards the bonds of vulnerable euro area countries and emerging markets, and a maturity extension, although there are no indications yet of excessive risk-taking. Another dimension of adjustment that could have broader effects is related to the possible changes in saving behaviour generated by stronger incentives for risk-shifting towards policyholders. While moving towards unit-linked and defined contribution policies might increase the resilience of insurance and pensions companies, it could increase uncertainty over future benefits and thus raise precautionary savings among several cohorts of people. Data suggest, however, that this dimension of the adjustment remains contained. Unit-linked insurance and defined contribution pensions still constitute below 20% of life insurance policies and pensions in the euro area, and the pace of growth remains slow. In addition, survey results by EIOPA indicate that insurers have adjusted largely by focusing on diversification into non-life and asset management businesses or lowering of the guaranteed rates on new policies.3                                                 2  EIOPA (2014). “EIOPA Insurance Stress Test 2014”, available at https://eiopa.europa.eu. 3  EIOPA (2014), “Low interest rate environment stock taking exercise 2014”, available at https://eiopa.europa.eu. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  A third potentially problematic dimension of adjustment is related to incentives to increase concentration to reduce costs, which can bring with it financial stability concerns. In Europe, a handful of large insurers – some part of financial conglomerates – already play a central role in the financial system, although their individual links to banks and to other market participants do not currently seem to be over-concentrated.4 The creation of ever larger champions, however, could change that picture. The work conducted under the Financial Stability Board on Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SIIs) is thus highly topical, and also important from the European perspective. Understanding low interest rates5 In this environment, I can appreciate why some in the industry may call for higher interest rates. After all, the simplest solution to the challenges facing the sector would seemingly be for interest rates to rise as quickly as possible. But it is important to understand why interest rates are so low. And a closer examination reveals that the underlying drivers are not so much central bank policies as global and euro area-specific economic factors, some of which are more secular in nature and others which are more associated with the legacy of the post-Lehman financial crisis. To comprehend this point, it is useful to decompose long-term nominal yields into four components: expected inflation over the term of the asset; the expected path of short-term real rates; the inflation risk premium and real term premium, which together represent the compensation required by investors for holding long-term bonds as opposed to rolling over short-term securities. All these components have contributed to the very low long-term rates we observe today. From a long-term perspective, nominal yields on long-term bonds have been on a declining trend in all major advanced economies since the 1980s. Improvements in monetary policy frameworks have played a role in this: the commitment to low and stable inflation, and the adoption of explicitly quantified price stability objectives (or targets) by an increasing number of central banks, have brought down long-term inflation expectations and compressed inflation premia, both of which have contributed to lower nominal yields. But the decline in nominal long-term rates is also explained by the real component: the expected real rate as well as the real term premium. Part of this decline in real interest rates can be accounted for by long run, secular forces; the other part is due to more cyclical dynamics. If one takes the textbook Solow growth model as an organising device for the different forces driving real interest rates in the long run, they ultimately pertain to productivity and population growth, and savings behaviour. The intuition is that these forces determine investment and therefore the demand for loanable funds, which have to be matched by savings. Seen over the long-term, the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) has been slowing in the euro area for decades. Population growth has also declined from about 0.7% in the early 1970s to around 0.3% in recent years. And looking into the very distant future, the downward pull from adverse demographics could accelerate: some model-based simulations suggest that demographic trends – notably a rising supply of funds provided by an ageing population – could result in a significant reduction in the real rate in the long-run.6                                                 4  Alves, I., J.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  On top of the gravitational pull of these secular forces, there are cyclical factors weighing on real interest rates that are more directly linked with the global financial crisis. Notably, the euro area is still working its way through a “balance sheet recession”, where a situation of severe debt overhang sets the conditions for a sharp downturn, which in turn creates the need for substantial deleveraging and prolongs the length of the slump. This is the product of a pre-crisis period where, misreading the signs of declining productivity growth, firms, households and in some cases governments accumulated excessive debt on the basis of overly optimistic real income expectations. The result has been excess savings in the post-crisis period caused by the need for all three sectors to repair their balance sheets, while over-indebted firms and households in some countries have been confronted with higher credit premia, further depressing investment. Investment indeed remains well below pre-crisis levels. The damage caused to the economy by these dynamics has been massive. Youth and long-term unemployment has risen significantly in the euro area, with “hysteresis” effects estimated to have notably reduced labour supply. This feeds back into a slower potential growth rate, and potentially for some time, given the strong sectoral dimension to the crisis and the need for extensive re-skilling and reallocation of workers. Slower potential growth has also coupled with heightened uncertainty, discouraging new investment projects. The upshot has been a continuous decline of long-term growth expectations in the euro area, all of which adds to the downward pressure on real rates. Such post-debt crisis effects have been visible in many advanced economies, contributing to the low level of global interest rates we see today. But most would agree that the negative impact of the crisis has been stronger for the euro area than for other jurisdictions. The reason for this is that certain features of the euro area have made working through a debt crisis harder and more protracted, namely institutional and structural weaknesses at both national and euro area levels. The absence of an integrated euro area banking system is one such weakness. The Great Moderation – and a euro-specific misrepresentation of the type of risk that investors were exposed to when accepting to finance imbalances in other members of the monetary union – had encouraged a formidable expansion in cross-border banking activities prior to the crisis. Yet despite an illusion of integration, the euro area still effectively consisted of multiple juxtaposed national banking systems. Large savings and investment gaps within monetary union were therefore financed mainly through short-term banking debt, creating latent vulnerability to a “sudden stop”. When the cycle turned, there was little scope for risks to be reallocated across the union – also due to lack of formal macroeconomic risk-sharing mechanisms in the architecture of our Treaty institutions. Worse, as banks in some of the most vulnerable countries remained heavily exposed to their own sovereigns, the banking sector in fact amplified the crisis via the “diabolical loop” between banks and sovereigns. In these ways the structure of the euro area banking sector interacted with the incomplete construction of our institutions to aggravate financial fragmentation and credit constraints, thereby magnifying the impact of balance sheet adjustment on the economy. Other mechanisms which could have cushioned the shock also turned out to be unavailable. The possibility for a sequenced macroeconomic deleveraging, where the public sector leverages while the private sector deleverages, was hindered by fragile public finances entering the crisis and a weak fiscal framework that could not maintain market confidence in public debt. Fiscal policy has therefore been largely pro-cyclical, and all sectors have had to deleverage simultaneously in a context of weak nominal growth. Ways to accelerate balance sheet restructuring while minimising its fallout on the economy were also inoperative due to shortcomings in the legal frameworks of many countries. In particular, weak national insolvency frameworks and slow judicial systems made write-offs and resolution of bad loans a more negligible source of debt reabsorption in the euro area, 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  especially compared with other post-crisis experiences, such as that of the US or the UK. All this has contributed to continuing savings and investment imbalances. The final component affecting long-term interest rates is the term premium. Here too longer-term forces have mingled with more cyclical dynamics connected to the financial crisis to push nominal interest rates down. Term premia in the euro area have been suppressed – including before the crisis – by supply and demand imbalances for safe assets at the global level, especially as increasing demand from foreign investors has interacted with a shrinking supply of highly-rated securities denominated in euro, owing to crisis-time downgrades of certain sovereign issuers and progress in fiscal consolidation in some other AAA issuers. More recently, regulatory changes under Basel III have boosted demand for safe assets even further. Safe-haven flows in periods of financial unrest have also exacerbated these effects. The role of monetary policy7 Monetary policy has certainly contributed to reducing interest rates. Yet our policy should be understood as a response to this challenging context. Monetary policy cannot affect the secular forces weighing on the euro area economy, nor can it provide an answer to our institutional and structural questions. What it can and must do, however, is respond to the weakness in aggregate demand and the disinflationary pressures that creates. That is essentially the course we have been steering with our policy since 2008, and it is in fact remarkable that, given the strength of the headwinds, inflation has remained relatively stable. We have always addressed signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations with determination. This is testament to the role of monetary policy in preserving a nominal anchor. Given the depth and length of the crisis, however, that anchor could not be provided through conventional monetary policy alone. The short-term interest rate has eventually run into its effective lower bound, reducing the potential for further rates cuts to support the economy. And even before the short-term rate became constrained in this way, we have also, unlike other economic areas, had to deal with serious disruptions in the transmission of our policy caused by the financial fragmentation of the euro area. We have therefore had no choice but to resort to unconventional measures to ensure price stability in this environment. Operating in a bank-centric economy, the main focus of our unconventional measures in the early phase of the crisis was ensuring the transmission of our policy across banking institutions, in the context of a generalised collapse in the interbank market. Then, when fragmentation became more pronounced along national lines in the post-debt crisis phase starting in 2011, our focus shifted more to ensuring adequate liquidity to banking sectors. By the middle of last year, however, it became clear that the measures we had adopted to provide a liquidity backstop for banks were becoming less effective, in terms of their pass-through into credit conditions for the real economy, as banks were actively deleveraging. We therefore adopted the Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO), as part of our credit easing package, in order to create incentives for banks to lock-in low long-term central bank funding and originate cheaper loans to the real economy. After we launched this credit easing in the summer 2014, the inflation picture materially worsened. Throughout the second half of the year macroeconomic outlook deteriorated and underlying inflation dynamics weakened, which began to spillover into long-term inflation expectations. That fall in inflation expectations also corresponded to a rise in real interest rates – an effective monetary tightening. Faced with growing disinflationary risks, and with the scope for rate cuts now exhausted, we at that point moved to asset purchases as the                                                 7  For this section see charts 15–17. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  main tool to expand our monetary policy stance. This was the context in which we launched our expanded Asset Purchase Programme (APP). We are generally satisfied with how these measures are working so far, and we will continue our monthly asset purchases until the end of September 2016, or beyond if necessary, and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our price stability objective. Notably, our asset purchases have contributed to a compression of term premia, which are currently negative according to several model-based estimates. Our measures are also having a positive impact on transmission. Banks’ intermediation capacity is strengthening via the incipient improvement in their asset quality and increased profitability. Bank lending rates for both households and non-financial corporations (NFCs) are converging downwards across euro area countries, with those banks that participated in at least one of the TLTROs reducing lending rates to NFCs – including SMEs – more than non-participating banks. And the July 2015 Bank Lending Survey showed improving lending conditions, which we expect to support the recovery in loan growth. Banks have so far been able to buffer borrowers from the higher rates that they now face in the market following the recent re-pricing in financial markets. The improving macroeconomic environment has lowered other costs faced by banks’, such as the amount of provisioning required for non-performing loans, and has thereby allowed them not to pass-through their higher cost of financing to borrowers. Still, credit is starting from a low base and volumes on aggregate remain relatively weak. The justification for our credit easing therefore remains very much in place. Moreover, the Governing Council will remain vigilant that recent volatility does not materially affect the broad array of financial conditions and therefore lead to an unwarranted tightening of the monetary policy stance. On the real side, while our measures are feeding through to domestic demand, we do observe a deceleration in the pace of economic recovery. The latest ECB staff projections see lower growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017 as well as a slower increase in inflation rates compared with the previous exercise in June. The weaker growth outlook primarily reflects slower growth in emerging markets, while the downward revisions to inflation are largely explained by lower oil prices. On account of the external environment, risks to both euro area activity and inflation are on the downside, and these risks have intensified since the cut-off date of 12 August for the technical assumptions which underpin the projections. In this context, the Governing Council will closely monitor the risks to the inflation outlook over the medium-term. It has emphasised its willingness and ability to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within its mandate. In particular, the asset purchase programme contains sufficient flexibility to adjust its size, composition and duration. To sum up, low interest rates are ultimately a consequence of weak secular trends, coupled with the cyclical consequences of a complex debt crisis, exacerbated by a monetary union with institutional and structural flaws. “Normalisation” is therefore not about the central bank raising policy rates or removing the accommodation provided through its unconventional policy measures – this would only result in too tight a monetary policy stance and make the situation worse – it is about addressing each of these underlying drivers that are holding real rates and inflation expectations down. Addressing structural and institutional challenges Monetary easing alone cannot achieve this. Certainly, our policy creates the pre-conditions for rates to rise back towards more normal levels. When expected real rates are below expectations of economic growth – as we see at present – there should be incentives for entrepreneurs to capitalise on this differential to invest in new projects, increasing the demand for funds. Incomes also rise faster than debts, supporting a faster deleveraging and reducing the supply of funds. But monetary policy is only a necessary condition for “normalisation”; it is not a sufficient one. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  If monetary policy is to have its full effects on the economic cycle, it needs to be supported by policies that help dislodge negative sentiment about the euro area’s prospects and induce higher investment. It is surprising, for example, that businesses currently perceive themselves to have limited excess capacity, despite a large estimated output gap. Expectations of long-term prospects are also depressed. If such pessimism were to persist, we would risk that low investment and high unemployment enter a feedback loop, increasing the likelihood of the economy settling into a form of “underemployment equilibrium”. Cyclical drags would then become structural. In my view addressing this situation has three parts. The first is boosting the euro area’s long-term growth prospects, which given our demographics comes down chiefly to raising TFP. The determinants of TFP growth are complex, but broadly speaking it is a function of within-firm and across-firm efficiency. The former relates to how well firms innovate and adopt new technology, while the latter relates to how well capital and labour reallocate to the most productive firms. Structural reforms are decisive in both cases. OECD research finds that structural factors produce considerable differences in productivity diffusion from frontier firms8 as well in the responsiveness of labour and capital to innovative activity.9 The second part is accelerating the process of private sector debt workout within the euro area. Raising productivity growth would certainly support this, insofar as higher long-term growth increases future debt service capacity. But reductions in numerator of the debt ratio – nominal debt – must also be part of the equation. The provisioning for non-performing loans as part of the Comprehensive Assessment takes us halfway towards a solution. What is now key is that written-down loans can be quickly restructured through more efficient insolvency regimes10 or worked out privately through deepening markets for distressed debt. The Capital Markets Union project could be an important catalyst here as it should ultimately induce convergence in both these areas. The third part is addressing the institutional incompleteness of our monetary union. There are several dimensions to this, as laid out in the recent Five Presidents’ Report, but a priority is completing Banking Union and the integration of the euro area banking sector. This could have a direct impact on investment, insofar as it encourages financial reintegration and reduces credit frictions. Institutional reform is also necessary, and would act as a statement of intent on behalf of members of their lasting commitment to the euro area. Progress on these three fronts would not only go a long way towards removing the factors preventing higher and sustainable growth. It would also accelerate the normalisation of interest rates away from low levels. Conclusion Let me conclude. What I have tried to explain today is that the central bank policies should not be interpreted as a cause of low interest rates but rather as a consequence of economic malaise and disinflationary pressures, which the central bank aims to forestall. That is to say, they are simply the mirror image of global and euro area specific factors that are pulling both long-term nominal and real interest rates down to very low levels. Addressing those factors with determination can accelerate the process of “normalisation”.                                                 8  OECD, “The Future of Productivity”, OECD Policy Note, 2015. 9  Andrews, D., C.

   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  That implies on our side the full implementation of the asset purchase programme, on which the cyclical recovery hinges. And it implies on the side of other policymakers addressing the structural and institutional factors that are preventing our monetary policy from producing a stronger and more sustained recovery. In other words, a lasting return to normalcy depends on all policymakers playing their part – and the longer others wait, the greater the hurdles that the euro area will ultimately have to climb. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Philip Lowe: International and domestic adjustment Speech by Mr Philip Lowe, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), Melbourne, 9 September 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. I would like to thank Tim Atkin and Kevin Lane for assistance in the preparation of this talk. I would like to begin by thanking the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) for the invitation to address this lunch. It is a pleasure to be able to speak at another CEDA function, particularly one here in Melbourne. A central theme of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) communication over the past few years has been that the Australian economy is in a period of transition: a transition from the biggest resources boom in over a century to something a bit more normal. The sheer scale of the resources boom means that this transition has its challenges. And these challenges are being compounded by what is happening beyond our shores. A second theme of our communication, however, has been that a reasonably successful transition is possible, and indeed, probable. This assessment reflects the positive fundamentals of our economy, as well as its underlying flexibility. This flexibility helped us deal with the upswing of the resources boom and is now helping us deal with the downswing. And a third theme of our communication has been that monetary policy is helping this adjustment, but that the likelihood of a successful transition would be boosted by a lift in underlying productivity growth and an increase in the expected risk-adjusted return on capital formation – both physical capital and human capital. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to touch on each of these three themes. I think it is useful to start with recent developments in the global economy, particularly in China, as they form an important backdrop to the adjustment that we are going through. And then I would like to focus on the ongoing adjustment in our own economy. Global developments So, first to the global backdrop. Perhaps the main news over the past month or so is that from China. In particular, two developments in Chinese financial markets have caught people’s attention. The first is the very sharp decline in the Chinese equity market and the second is the decision by the Chinese authorities to allow the renminbi to depreciate against the US dollar. In the Chinese equity market, prices have fallen by almost 40 per cent since mid June (Graph 1). This fall has reversed around two-thirds of the increase that occurred over the previous year. The reasons for this earlier increase are not entirely clear. One possible factor was an easing of some restrictions on margin financing. Another was an expectation by Chinese citizens of future capital gains, perhaps as the equity market opened up to increased investment from overseas. A third was the weakness in residential property markets. Whatever the reason, as so often happens, things went too far. Many investors thought the increase in equity prices would keep going and many borrowed money to get a bigger stake in what was a rising market. A bubble developed. And then it burst. While this attracted much attention, these movements in the Chinese equity market are likely to have only limited implications for the overall Chinese economy. In terms of the exchange rate, for much of the past few years, the renminbi has moved closely with the US dollar (Graph 2). This meant that as the US dollar appreciated, so too did 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the Chinese currency; on a trade-weighted basis, the renminbi had appreciated by around 15 per cent between mid 2014 and the end of July this year. With the US and Chinese economies being in different phases of the business cycle, it is unsurprising that the Chinese authorities might have come to the conclusion that greater flexibility of the renminbi against the US dollar was warranted. Notably, a move in this direction is also consistent with the authorities’ long-standing goal of transitioning to a more market-determined exchange rate. While the change in the Chinese exchange rate also attracted much attention, the magnitude of the change does need to be kept in some perspective. At around 3 per cent, the recent depreciation is hardly out of line with the short-term movements that are sometimes seen among the major freely floating currencies of the world. These developments in the Chinese financial markets have coincided with signs of some further slowing in the Chinese economy. Many of the recent indicators – including those for industrial production, fixed asset investment and retail trade – have been somewhat softer than earlier in the year (Graph 3). The same is true for various business surveys and Chinese exports. In contrast, one area that has looked a little more positive of late is the residential property market. In some of the larger cities, property prices have been increasing again, although construction activity has yet to pick up noticeably. Over the past month, the news out of China has had significant ripple effects on global equity markets. Volatility has picked up and many of the major equity markets are down around 10 per cent from their levels a few months ago. Volatility has also picked up in commodity markets and most commodity prices are also lower than a few months ago. It is noteworthy though that this increased volatility in equity and commodity markets has not led to dislocation in other financial markets. In particular, there has not been a deterioration in funding markets and credit spreads have mostly moved in a relatively narrow range. This recent focus on developments in China has, understandably, thrown the spotlight on the outlook for the Chinese economy. Assessing this outlook is complicated by the fact that China is simultaneously adjusting to slower growth in potential output and dealing with a relatively soft phase of its own business cycle. The slowing in potential output growth – after an extraordinary period of sustained double-digit growth – was inevitable and, indeed, widely expected. It has, however, brought into sharper focus some of the structural challenges facing the Chinese economy. These include: • the challenge of shifting from investment-led to consumption-led growth • the challenge of liberalising the markets for important factors of production – including labour, land, capital and energy • the challenge of demographic change, with the Chinese working-age population now declining and the overall population ageing • the challenge of dealing with various strains and distortions in the financial system and the property market. At various times the Chinese authorities have acknowledged each of these challenges and a range of plans has been developed to deal with them. However, how successful these plans ultimately turn out to be is yet to be seen. There is no doubt that the economic outcomes in China over the past few decades have been remarkable, with hundreds of millions of people being lifted out of poverty. The challenges, however, are not getting any easier, and the authorities’ recent handling of the stock market crash has led some to ponder the general direction of Chinese policy, including the likely pace of reform across the economy. This is an issue that will bear close watching over the months ahead. From a cyclical perspective, the Chinese authorities have taken a number of steps recently to support growth. Increased spending on infrastructure is one of these. Nominal benchmark 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  interest rates have been reduced, although with inflation declining, real rates have tended to rise over the past year (Graph 4). Reserve requirements in the banking system have also been lowered, although this was designed to offset the withdrawal of liquidity that has taken place as the Chinese authorities have sold foreign exchange reserves in response to private capital outflow from China. The depreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar can also be expected to provide some support, at the margin, to the Chinese economy. So, overall, it is a complicated picture at present in Australia’s largest single trading partner. We became used to extraordinarily strong growth in China and now we are having to get used to something a little less extraordinary, and we are also being reminded that China too has a business cycle. Nevertheless, it remains the case that there are still significant mutually beneficial opportunities from deeper economic relations between Australia and China. As a nation, we need to keep an eye on these opportunities, while, at the same time, understanding and managing the associated risks as best we can. Elsewhere, the recent economic data have mostly had a slightly more positive tone. The US economy is recording above-average growth and the unemployment rate is around most estimates of full employment. In Europe, the economic news has recently tended to be a bit better than it had been earlier in the year and a recovery, of sorts, is taking place there. In India, too, the growth momentum looks to have improved, although in a number of countries in east Asia, both domestic demand and export growth have slowed. For the globe as a whole, economic conditions continue to be supported by the decline in oil prices. In addition, the drag from fiscal consolidation has lessened in several countries. Monetary conditions also remain very accommodative. At some point before too long, we should hope that the US economy is sufficiently strong for the Federal Reserve to begin the process of normalising interest rates there. A stronger US economy should be good for the rest of the world, although financial market developments will need to be watched carefully given that the policy interest rate in the United States has been at zero for almost seven years now. Putting all this together, when the RBA published its latest forecasts a bit over a month ago, we were expecting GDP growth in our trading partners to be around average over the next couple of years (Graph 5). While recent news on global industrial production has been softer, on balance, the recent data have not changed this general outlook materially. We still expect GDP growth in our trading partners to average around 4 per cent over 2015 and 2016, although given recent developments in east Asia the risks around this central forecast are tilted a little to the downside. The domestic transition I would now like to turn to the adjustment in the domestic economy. The broad story here is well known. Over the past decade, Australia has experienced an extremely large external shock in the form of a resources boom (Graph 6). This shock has had three phases. The first phase was a very large increase in commodity prices. The second was a very large increase in resources sector investment. And the third phase is a very large increase in resources sector production and exports. While these various phases have overlapped at times, we are now very much in this third phase, in which higher production is generating increased exports, but commodity prices are much lower than they were a few years ago and resources sector investment is returning to more normal levels. During the first two stages there was a significant reallocation of resources within the Australian economy. This was important in avoiding the overheating that had characterised 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  previous resources booms. But an adjustment back the other way is now taking place, and has been for some time. Indeed, the terms of trade have been declining for almost four years now, after having peaked in the second half of 2011. Over this period, the global supply of commodities has increased substantially as new investment projects have come on stream over the past four years. Largely as a result, the prices of our exports relative to our imports have fallen by around 30 per cent. This decline brings the terms of trade back to around their level in the mid 2000s, which was considerably higher than their average of the 1990s. The peak in mining investment occurred around a year after the peak in the terms of trade. In mid 2012, mining investment reached a record high of around $30 billion per quarter. Since that time, it has fallen significantly to be around $20 billion in the June quarter this year. Further declines still lie ahead as more projects are completed, although the end of these large declines now looks to be coming into sight; our current forecasts have mining investment declining to around $10 billion per quarter by the end of 2017. If this does turn out to be the case then we are currently roughly halfway through the decline in mining investment. In contrast, the ramp-up in resources sector output is still under way. Over the past three years, resource exports are up by 20 per cent and annual increases of around 9 per cent are expected over the next couple of years as LNG production increases. While there is inevitably a degree of imprecision in the estimates, this increase in LNG exports is expected to boost GDP growth by an average of around ¾ percentage point in each of 2016 and 2017. Through this third phase of the mining boom, the economy overall has been growing at an annual rate of between 2 and 2½ per cent (Graph 7). The quarterly readings for GDP continue to be affected by fluctuations in mining production due to the weather. But looking through this volatility, the data for the June quarter suggest that the economy is continuing to grow at a similar rate to that of the past few years. Most other recent indicators are also consistent with a moderate expansion in the Australian economy. Measures of business conditions have improved and most are now above average. The unemployment rate has been little changed over the past year and the demand for labour has increased, with a rise in employment relative to the working-age population. The housing cycle remains in an upswing and household consumption is growing moderately (Graph 8). For many in the community, the fact that growth is occurring at only a moderate pace is disappointing. Growth has been slower than we had become used to, and slower, I think, than we are capable of. And, in terms of our incomes, this has been compounded by the decline in prices of resource exports. As a result, there has been very little growth in our real income per capita for some years now, after a decade and a half of very strong growth. While this disappointment is understandable, we should not lose sight of the fact that our economy has shown considerable ability to adjust, and to do so in a way that has preserved both overall economic and financial stability. We have adjusted to the upside of a huge positive international demand shock without overheating and we are now adjusting to the downside while still managing to grow at a moderate rate. This is a significant achievement and is a testimony to the underlying flexibility of our economy. This flexibility should give us come confidence about the future. An important element of this flexibility is the exchange rate (Graph 9). When the terms of trade initially started to fall and the decline in mining investment was clearly in sight, the exchange rate was relatively slow to adjust. On a number of occasions, the RBA drew attention to this. But the exchange rate has now adjusted considerably and this adjustment has continued over recent weeks. Just as the appreciation helped stabilise the economy in the upswing of the boom in commodity prices and mining investment, the depreciation is helping in the downswing. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  One example of this is in the tourism industry. As the relative cost of overseas travel has increased, more Australians are holidaying domestically and more people are visiting our shores. Encouragingly, we are now seeing some signs that this change in travel patterns is prompting a pick-up in investment in the tourism industry. In particular, there has been a noticeable increase in the stock of work to be done in the construction of hotel and related accommodation (Graph 10). The RBA’s liaison with tourism-related businesses suggests that further increases in investment in this area are likely in coming years. Conditions have also improved in a number of other sectors that are sensitive to the exchange rate. Another element of the flexibility has been the labour market, both in terms of labour supply and wages (Graph 11). During the upswing, population growth picked up noticeably, partly due to a rise in immigration. This helped alleviate some of the pressures in the labour market that would have otherwise occurred, especially in areas where skills were in short supply. In the downward phase, population growth has slowed, again partly due to immigration. Aggregate wage growth has also moderated significantly. This has played some role in generating sufficient employment growth over recent times to keep the unemployment rate steady despite the below-average growth of the overall economy. A third element of this flexibility has been monetary policy. As the RBA has frequently noted, it is entirely appropriate that, during a period in which both the terms of trade and mining investment are declining, monetary policy is accommodative. Monetary policy is helping support growth in the overall economy even if it is not working in quite the same way as it once did. This support is most clearly evident in the interest-sensitive housing construction sector, where investment has increased by 7 per cent over the past year. The stronger housing market is also having some positive ripple effects on parts of the retail sector. So, together, the flexibility of the exchange rate, the labour market and monetary policy is helping with the cyclical adjustment in our economy. The missing ingredient continues to be a lift in non-mining business investment, where we are still waiting for convincing signs of a pick-up. The latest reading from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on firms’ capital spending plans outside the resources sector did show a slight improvement from earlier readings, but a material lift in non-mining business investment still seems to be some way away. In time, though, we should expect that the adjustments that we have seen in the cyclical variables – the exchange rate, the labour market and interest rates – will help create the environment that leads to increased investment. But there are clearly limits here. A low exchange rate, low growth in wages and low interest rates are not the basis for sustained increases in investment and output. They can certainly help during the adjustment phase, but ultimately we will be better off if increased investment is driven by high expected returns rather than by the low cost of finance or low wages. This is why the focus on improving the climate for business investment is so important. There is no magic bullet here, but surely the investment climate would be improved through a strong focus by both business and government on innovation, productivity, human capital and entrepreneurship, topics that I have spoken about on previous occasions. Thank you and I would be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Guy Debelle: Bond market liquidity, long-term rates and China Speech by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Actuaries Institute “Banking on Change” Seminar, Sydney, 16 September 2015. *      *      * I am going to talk about three key current issues in financial markets, namely bond market liquidity, long-term interest rates and China’s exchange rate regime. All three are having an important bearing on financial market prices round the world, including here in Australia, both now and probably for quite some time to come. They may not sound that interrelated but I will tie them together at the end. Bond market liquidity I will start with bond market liquidity. If you have read any financial market media over the past year, you would have been hard-pressed to avoid reading an article on bond market liquidity. Indeed, one of the best financial market commentators, Matt Levine, devotes a section of his column to “people are worried about bond market liquidity”.1 Notwithstanding the fact that his column is published daily, he has little problem in finding material to write about on this issue. So today, I would like to provide Matt Levine with some more material and throw my hat into this crowded ring. Though not for the first time, as about a year ago I talked about this very issue.2 So why revisit this issue again today? Here are a few reasons: First, one year on, there have been a few noteworthy liquidity “events” in the bond market, including the awkwardly named “Flash Rally” in US Treasuries on 15 October 2014, the day after I gave the speech last year. Second, the much anticipated first increase in the Fed funds rate has been designated as a critical test case of the state of liquidity in the bond market. Third, while equity markets experienced a volatile month in August, bond markets were, somewhat surprisingly, relatively stable (as for that matter, were major foreign exchange rates). That serves to highlight the fact that liquidity and volatility are related but are not the same thing. So what exactly do I mean by bond market liquidity? Generally I would take it to mean the ability to transact in the bond market without having a material influence on the price. For example, if I want to sell some of my holdings of Australian Government securities, how much will I be able to sell, and over what time period, without having a significant impact on market pricing? This question highlights two points: there is both a quantity dimension and a time dimension to liquidity. If I try to sell all my securities at once, my impact on the market is likely to be larger than if I break my order up into smaller pieces and sell it over a period of time. However, if I do the latter and sell gradually, there is a risk that the market price moves against me over that period of time, because of news or other people’s transactions and I don’t get as good an overall price.                                                 1  See for example, <http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015–06–03/people-are-worried-about-bond-market-liquidity>. Of late, there has also been the occasional column on people who are not worried about bond market liquidity. 2  “Volatility and Market Pricing”, speech to Citi’s 6th Annual Australian and New Zealand Investment Conference, Sydney, 14 October 2014. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The quantity and time element of liquidity is often conflated in the discussion of bond market liquidity. Hence you can hear that it is currently simultaneously the best of times and the worst of times for liquidity in the bond market. Bond market liquidity at the “top of book” is, on a number of metrics,3 as good as it has ever been. That is, my ability to sell a small parcel of bonds very close to the current market price is very good. But the “depth of book”, my ability to sell a large parcel of bonds, is nowhere near as good, and worse than its been for quite some time. How can it be that we have both of these two developments? This outcome reflects the evolution of the market over recent years in response to technological changes, regulatory changes as well as institutional appetite for this activity. In terms of technology, there has been a significant increase in the share of electronic trading in bond markets. In the Australian market, we estimate that electronic trading accounts for around one-third of trading in the Australian government securities market (though it is considerably less in other domestic bond markets). In the US, the share of electronic trading is much higher, more than half of turnover. With the increased electronification of the market has come high-frequency trading firms. These firms are providing increased liquidity at the top of the book, but are not necessarily contributing to the depth of the book, given their preference to trade in small size, as well as in many cases, inability to trade in large size because of balance sheet constraints. They have contributed to lower transaction costs (in terms of the bid-ask spread) for small orders. But there are question marks around their resilience in times of market stress. The key structural change is the shift in market share from those who provide immediate and continuous liquidity and have the ability to warehouse risk to those who do the same but don’t have the capacity to warehouse risk. In this regard, the bond market has followed the well-trodden path of the equity market and later the foreign exchange market of increased electronic trading and increased participation by high-frequency traders (HFT). Not all would regard the “equitisation” of the bond market (or foreign exchange market for that matter) as a good thing.4  The report recently released by the US authorities examining the “Flash Rally” in the US bond market on 15 October 2014 highlights some of the issues.5 To remind you briefly what happened on that day. About an hour after a slightly weaker than expected US data release, 10-year US Treasury bond yields fell rapidly by 16 basis points in six minutes (that is the price went up, hence a flash rally) before reversing course and almost retracing that move over the next six minutes. If you had taken a well-timed coffee break over that 12 minutes, you would have been none the wiser that anything much had happened. The report was not able to come to any conclusions about what caused this to occur, though investigations are ongoing. But it does provide information about the structure of US treasury market through that time, including the share of high-frequency firms, or proprietary trading firms (PTFs) as the report calls them, in the market. One interesting fact is that one firm had a relatively high share of both sides of the market, in part because a sizeable share of trades was being done with itself. That is, it was buying and selling US treasuries with itself. Another noteworthy fact is that the price adjustment was smooth throughout, there was no gapping in                                                 3  See “Market-making and proprietary trading: industry trends, drivers and policy implications”, CGFS report no. 52, November 2014, for a discussion and analysis of various liquidity metrics.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  prices. So this event does not fit neatly into the category of a liquidity event. There was no prolonged dislocation where the price gapped rapidly and stayed there, which is often what people have in mind when thinking about the consequences of lower liquidity. Nevertheless, the fact that such events can occur in arguably the most deep and liquid market in the world does mean that we need to understand what is going on here. As well as the impact of technology, regulation has also had a significant effect. Regulatory changes have increased the cost to banks of intermediation, and hence liquidity provision, in many markets, and particularly the bond market. This has seen a number of participants withdraw completely and others scale back their activities. Bond desks at banks hold less inventory than they have done historically, given the increased cost of doing so. This contributes to less “depth of book” liquidity, though not necessarily less “top of book” liquidity. The regulatory changes were intended to have this effect. Liquidity provision was under-priced previously and was over-supplied. Regulation has increased the cost of providing liquidity and hence decreased the quantity supplied. So the direction of change should not be the issue, rather the extent of the change should be the focus of debates about bond market liquidity. That is, has regulation increased the cost of liquidity provision too far with the result that liquidity in the bond market is now too low? That is certainly a discussion worth having. But in the meantime, liquidity in the bond market today is what it is. It continues to evolve but it is not going back to what it was any time soon. So participants in the bond market need to adjust to the current situation rather than simply complain about it. If transaction costs are higher, particularly for transacting in large size, then asset managers and other bond holders need to take account of that in the way they execute their transaction in the market. For example, as discussed above, one solution may be to execute more slowly in smaller parcel sizes. Execution certainly needs to be more nimble and considered than in the past. But perhaps more importantly, the increased transaction costs in terms of liquidity and execution should also be taken into account in the way an asset manager constructs its portfolio. The differences in transaction costs across various classes need to be taken into account. If transaction costs are higher, then perhaps I should be transacting less. Do I really need to be selling? In some cases, I might not have much choice, because the need to transact may be driven by the mandate I have been given. But in that case, a discussion should at least be had with the provider of the mandate highlighting the higher transaction costs and the implications that has for the portfolio. Or maybe I need to transact because of redemption flows out of my fund. In that situation, I may need to think about holding a higher liquidity buffer than I did in the past. If the cost of obtaining liquidity in the market from my bond portfolio is higher than it used to be, then I need to think about weighing that up against the cost of holding more liquidity on my own balance sheet to accomodate potential redemption flows. Let me now turn to another concern that is often expressed around bond market liquidity, namely that, with the decline in intermediation by the banks, the likelihood of market dislocation is higher. This often comes up in discussions around the consequences of the Fed tightening monetary policy resulting in a large sell-off in bond markets. The “taper tantrum” of 2013 is often invoked as an example. This saw a rapid rise in bond yields in a number of emerging markets following indications that the Fed was going to wind down its quantitive easing program. As I said last year, I think the issue is not so much one of a decline in liquidity as much as a decline in the capacity to warehouse risk. In the past, when there was a large sell-off in bond markets, liquidity was never that great. A bank has no more desire than any other investor to catch a falling knife. Bid-ask spreads widen considerably and the depth of book deteriorates. That has always been the case. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  However, in addition to a decline in liquidity provision, banks now have less risk-warehousing capacity than they did in the past. They are less able to be nimble buyers of assets whose prices they believe have overshot. In the past, while the banks may have pulled back for a while as prices fell, they were generally among the first to step in and buy when they felt that the price had overshot. This is one important aspect of what I mean by warehousing or absorbing risk. As a result of regulatory changes as well as their own risk tolerances, they are less willing and able to do this today. Many real money investors are not able to move so quickly to take advantage of overshooting prices. The degree of discretion is generally not as large. Mandates often impose the constraint of not straying too far from benchmarks, and it takes a long time to change mandates to respond to changes in market circumstances. Are there other participants in the market who are able to move so rapidly and agilely to perform that function today? I’m sure they exist but I’m not so sure that there are enough of them. I suspect we will soon find out. If there is less capacity to do this, then prices will move by larger amounts and remain away from equilibrium values for longer. Volatility will be higher. In itself, this is not necessarily a bad thing. It is what it is. But with higher volatility, the distribution of price movements will have fatter tails. Overshooting will be more likely and that can have long-lasting and more deleterious consequences. Given that, some have recommended that central banks step in and play the role of market-maker of last resort. Without debating the merits of that proposal today, it is worth pointing out that the term “market-maker of last resort” is misrepresenting the role being played here. A market-maker makes two-way prices, both buying and selling. In a dislocated market, with most of the trading one-way, the central bank would only be buying, it wouldn’t be selling the asset to anyone else anytime soon. A more appropriate description is buyer of last resort, with the risk to the central bank’s balance sheet that comes from performing that role. Long-term yields I will now talk a bit about an issue that is of direct relevance to actuaries. Is the government bond rate still the appropriate risk-free yield? Is it lower now than it used to be and will it stay there? On the first question, in my opinion, the answer is still yes. Ultimately the risk-free yield should be something that approximates the growth rate of the economy. On that basis, the government bond yield is still doing a pretty good job. Yes, policy actions in some of the major economies might have pushed the yield lower than it might otherwise have been. But those policy actions reflect the growth circumstance in which we find ourselves. In Australia, partly as a result of those policy actions, we have seen foreign holdings of Australian government securities increase to over 75 per cent at its peak, though it’s a bit lower than that now. Again, I don’t see these purchases as distorting the Australian government bond yield, but rather reflecting the reality of the world we live in. So with government bond yields around historical lows in recent years, should that be reflected in the discount rates used in actuarial calculations? How long is this period of low rates going to last? I’m not going to answer the question directly. But again it’s useful to think of it in terms of economic growth rates. Secular stagnation is often put forward as a reason why growth rates will be lower than they used to be. There are various theories of secular stagnation around, but a number of them boil down to the proposition that the rate of innovation and technological progress will be lower now and in the future than it has been in the past. Personally I find that very defeatist, and ultimately speculative. We simply don’t know what the future will bring. There have been quite a number of times in the past where such a claim has been made which has subsequently been proven wrong. Maybe it’s right this time, but I don’t see any reason to give up yet. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  In Australia, one factor which does have a significant influence on real growth rates is the rate of population growth. That has slowed in Australia of late, which means there are some grounds to believe that the medium-term growth rate of the economy has slowed, in which case discount rates should probably be lower. But the orders of magnitude we are talking about are pretty small, of the order of a quarter of a per cent. That is well within the range of error around our knowledge of the longer term growth rate of the economy. That said, I realise a quarter of a percentage point can matter a lot actuarially when compounded over a number of years. So to sum up, I continue to believe the government bond yield is the best measure of the risk-free yield in the economy. There are some reasons to believe that is now structurally lower than it used to be, but I find the proposition that the future rate of technological progress will be lower too pessimistic. China’s exchange rate I will just say a few words about the recent developments in China’s exchange rate, picking up on some of the points highlighted in the RBA Board minutes released yesterday, as well as my colleague Phil Lowe’s speech last week.6 As you probably know, the Chinese authorities made a notable change to their foreign exchange rate regime on 11th August. On that day, the Chinese authorities moved the exchange rate regime further along the path to a more market-determined rate, a development which should be welcomed. The initial effect was for the Chinese exchange rate to depreciate by around 4½ per cent. This is not all that big in the general scheme of exchange rate moves (though it generated a very large amount of commentary). Moreover it comes in the context of a more than 15 per cent appreciation of China’s exchange rate in trade-weighted terms over the past year as the RMB moved up in lock-step with the US dollar. I want to focus here on one aspect of the change in the regime. As part of their efforts to limit the appreciation of the RMB over more than a decade, the Chinese authorities had accumulated US$ 4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. This occurred in an environment of a sizeable current account surplus combined with significant flows of capital into China as well as stringent restrictions on the ability of Chinese citizens to invest abroad. However, that environment has changed, China still runs a current account surplus, though it is smaller than it was a few years back. Most importantly, China is now experiencing sizeable capital outflows as the easing of restrictions on capital flows has allowed Chinese citizens to invest abroad. As a result, the Chinese authorities have of late, in the face of these capital outflows, been intervening to hold up their exchange rate, rather than hold it down. Consequently, China’s foreign exchange reserves have declined by around half a trillion US dollars. We don’t know what the Chinese are selling because we don’t know the composition of their reserve holdings. But it probably involves some US treasuries and other sovereign bonds. Nor do we know what assets the private capital outflow from China is buying. But they are both huge orders of magnitude are most certainly having a first order influence on financial markets. One can regard the Chinese reserve accumulation as reflecting the accumulation of foreign assets by the state on behalf of the private sector who couldn’t invest abroad. Now the private sector can invest, there will be a switch as they accumulate assets while the public sector sells down its holdings. That is, a fair part of what is going at the moment is a shift in who is holding foreign assets in China, not necessarily a large change in the total quantity of                                                 6  “International and Domestic Adjustment”, speech by Philip Lowe at a Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) event, Melbourne, 9 September 2015. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  foreign assets being held by China. What matters for global financial markets is the difference in portfolio allocation between the public and private sector in China. Conclusion I have talked about three topical issues in financial markets today: bond market liquidity, long-term yields and China’s exchange rate. All three issues are important to financial markets in Australia. They are currently quite interrelated, with the rundown in China’s foreign exchange reserves probably in part comprising sales of US treasuries and other sovereign bonds, because of their greater liquidity, thereby affecting global long-term yields. We are seeing an unusual situation where a risk-off environment is associated with sales of the risk-free assets by a large market participant, rather than purchases. On bond market liquidity, the decline in liquidity is, in part, a desired outcome of regulation. Whether it has fallen too far can be debated. But the situation isn’t going to change any time soon. Market participants have to adjust their behaviour to deal with the current state of affairs. They have to consider carefully how their execution strategies will function in an environment of lower liquidity and they may also need to adjust the construction of their portfolios accordingly. Whether the changed market environment is more conducive to temporary flash crashes or permanent dislocations remains to be seen. The latter is of significantly greater concern than the former, which can be avoided by a well-timed coffee break. All three of these issues are going to be with us for a while to come. So it is important we adjust to the current environment rather than wish it was something else. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Harun R Khan: Corporate bond markets in India – a framework for further action Remarks by Mr Harun R Khan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the FICCI CAPAM 2015, Mumbai, 27 October 2015. *      *      * Accompanying tables can be found at the end of the speech. The speaker acknowledges the contributions of Shri Vaibhav Chaturvedi and Shri Vivek Singh of the Reserve Bank of India. 1. Speaking at this event – in this panel – leaves me with a sense of déjà vu. The fact that I spoke about the same issue at the same forum three years back in 2012 – and many other fora earlier – reflects the deep-rooted, inertial nature of underlying factors. At least for more than 10 years now development of corporate bond markets in India has been the focus of all stakeholders but the arduous pursuit of the ‘holy grail’ has not delivered desired results. In the process this has unfortunately become a convenient stick to flag the policy and regulatory intent. Every set of stakeholders has its own views on what needs to be done but much of the prognosis ends up giving a limited perspective. 2. Maybe it is time to dispassionately understand the big picture and acknowledge ten fundamental facts about the financial ecosystem as it exists today: i. Bond markets globally are institutional in nature – that too buy and hold kind of investors; ii. A sound bankruptcy regime is a pre-requisite for deep bond markets; iii. Development of bond markets needs sustained participation of long-term institutional investors across the credit curve; iv. Tax regime for financial instruments remains one of the key drivers of investor interest; v. Development of the market mechanisms and infrastructure can at best be an enabling factor – not the driving factor; vi. Fiscal consolidation leading to lower sovereign borrowings can enhance the demand for corporate bonds; vii. High indebtedness of major corporates both from domestic and external sources is not conducive for issuance of corporate bonds; viii. The centrality of banks in the financial system is a given at our stage of economic development. The corporate debt market, therefore, cannot play a predominant role in financing in the near future; ix. Predominant reliance on the banking system to support development of corporate bond market, directly or indirectly, militates against the very idea of the bond market de-risking the banking sector; and x. The corporate debt market cannot be looked as totally detached from the sovereign bond market. Corporate bond market may get a fillip as the interest rates come down and the fiscal deficit targets are achieved. The play on spreads across the credit curve will become more attractive. 3. Alongwith recognizing the hard facts comes the realization that there are not many low hanging fruits remaining to be plucked – work forward is contingent on multifarious factors and some hard policy choices. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  4. There have been a number of reports on the corporate bond markets, viz., R. H. Patil Committee report (December 2005), Report of the High Powered Expert Committee on Making Mumbai an International Financial Centre in 2007 (Percy Mistry Committee) and A Hundred Small Steps [Report of the Committee on Financial Sector Reforms (CFSR)] in 2009 (Raghuram Rajan Committee), Reports of the City of London, which have examined in detail various aspects related to the development of corporate bond market and have made useful recommendations. It has been recently decided by the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) and its Sub-Committee that the issue needs to be looked into its entirety. An inter-regulatory group has already started work in this direction. The focus of this group will be to distill key actionable recommendations made by all earlier committees and suggest a time bound plan for implementation of the same. Measures taken to develop the corporate debt market 5. Taking into account the recommendations made by various expert committees, several measures have been taken by the Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for the development of corporate debt market in India. The success of these measures in achieving the intended outcomes has, however, been varied. Impact of some of the measures taken is captured below: Intended outcomes mostly achieved • Setting up of reporting platform for post-trade transparency • Introduction of DvP in settlement of OTC trades in corporate bonds to eliminate settlement risk • Issue of long-term bonds by banks allowed with a minimum maturity of seven years to raise resources for lending to (a) long term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors, and (b) affordable housing. These bonds have been exempted from computation of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) and are therefore not been subjected to CRR/SLR requirements • The investment limit for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) has been increased to USD 51 billion during the last few years. Limit allocation methodology have been rationalized and withholding tax rate has been reduced from 20% to 5% • FPIs have been permitted to invest only in corporate debts of at least 3 years of residual maturity • International financial institutions like IFC were permitted to float a rupee linked bond overseas to deepen the off-shore rupee bond market so that IFC and other investors can raise rupees to invest in India. This has facilitated development of benchmark yield for long term corporate bonds • SEBI has allowed setting up of dedicated debt segment on the exchanges Intended outcomes partially achieved/ too early to say • Banks and PDs allowed to become members of stock exchanges to trade in corporate bonds • Investment norms for banks and PDs relaxed to facilitate investment in corporate bonds • Final guidelines issued for partial credit enhancements by banks to corporate bonds • Measures taken to encourage investor interest/participation in the corporate bond market in terms of liberalizing the listing requirements; simplification in procedures 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and processes, simplified disclosure norms and standardisation of market conventions • Rationalisation of FPI regulations has been put in place for easier registration process and operating framework for overseas entities seeking to invest in Indian capital markets Intended outcomes not achieved • Introduction of Repo in corporate bonds to meet the funding needs • Introduction of Credit Default Swaps to facilitate hedging of credit risk by the holders of corporate bonds Reissuance of bonds permitted by SEBI 6. The measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India, SEBI and the Government have resulted in considerable increase in issuance as well as secondary market trading of corporate bonds. Total corporate bond issuance has increased by around 155% from ₹ 2709.46 billion in 2010–11 to ₹ 4,789.62 billion in 2014–15. Similarly, the number of issuances increased by almost 77% from 4,280 in 2010–11 to 10,941 in 2014–15 (Table 1). 7. In comparison to other economies, the size of the bond market in India, however, remains moderate as a percentage of GDP (Table 2). 8. It, however, needs to be noted that the development of a corporate bond market in India has lagged behind in comparison with other financial market segments due to certain structural issues. Some of these issues include: • The corporate bond issuance is dominated by private placements as these account for more than 95% of the total issuance of corporate debt (2014–15); • Issuances are concentrated in the AA or above rating, largely by public sector entities and financial institutions • A majority of the issuances are concentrated in the 2–5 year tenor; • Limited/narrow investor base. Investment mandates of institutional investors such as insurance companies, pension funds and provident funds do not permit large investment in corporate bonds; • Reissuance of bonds has not picked up; • Lack of functional trading platform with CCP facility like NDS-OM (as available in Government securities market) impedes the growth of secondary market; • Market for credit risk protection instruments like CDS has not yet developed; • Non-standardized stamp duties on corporate bonds across various states affects issuances. Way forward 9. Activating the corporate bond market will require a number of regulatory measures to address both the macro issues as well as the market micro-structure issues. While creating an efficient market infrastructure will create conditions for issuers and investors, the structural issues can be addressed over the longer term as the market evolves and the financial system gets more integrated with international markets. It would be convenient to look at the set of issues in a comprehensive manner. I would like to classify some of the possible measures in the “7I” framework which I had talked about in one of my earlier speeches. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Issuer Reissuance of bonds 10. Corporates may be encouraged to re-issue existing bonds under the same ISIN code. This will augment market liquidity and potentially reduce the cost of borrowings. Though SEBI has recently allowed reissuances by the corporates, there has not been any reissue of bonds by any corporate. In order to encourage reissuances, there may be a need for some incentives in the form reduced documentation formalities, less issuance fees, etc. Issuance of municipal bonds 11. An active corporate bond market would enable market for municipal bonds issued by the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). The potential for issuing municipal bonds assumes importance in the context of the proposal to set up 100 smart cities. However, the size of the municipal bond market in India is rather limited and is distributed over a few strong municipalities of Ahmadabad, Nasik, Nagpur, etc. The possible reasons could be overlapping jurisdiction on municipal bodies leading to plethora of rules; perceived lack of specialized project management support in ULBs; non-transparent budgeting and accounting systems in many of the ULBs and limited exit route for investors due to lack of secondary market trading. 12. To address these issues some of the measures which could be considered, are strengthening the governance structure of the municipal issuers by ring fencing the municipal bond funds; providing partial or full guarantee by the Central/ State government; mandating Escrow account for debt servicing of bond proceeds, etc. SEBI has since issued the Regulations for Issue and Listing of Securities by Municipalities. Investor Liberalising the investment guidelines for long term players 13. In order to encourage demand, investment norms for regulated entities may be reviewed to facilitate their active participation in corporate debt market. The current investment guidelines for pension and other retirement benefit funds may be reviewed from ownership criteria (public sector / private sector) to ratings based criteria. They may also be permitted to use interest rate swaps, repos and credit default swaps. Encouraging Retail Participation 14. Participation of retail investors in corporate bonds continues to be limited. In order to increase retail investors’ participation in corporate bonds, we need to encourage issuance of zero coupon bonds, provide clarity on taxation issues, include provision of special quota for retail investors in debt issues and provide reduced transactions costs for retail investors. Intermediaries Introduction of a market making scheme 15. A market making scheme in corporate bond could potentially improve market liquidity. But market making in an illiquid market is challenging and not many intermediaries will be ready to take on the risks of making two-way quotes. A viable market making scheme may have to be formulated with suitable incentives to encourage market participants to provide two way quotes. Stock exchanges may have to come out with market making scheme in consultation with the regulators. Perhaps the role of debenture trustees in this regard may also need to be explored. Infrastructure Efficient trading platforms for corporate bonds 16. NSE has developed a dedicated trading platform for privately placed corporate bonds. There is, however, negligible activity on the trading platform. Although the system provides 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  for DVP-III guaranteed settlement, it is learnt that the system has some issues, viz. high margin, high penalty for default, non-availability of all the issued bonds on the platform, etc. According to some market participants, there is a need for combined settlement for corporate bond repo and outright market under DVP-III mechanism at par with the G-Sec market in order to increase the traders’ participation. 17. Stock exchanges could discuss with the market participants and make suitable changes in the existing platform to encourage trading. If required, they may adopt a calibrated approach in the matter and explore introduction of DVP-II settlement in initial stages and then move to DVP-III depending on development of the market. 18. An electronic trading platform similar to the CROMS platform for G-sec has been announced for repo in corporate debt. This needs to be taken forward quickly. Legal framework for recognizing and regulating such platforms may have to be put in place. Rating Agencies 19. Rating Agencies play an important role by way of providing credit evaluation of the instruments like bonds issued by corporates. Their role came into focus internationally after the Global Financial Crisis and certain principles for reform of the rating agencies had been agreed internationally. In India also, SEBI had come out with certain transparency and disclosure norms for the Credit Rating Agencies (“CRAs”) in 2010. CRAs. Based on the experience, the guidelines may need to be reviewed. Bankruptcy laws 20. A robust and effective bankruptcy regime is essential to development of corporate debt market from investors’ point of view. Steps, such as, reforming bankruptcy law, early resolution of bankruptcy cases and streamlining the procedures relating to insolvency would go a long way in achieving the same. The issue of insolvency of financial institutions established under statutes and bi-lateral netting among them during bankruptcy also need resolution. One of the most significant steps in this direction was the setting up of the Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee under Shri T. K. Viswanathan which has just submitted its report. The Committee has come out with the draft legal framework for resolving matters of insolvency and bankruptcy which, when fully implemented, will have far reaching impact. Early enactment of this proposed legislation and the follow-up action will be a game changer for development of corporate bond markets. Incentives Cap on borrowings of corporate from banks for capital purpose 21. Restricting the proportion of borrowings by large corporates from banks and making such corporates use the market mechanism (such as, corporate bonds, commercial papers and other instruments) to meet a part of their short term as well as long term financing needs will help in the development of corporate bonds markets. Reserve Bank has already issued a Discussion Paper on “Large Exposures Framework and Enhancing Credit Supply through Market Mechanism” on March 27, 2015. Resolving distribution tax related issue for securitization 22. Securitization of the corporate debt instruments would provide a big fillip to the market as it would improve risk transference and diversification and provide liquidity to the issuers. Subjecting income of SPV to tax hampers the growth of securitized debt. Market participants have been demanding that the taxation structure in securitized debt needs to be changed from distribution tax at SPV level to taxation in the hands of investors. Rationalisation of stamp duty norms 23. In terms of the provisions of entry 91 of Union List, the Central Government has the power to levy stamp duty on issue of debentures. However, some state stamp laws also 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  provide for duty on issue/transfer of debentures. Stamp duty laws need to be rationalised to provide an incentive to issuers and work is already on in this direction. Use of corporate bonds a collateral 24. Post Global Financial Crisis has seen large scale use of non-sovereign papers as collateral by the central banks for providing liquidity during periods of stress. Similar enabling arrangement in India, subject of course to appropriate haircuts and other safeguards, could be examined. This will enhance the demand for good quality corporate paper. Instruments Activating the repo market 25. The reasons cited for lack of interest in corporate bond repo include non-signing of the Global Master Repo Agreement (GMRA), lack of lenders such as mutual funds and insurance companies in repo market, etc. Reserve Bank is engaging with other regulators to address these issues. It is also envisaged to widen the participation base in corporate debt repo by allowing more investors in repo market. 26. Internationally, GMRA is the standard document used by the market participants to undertake repo transactions. In India also, we have adopted the same document. Market participants need to highlight the specific issues in GMRA which need to be addressed. Kickstarting CDS market 27. Unavailability of credit risk transfer mechanism in the corporate bond market works as a deterrent. Though CDS has been introduced in India, there is no activity in the market. One of the major constraints is restriction on netting of MTM position against the same counterparty for capital adequacy and exposure norms. Without netting, the trades in CDS have become capital intensive as banks and PDs have to provide higher capital charge on gross basis even if they are acting as market makers and having positive and negative position against the same counterparty. Netting has not been allowed due to lack of legal clarity. To provide clarity on the enforceability of netting including close-out netting, suitable amendments to provisions in the RBI Act are being proposed. 28. Regulators are also examining the possibility of allowing more entities to buy/sell protection through CDS. Availability of more number of protection sellers will encourage activity in the CDS market. In this connection, it may be necessary that financially sound insurance companies and other long term investors may be permitted to sell CDS protection subject to prudential norms prescribed by the regulators. Rated Municipal Securities 29. As discussed earlier, a new asset class may be included for rated municipal securities under the IRDA & PFRDA investment guidelines. Innovation Use of banks’ PCE facility by corporates 30. Partial credit enhancements (PCE) by banks may give a boost to the corporate bond market in its evolution phase. Taking into account the feedback received, RBI has now issued the final guidelines under which the banks may provide PCE to support (senior) project bonds issued by companies/SPVs, and thereby improve the credit rating of the bond issue making them more attractive to certain specific set of investors, such as the institutional and long term investors. It is expected that issuers will take advantage of the scheme to issue long term bonds. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Bond Index 31. Though indices, such as, Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex index serve as popular benchmarks for equities, designing debt indices has posed challenges in India as the market lacks breadth and depth. Market participants, however, need a debt index to compare the performance in corporate debt vis-a-vis the performance of different asset classes. More work needs to be done in this area by benchmark and index companies. Concluding Thoughts 32. A well-developed corporate bond market can truly address some of the travails of the existing bank-based financial system. Development of efficient and robust bond markets is a challenge globally and only a few jurisdictions can claim to have genuine local currency bond markets. Even in those markets, the concerns relating to market illiquidity are increasingly being highlighted. The recent IMF Global Financial Stability Report has discussed these factors at length. While many of the factors may not be of immediate relevance to our market, the experience may hold important lessons as the regulatory regimes and market systems across jurisdictions which are increasingly becoming homogenized. While regulatory changes are likely to have had mixed effects on market liquidity, several structural drivers, such as, concentrated holdings by institutional investors, growth of electronic platforms and high frequency trading, reduced market making, etc. have also played a part. 33. We will have to assess the implications of these factors, including the emerging regulatory regime, on corporate bond market development. While it is recognized that the regulatory regime may need to respond positively to some of the critical issues unless the structural factors mentioned earlier are addressed, it would be difficult to have a deep corporate bond market. Early implementation of the draft bankruptcy code submitted by the Viswanathan Committee alongwith providing legal certainty to close-out netting for certain transactions would address the two key issues for enabling a credit market. Work is already underway in addressing some of the market infrastructure issues, including development of an electronic platform for repo in corporate bonds. Market making in corporate bonds has proved to be a challenging issue, particularly the funding of brokers. Banks are explicitly permitted to fund market making activities but at the end of day, it will be their call based on commercial judgement. Separate structure for market making with direct/indirect support of the Government could be a possible way out. 34. It is also important to recognize that the path towards creating an enabling environment may be fraught with event-specific hurdles which may take the process a few steps back. The recent case of default on a top rated bond is a case in point. More than the fact of default, some of the market practices that have come to light through media reports can dent the confidence of investors in the market. This particular instance reiterates the importance of strong market practices and institutional frameworks in development of healthy markets. 35. While there is a continuing, concerted effort to identify the constraints and address them in right earnest, we must, however, be careful that our pursuit of perfect bond markets does not end up as an endless chimerical chase. Bond markets are part of a broader ecosystem and it would be best if these markets evolve organically. As a regulator, our endeavor is to continually facilitate an enabling framework. The group set up under the aegis of the FSDC is expected to look into the whole gamut of issues, mostly focusing on the recommendations of all the earlier committees. One can expect more exciting times ahead for the development of the corporate bond market in India.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Veerathai Santiprabhob: Monetary policy and financial sector development policy of the Bank of Thailand Speech by Dr Veerathai Santiprabhob, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Thailand Focus 2015 “Opportunity Growth and Reform”, Bangkok, 2 December 2015. *      *      * Chairman of The Stock Exchange of Thailand, Secretary General of The Securities and Exchange Commission, President of The Stock Exchange of Thailand, Chairman of Phatra Securities, and President of Asia Pacific Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, A very good morning to you all. I would like to thank The Stock Exchange of Thailand, Phatra Securities, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch for the invitation to join this year’s Thailand Focus event. I am much honored to be addressing this prestigious group of audience, and especially investor friends of Thailand from abroad. The title of my talk this morning is “Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Development Policy of the Bank of Thailand”. I would like to share with you the Bank of Thailand’s roles in supporting the Thai economy as we venture ahead in the volatile world. This year, there would be few among us who failed to notice turbulence in the financial markets worldwide. But what probably matters more is the shifting global economic forces that lie at the heart of such an incident. In the first part of my talk, I will explore volatility in the context of a “new normal” world where we observe, for instance, stagnant growth and low inflation. Then I will discuss the implications for Thailand, before moving on to policy navigation of the Bank of Thailand. Financial volatility has manifested itself throughout 2015. Let me briefly recap some of them: • Only a few months ago, the Chinese equity market recorded one-day steepest loss of 8.5 per cent and trillions of dollars were wiped off from the global equity market within a day. The fluctuations in the Shanghai stock index perfectly exemplify the market volatility where from the beginning of this year the index rose by 60 per cent up to June, before collapsing to 10 per cent loss by August. • There have also been sharp capital outflows from Emerging Markets, resulting in large Emerging Market currency depreciations. Indeed, the Institute of International Finance expects that capital flows to Emerging Markets will turn negative for the first time since 1988. • On the commodity front, Brent Crude Oil price plunged below 50 dollars per barrel this year, having peaked at over 110 dollars just one year ago. Against this backdrop, market participants have been increasingly concerned about investment and business implications. So what brought about heightened volatility in the global markets? I will attempt to answer by highlighting two key sources of volatility. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, unconventional monetary policies – most notably successive rounds of Quantitative Easing – were implemented by major advanced economies. This abundant global liquidity contributed largely to strong asset price gains and higher risk appetites. As major central banks pursued their policy of flooding the market with liquidity, risks had been compressed, intentionally or otherwise. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Recently though, despite ample global liquidity, investors have grown worried about the diverging paths of monetary policy among major central banks. That is, the Federal Reserve or the Fed is poised to begin its tightening phase while the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the People’s Bank of China are likely to continue their ongoing monetary easing for a considerable period of time. The implications of diverging monetary policy stance for asset markets have weighed on the minds of investors around the world. As I shall elaborate, it is probably not the excess liquidity per se that generates turbulence and volatility, but prospects of the exit – or reversal – that does so. In the near future, global markets are bracing for the impacts from the Fed “lift-off”, leading to growing nervousness in the markets. Although the prospect of an interest rate increase by the Fed has been widely anticipated ever since the taper tantrum in 2013, the uncertainty over its timing and possible impacts has in part contributed to episodes of market turbulence this year. After the eventual lift-off – whenever that may be – the markets will turn their attention to the pace of monetary tightening – or rate increases. The shift in market expectation over the pace will prompt volatility going forward. Hopefully I have not spoilt your morning by delving too deeply into volatility. But, let me stress this, monetary policy divergence will continue to be an underlying source of volatility in the global and regional financial markets. However, issues in financial markets are, by no means, disconnected from the real economy. Indeed, volatility arises from slow recovery, and timid growth outlook for the global economy, the so-called “new normal”. Looking ahead, the global economy is expected to grow only at a subdued pace as some major advanced economies are still grappling with the impacts of the global financial crisis and Emerging Market economies are faced with sluggish exports. Many economists have begun to refer to these conditions as a “new normal” for the global economy where global growth is weak, global merchandise trade shrinks and commodity prices remain low. An important factor behind this global dynamics may be attributed to China’s attempt to rebalance its economy, with more emphasis on domestic consumption, and less on investment and exports. While China is undergoing its economic transition, a slowdown in its growth rate is inevitable. The repercussions of China’s transition have been quite evident on the collapse of commodity prices, leaving many Emerging Market commodity exporters with current account deficits and massive sharp depreciations. Another crucial driver is the trend of “on-shoring” among major economies – leading to a structural change in the global supply chain – where countries like the US and China seek to source inputs domestically, rather than import intermediate goods from other countries. Thus, even if global growth were to be robust, it is unlikely that Emerging Market export growth would recover quite as strongly. I would certainly be remiss if I failed to mention another potential risk in Emerging Markets which could have impact on the real economy; that is a rapid buildup in Emerging Market corporate indebtedness. Ultra-loose global monetary policies have made it much easier for firms in Emerging Markets to raise funds – or borrow – especially from abroad. However, in the wake of tighter financial conditions, Emerging Market firms are facing greater difficulty to repay or roll over their debt. In summary, I have highlighted two key sources of volatility: first, continued excess liquidity amid diverging monetary policies, along with shifting market expectations about the future path of monetary policies; and second, the global economic transition to the “new normal” steady state. The process is ongoing, and will probably take some time – and it may not be smooth – before the new steady state is reached. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Ladies and gentlemen, Against the backdrop of such a volatile “new normal” world, I will now turn to the implications for Thailand. The impact will be realized on both our financial markets and the real economy. However, as I shall elaborate, the Thai economy has strong buffers that will make it relatively resilient to external shocks. Let me start by looking at implications for the financial markets and the exchange rate. In line with the trend of regional currencies, the Baht’s recent movement has been largely influenced by external factors. Any eminent signals of the Fed’s initial hikes, or worse-than-expected data coming out of China, would prompt capital outflows from Emerging Markets, thereby weighing down their currency values. Significant outflows could tighten financing conditions of domestic companies, in terms of both “cost of funds’ and “availability of funds”. Such interplay of several risk factors is a challenge for business managers and investors alike. However, international investors, like many of you here, have been increasingly selective in their portfolio decision. They no longer treat Emerging Markets collectively as a single asset class, but have shown to differentiate between Emerging Markets. As such, even though Emerging Markets may generally move in the same direction, the actual adjustments across individual markets have been uneven. In this context, the degree of Thai Baht depreciation ranks within the middle of the regional movements – and our currency also closely tracks regional peers – while the level of volatility is moderate relative to peers. This owes much to Thailand’s sound external position which provides cushions from volatility in the global financial markets, shielding the economy from any potential undesirable. An economy with strong buffers could be likened to a car with good suspension, which could smoothly go through a bumpy road of global financial markets volatility. In fact, on the external stability front, Thailand performs well across several metrics. The current account surplus is expected to top 6 per cent of GDP this year, amounting to more than 26 billion USD. Public debt stays rather stable at around 43 per cent of GDP. Our international reserves stand at almost 3 times of short-term debt, among the highest in the region. The non-resident security holdings in our bond market is lower than 10 per cent, while those in the Stock Exchange of Thailand account for around 30 per cent of market capitalization. Such relatively low levels of non-resident participation, compared to our peers, suggest limited exposure to future capital flight.  Corporate sector’s foreign debt also accounts for just 13 per cent of total corporate debt as of mid-2015. Moreover, most external debt is concentrated among large corporations. These large firms tend to manage their exchange rate exposure well, by utilizing financial hedging instruments. Careful risk management practice among Thai corporates and financial institutions has made them much more resilient to volatile movements of the exchange rate. The Thai banking system is also resilient, with a high level of capital buffer and stable loan growth, despite some deterioration in loan quality. Banks have closely monitored their customers, and have maintained a high level of loan loss provision as a buffer for bad loans. They are also well capitalized, with the capital adequacy ratio at 17.3 per cent and Tier-1 ratio at 14.4 per cent, among the highest in Asia. This suggests that our banking system has sufficient capital to shoulder unexpected loss, and accommodate credit expansion. In addition, their profitability will help enhance their capital base over time. Last but not least, inflationary pressure is stable due to a substantial fall in oil price from last year. Headline inflation, though currently in negative territory, is expected to gradually rise, and turn positive in 2016. Deflationary risks remain contained as demand continues to expand, and prices of most non-energy items remain stable or trend upwards. Such inflation trajectory is consistent with medium-term expectations of the public and the Bank of Thailand’s medium-term inflation target. Overall, the economy and our financial system show a good sign of stability and resiliency. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Let me now turn to implications for the real economy and begin by giving you some positive news, that is, the economy is likely to register stronger growth momentum next year. Tourism continues to show good prospects where the number of tourist arrivals is likely to exceed 30 million in 2016. Fiscal stimulus will continue to be a key growth driver. Public expenditure is expected to increase by more than 200 billion Baht from this year, providing support to the economic recovery, especially the construction sector. In the private sector, there are signs of investment expansion in construction, telecommunications, and alternative energy, among others. Although we may see export contraction in 2015, there are resilient spots in certain sectors. Exports to CLMV economies have experienced strong growth, and continue to show great potentials from which Thailand could capitalize. In fact, the share of exports to CLMV in our total exports is now on par with the share of our exports to the major trading partners such as the US, Europe, and Japan. Thailand’s exports to the US are also poised to become firmer as the US economy continues to see improvement in its recovery. Our exports of vehicle parts, electronic-appliance parts and electronics to the US have expanded in the past few months, and are likely to continue their growth momentum in 2016 in line with the US economic recovery. Nevertheless, some structural limitations still weigh on long-term growth. The recovery of the export sector will continue to be impeded by a shift in the global trade structure. Some of our products such as apparels and garments have seen a continuing decline in competitiveness, while some others are falling out of technological trend. Simply put, the Thai economy is like a car whose engine is in need of an overhaul. We need structural adjustments in growth drivers to enhance our competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. The private sector needs to invest in new production technology, and improve product quality in response to changes in global demand and consumer preferences. As Mohamed A. El-Erian, then CEO of PIMCO, once said “structural challenges require structural responses”.1 In this context, we welcome many new initiatives by the government to stimulate public and private investment and upgrade Thailand’s value chain. With the introduction of changes in the Board of Investment’s criteria for investment privileges, the government has geared up its effort in promoting high value added industries. It also announced Special Economic Zones in order to facilitate the growing networks of production, trade, and services initially with our neighboring countries. By expediting growth-enhancing infrastructure development and increasing ease of doing businesses, the government also helps promote crowding-in of private investment. Fiscal reforms are also in the pipeline in order to boost efficiency of the public spending, revenue collection, and other public administration. Reforms of state enterprises will also be vital to upgrading the country’s growth potential as they manage strategic assets of the country, and account for a large share of public capital expenditure. All in all, our car needs an engine overhaul. The government’s recent initiatives form an important part to uplift the car’s engine. In the meantime, I can assure you that we have a good suspension system to get through a bumpy road of market volatility ahead.  Ladies and gentlemen, At this juncture – during which Thailand is going through multi-dimensional reforms – the Bank of Thailand will do our part to safeguard stability, support the economic recovery, and facilitate long-term structural reforms.                                                 1  El-Erian, Mohamed A. “Navigating the New Normal in Industrial Countries.” Per Jacobsson Foundation Lecture. 10 Oct. 2010. Web. <https://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2010/101010.htm#P12_100>. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  There are three main elements of our policy navigation that I would like to share with you this morning. First, the Bank of Thailand will ensure ample liquidity in the system in order to accommodate the economic recovery. As policy normalization by the Fed is imminent, the risk of liquidity withdrawal from Emerging Markets increases. We anticipate limited impact on the overall Thai economy as markets have priced in the Fed’s initial hike. Besides, it is widely expected that the Fed fund rates would rise gradually from then on. As for now, despite the slow economic growth in Thailand, the overall credit to the private sector continues to expand at around 5 per cent. Furthermore, enterprises have issued a sizable amount of corporate bonds, leveraging on lower yields compared to last year. Commercial banks’ liquidity position is stable. All these are indications of favorable domestic financing conditions. Should a sudden reversal scenario occurs, the Bank of Thailand would make sure that liquidity will not become an impediment to economic recovery. The Bank of Thailand will also ensure that “cost of funds” is accommodative to the ongoing recovery. The two pre-emptive cuts in the policy interest rate earlier this year, in response to greater downside risks to growth, have eased domestic cost of funds. In addition, low inflationary pressure gives room for monetary policy to remain accommodative. This would ensure that the overall monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery. Nevertheless, we keep a cautious eye on risks to financial stability, especially under the prolonged low interest rate environment. Household debt, although it has stabilized, remains high in relation to GDP. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the low interest rate on the search for yield and long-term saving behavior. We are also vigilant on other pockets of risks which may have destabilizing effects on the economy, such as those in the real estate sector.  Let me now turn to the Bank of Thailand’s plan to handle an increased volatility of foreign exchange, which is the second element of our policy navigation. As a matter of fact, a certain degree of foreign exchange flexibility is desirable for the economy as it allows foreign exchange to act as a shock absorber and facilitates real economic adjustments. With weaker outlook of growth across Emerging Market economies, and the expected Fed’s policy rate hike, many Emerging Market currencies, including the Thai Baht, have depreciated. In case of Thailand, with relatively strong external financial position and well-managed foreign exchange risk exposure by public and private sectors alike, the risks from substantial foreign exchange debt exposure are currently contained. In addition, as part of the Capital Account Liberalization Master Plan, the Bank of Thailand announced earlier this year the relaxation of capital flows measures in a bid to promote more balanced fund flows, and greater flexibility in the foreign exchange markets. As the global financial markets will continue to be volatile in the near term, the Bank of Thailand thus remains focused on mitigating short-term excessive exchange rate volatility to cushion any impact it would have on the domestic financial conditions, and consequently the real economy. In the longer term, however, demand-management macroeconomic policy – be it fiscal or monetary – cannot be used to address structural problems successfully. As such, the Bank of Thailand is also geared towards financial sector development in order to facilitate the country’s long-term structural reforms. Financial sector development is the third element of our policy navigation. The Financial Sector Master Plan Phase III will aim for a “competitive, inclusive, connected, and sustainable” financial sector. Our vision is to have a competitive Thai financial sector which can support more diverse needs at a fair and undistorted price, promote regional trades and investments, while maintaining safety and soundness of the economy and the financial system. Today I hope to share with you some of the highlights and key milestones. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Five years from now, I foresee that the Thai financial landscape will look different from today, with more digital banking and electronic payment transactions, and increased competition from nonbanks and foreign players. The landscape will also contain innovative fintech companies who provide alternative solutions to both service providers and users such as data analytics, crowd funding, and product or price comparison services. Ultimately, competition will increase financial access, and lower transaction costs to the economy as a whole.  The Bank of Thailand will focus on the development of infrastructures and standards, while ensuring that rules and regulations are clear and supportive of innovation and efficiency. The new Payment Systems Act will unify all relevant regulations currently specified under different laws and enforced by various different agencies. In addition, the Bank of Thailand will support the government’s initiatives to promote nation-wide electronic payment system, including, for instance, the development of “Any ID” payment infrastructure, and the promotion of debit card usage for payment and transfer of welfare benefits. On connectivity, the establishment of Qualified ASEAN Banks, or QABs, will allow Thai banks to expand regionally, while welcoming foreign banks in the region to conduct businesses in Thailand. Bilateral negotiations with several countries have been planned and I expect some arrangements to be made by the end of next year. The Bank of Thailand will collaborate with other central banks in the region on the promotion of local currency settlements for trades and investments. The appointment of cross-currency dealers to act as clearing agents for the Baht and the Ringgit should be done by the first quarter of next year, while negotiations with other countries are ongoing. We are conscious of the rules and regulations which may hinder the development of regional trades and investments, and we are working carefully to remove obstacles without compromising stability objective. The joint initiatives by the government and the Bank of Thailand regarding treasury centers have generated interest among large companies applying for a license. These treasury centers can purchase or sell foreign currencies and hedging instruments for companies within their groups, thereby aiding in foreign exchange and liquidity risk management. Multinational companies, as well as large Thai corporations with overseas branches, could similarly benefit from lower transaction costs and improved liquidity management. On top of the tax incentives offered by the Board of Investment, International Headquarters established in Thailand will be eligible to provide financial management services to their affiliated companies, once granted the treasury center license. Rules and regulations also need to keep up with innovations in order to ensure safety and reliability of the financial system, and to maintain confidence of the public. To this end, the Bank of Thailand has been given a full responsibility in the regulation and supervision of the Specialized Financial Institutions or the SFIs, which amount for around 22 per cent of Thai financial institutions’ assets. In performing such roles, the Bank of Thailand will apply the internationally accepted principles and standards taking into account the mission, mandate, and current conditions of each SFI. The ultimate goal is to ensure safety, sustainability and soundness of SFIs’ operations, so that they can perform their core duties for the long-term benefit of the Thai society. Ladies and Gentlemen, It is clear that the world is currently changing fast. The global economy has now entered the new normal environment. Indeed, we expect to experience greater volatility as the world is in transition to a new steady state. Looking ahead, we must not fear volatility, but be mindful of associated risks and ways to manage them. So far, with robust cushions, Thailand has fared well from external shocks compared to other Emerging Market economies. This does not mean we can be complacent. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Our country is in need of reforms to address long-term structural problems, similar to having a more powerful engine, enabling us to reach our destination faster. Fortunately, though, our economy is currently equipped with strong buffers, similar to a robust suspension system in a car, smoothing our ride through bumpy roads. Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me assure you that the Bank of Thailand will do our part to ensure a stable and resilient macroeconomic landscape. We will accommodate changes, especially those in the financial system, which will put Thailand on a stronger footing and in a more competitive position. I am confident that Thailand will ride forward with the much more powerful engine it deserves. Thank you very much for your attention. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Minouche Shafik: Treading carefully Speech by Ms Minouche Shafik, Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking of the Bank of England, at the Institute of Directors, London, 14 December 2015. *      *      * I would especially like to thank Grellan McGrath for his help with the analysis and evidence in this speech. Comments from Alex Haberis, Andrew Hauser, Gareth Ramsay, Jon Relleen, Matt Waldron, Martin Weale and James Talbot are also gratefully acknowledged. Introduction In what is likely a first for a monetary policymaker, I would like to begin my speech today with a chart of the depth of tread on car tyres – as measured by the busiest tyre fitting station in the UK whom I recently visited in the South East. Generally speaking, the deeper the grooves are on a tyre, the better is its grip, performance and safety. When the recession hit in 2008, people began to delay replacing their tyres, implicitly accepting a deterioration in quality in the hope of saving on costs (Chart 1). What is surprising, however, is that although we are now into the seventh year of the recovery, the frequency with which drivers replace their tyres has not returned to pre-crisis levels. This illustrates quite nicely that although the economy is thankfully returning to normal, we cannot blithely assume that relationships which held in the past will automatically revert. Several stylised facts in macroeconomics – such as the idea that deeper recessions are followed by stronger recoveries, and the idea that productivity can be relied upon to increase over time around a long-standing trend – have been long since disproven by the nature of the recovery in the UK. And questions remain about the how the economy operates in the wake of the Great Recession that make the setting of monetary policy more challenging. In the rest of this speech I would like to put forward some thoughts on how one should approach decision taking in the face of such uncertainty. I will highlight three themes: proceeding with caution, considering all of the outcomes and retaining flexibility. I do so as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, though you should note that what follows are my own views and may not necessarily represent the views of the committee as a whole. I don’t think other members place quite so much weight on tyre tread depth as an indicator, and they probably wouldn’t thank me were it to be deemed a bellweather for interest rate decisions in the future. 1.  Proceed with caution It is now 81 months since Bank Rate was cut to its current level of 0.5%. It has taken a lot of hard work since then to generate the recovery we are now experiencing. I mean that quite literally: the weakness in productivity that we have witnessed means that much of the growth so far has been generated by increased hours worked rather than an increase in output per hour worked. Participation in the labour force has increased in recent years, as has average hours worked per week. Having demonstrated such flexibility, it is fitting that people are now beginning to enjoy the benefits of an increase in real wage growth.  For comparison, following the 1990s recession Bank Rate stayed at its trough for 7 months before being increased again, and the equivalent number following the 1980s recession was only 6 months. Indeed were one to look solely at measures of the real economy relative to their value when previous tightening cycles began, you would have expected the MPC to have already begun raising rates by now (Chart 2). And I must admit to getting a gentle ribbing at the dinner table when I come home after each monthly MPC meeting to say that I have voted for no change in Bank Rate once again. “All that work to decide to do nothing!” say my children. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  But there are good reasons for Bank Rate to have remained lower for longer this time. First among them is that it is not the absolute level of Bank Rate which matters, but where it is relative to some “equilibrium” rate that would maintain demand in line with supply in the economy and keep inflation close to target. The size and nature of the shocks that accompanied the financial crisis meant that this equilibrium level fell dramatically in 2008–09. So far, in fact, that even cutting Bank Rate to a record low of 0.5% was not enough to prevent the unemployment rate rising. And in order to head off a further deterioration in the economy, the MPC embarked on a programme of Quantitative Easing (QE) designed to further support the economy. In total, the MPC has purchased £375 billion of government bonds through a scheme we call the Asset Purchase Facility (APF). The persistence of those shocks and their after effects – including the need for ongoing fiscal consolidation, high levels of household indebtedness, and the subsequent events in the euro area – mean that the equilibrium rate is probably recovering only gradually. And I note at this point that at least some of this recovery in the equilibrium rate is likely to be matched by a fading of the stimulus from QE.1 The second reason why it is reasonable for Bank Rate not to have increased already is that the relationship between the real economy and inflation has not been as one would have expected: Chart 2 shows that while most real variables – such as unemployment – are at or beyond levels at which Bank Rate had been raised in the past, most nominal variables – such as wage growth and inflation – are below. For example, despite unemployment declining by three percentage points from its peak in 2008, headline inflation has fallen by five percentage points over the same period to a record low of –0.1%. This is the inverse of what one would have expected based simply on the historical negative correlation between inflation and unemployment.2 Of course much of this weakness in inflation is due to movements in commodity prices and the exchange rate. Since 2008 we have learned more about how movements in the exchange rate, in particular, affect inflation. Contrary to the body of literature developed during the period of Great Stability, changes in the exchange rate do have a large and persistent effect on inflation through their effect on import prices. That means that the 18% appreciation of sterling which began in early 2013 (as the prospects for the UK economy improved relative to those of our trading partners) is currently exerting significant downward pressure on inflation and is likely to continue to exert some downward pressure for several years to come as lower import costs pass through the supply chain.   But not all of the weakness in inflation can be explained by the price of things we import – a portion3 of the current deviation from target is due to weakness in domestically generated inflation. The biggest domestic driver of inflation is labour costs per unit of output, and in order to generate inflation at target in the medium term, wages would ordinarily need to grow about 2 to 3 percentage points more quickly than productivity growth. The data are noisy, but over the period since the recovery began, that wedge – known as the unit wage cost – has averaged just 1% (Chart 3).  Of course for much of that period the weakness of wages relative to productivity was consistent with the presence of slack in the labour market. But something of a puzzle started to emerge in 2014 when – despite a significant narrowing of that slack – wage growth                                                 1  As time passes the effect of the early tranches of asset purchases on the level of output diminishes. The peak impact on GDP of asset purchases probably occurred during 2013. Since then, the support to the level of activity from asset purchases has likely been waning. At the same time, the value of the £375bn stock of purchased assets has declined relative to nominal GDP (from 22.5% to 20.1%) as the latter has increased.  2  Over the period 1971 to 2008 the correlation between unemployment and inflation was –0.2. 3  As best we can tell around ½ percentage point. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  seemed slow to pick up. The early signs were that 2015 would be more promising, but the rate of wage growth seems to have levelled off again in the most recent data.  Wage data can be volatile in the short run, and this recent pause may prove to be more noise than signal. But there are several plausible explanations for why wage growth might have levelled off more recently.  • The first is quite simply that the number of hours worked per person per week has levelled off in the most recent data, and even started to decline. This could have a temporary flattening effect on the growth rate of wages earned per week. • The second is the nature of the growth in employment that we have seen. It has been unusually skewed towards employees with less experience and educational attainment and in occupations that tend to attract lower levels of pay. These compositional effects tend to push down on starting salaries, though that shouldn’t affect future wage growth prospects.  • A third explanation, and one we hear from the Bank’s network of agents, is that the low level of headline inflation may be limiting upward pressure on pay in some cases as relatively small nominal pay awards are sufficient to increase real incomes. If this is an important factor, the lags between headline inflation and the determination of pay awards mean it could increase the persistence of weak wage growth for some time to come. This too should ultimately fade as the effects of energy and the exchange rate on inflation dissipate. • A fourth potential explanation is that the severity of the recession and the increase in uncertainty that accompanied it has had a lasting impact on the decisions people take and the tradeoffs they make – just as it seems to have done in the market for tyres. It may be, for example, that with the recession still reasonably fresh in their memories, workers are marginally more reluctant to push for the kinds of pay settlements they would have been used to before 2008, or marginally less willing to take the step of switching employers in order to gain a higher salary. In deciding how to vote in monetary policy meetings each month, I look across a wide range of indicators. There are many signs that the economy is normalising – the labour market is tightening, consumption growth is solid, investment is recovering, and even productivity growth is showing tentative signs of a return. And although the downward pressure on inflation from movements in energy prices and the exchange rate are proving persistent, they will not have a permanent effect on inflation.  But, there is residual uncertainty about the relationship between the real economy and inflation – something economists refer to as “model uncertainty” – which in this instance augurs for caution in setting monetary policy.4 The most likely outcome is that wage growth will soon resume its recovery, but there are alternative states of the world in which it takes longer for that to happen. So I judge it prudent to tread carefully, and refrain from voting for an increase in Bank Rate until I am convinced that wage growth will be sustained at a level consistent with inflation returning to target.                                                  4  The effect of uncertainty in the setting of monetary policy is much discussed. Brainard (1967) shows that when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their actions on the economy, it is appropriate to move more cautiously than if the impact of policy is certain – a strategy known as gradualism. Data uncertainty is another reason why policymakers may adopt a gradualist approach. One common finding is that when data are noisier, a less aggressive response is desirable (Rudebusch, 2001; Orphanides, 2003). In addition, more recently, Evans et al (2015) have argued for delaying lift-off in the face of uncertainty about the strength of the recovery, given a view that there are asymmetric costs associated with the zero lower bound. However, the finding that policy should respond more gradually in the face of uncertainty is not a general one.  For example, Söderström (2002) suggests that there is uncertainty about monetary policy’s ability to return inflation in the medium term, that may call for a pre-emptive response.  
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  2.  Consider all of the outcomes In the presence of uncertainty, it is wise not to put all of one’s eggs in one basket, but rather to hedge against undesirable states of the world. That is something that market participants know well, and it means that financial asset prices reflect not only what is thought to be the most likely outcome, but also the full range of other possible outcomes and the probabilities attached to them. So what is implied by a literal interpretation of markets – including government bond and interest rate swap markets – is not necessarily a true reflection of what participants expect is going to happen.5 For example, at the time we were producing the November Inflation Report, the market yield curve implied the first increase in Bank Rate would come in March 2017, and that it would reach 1¼% by the end of 2018. A literal interpretation of this would suggest that in 33 of the coming 36 months the majority of MPC members would have to return home to their respective dinner tables reporting they voted for no change in Bank Rate.6  An alternative interpretation is that the true expectation of market participants is for Bank Rate to increase more quickly than that, but that they are particularly worried about downside risks and are happy to accept a lower expected return in exchange for insurance against bad outcomes.7 This would be consistent with the risks to the world economy that have come to the fore over the past year as emerging economies grapple with the twin challenges of transitioning to slower potential output growth and lower commodity prices. Although the direct trade links between emerging economies and the UK are relatively small, the indirect effects of a more dramatic emerging market slowdown through confidence and financial channels could be significant.  I suspect this latter interpretation is closer to the reality. Personally speaking, should the downside risks from the world economy fail to materialise, and absent further shocks, once wage growth has returned to a level consistent with inflation returning to target I would expect the economy to warrant a path for Bank Rate that increases more quickly than implied by the market yield curve used to condition the November Inflation Report. I think it is interesting to note that surveys of economic forecasters – a more direct measure of the expected future path of interest rates – show expectations for a faster pace of increases in Bank Rate. Having said that, I think all agents, and all members of the MPC, expect the future path to be gradual and limited.  3.  Retain flexibility Of course one can never know exactly what the future holds. So when the time does come to raise Bank Rate, it will be important to retain the flexibility to change course if needs be, either by tightening policy more quickly than originally envisaged or by being prepared to loosen again. Were it required to respond to unforeseen events, the MPC would have two tools at its immediate disposal: Bank Rate and QE.  Past experience gives us a good dataset from which to gain an understanding of how changes in policy rates transmit to the economy. Based on a rich literature of international estimates over the period since inflation targeting began, the peak impact on inflation is generally estimated to occur with a lag of between 18 and 24 months, although it begins to                                                 5  See Shafik (2015) and Broadbent (2015) for more on this issue. 6  Though should proposed legislation pass, the number of MPC meetings per year will reduce from 12 to 8, in line with the recommendations of the Warsh Review (Warsh, 2014) 7  The market curve represents the mean of the priced distribution of interest rates. Consideration of risks can cause this whole distribution to move relative to true expectations. Risks can also affect the shape of the distribution, though Dison and Elliot (2015) found that the shape of the distribution is currently being heavily influenced by the proximity of Bank Rate to the effective lower bound. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  have some effect within the first year. Comparisons between the US and the UK indicate that the transmission mechanism may be a bit quicker in the UK than in the US, perhaps reflecting the prevalence of longer term fixed rate mortgages in the US. However, these estimates are generally based on the experience of changing policy when rates are positive – relatively little is known about the transmission of negative interest rates which have only begun to be used quite recently in parts of Europe.  As for QE, we can be confident that it was effective in reducing the severity of the impact of the financial crisis. For example analysis by Bank staff suggests that QE had a peak impact on the level of real GDP of around 2.5%,8 and helped limit the long term impact of the recession on the economy. However, our knowledge of how QE affects the economy is based only on what we can learn from its use since 2009 – a much more limited sample than that available for changes in Bank Rate. And it may well be that were it used in different circumstances its effect could be quite different.  In light of the uncertainty about the transmission of unconventional monetary policies, the MPC has expressed a preference to use Bank Rate as the marginal instrument for monetary policy when the time comes to tighten. Specifically, we have said that we do not expect to reduce the stock of QE either through outright sales or by ceasing reinvestment of principal until Bank Rate has reached a level from which it can be materially cut. Choosing to focus this part of the tightening cycle solely on Bank Rate will at the margin imply a faster increase than would have been the case were we to combine it with a tightening via a reduction in the stock of QE as well. This will be more likely to give us the ability to respond to an adverse shock using Bank Rate rather than tools which are inherently less flexible and with which we are less familiar.  Based on past experience, the MPC currently judges that the level of Bank Rate which would provide room for a material reduction is around 2%. As Chart 4 shows, 67 of the 106 loosening cycles since the Bank was founded in 1694 were achieved by reducing Bank Rate by 2 percentage points or less.  You could argue that there is a case for choosing a level higher than “around 2%”. To do so, however, would extend the horizon over which we would be expected to reach that level, and by implication extend the horizon over which the stock of QE would be held on behalf of the MPC. Given the gradual pace at which the equilibrium rate may rise, such an extension could be very long.  It has never been the intention of the MPC to retain indefinitely the stock of assets purchased as part of QE.9 Were it to do so, there is a risk that maintaining such a large stock of government debt as a monetary policy tool might blur some external perceptions of the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy. That could lead to doubts over the independence with which we were pursuing our objective of price stability, which would represent a significant step backward. Decisions on the stock of gilts held in the APF have always been made solely by the MPC in the sole pursuit of its monetary policy objectives mandated by Parliament and that should always remain the case. Central bank independence has been shown to bring great economic benefit in the form of lower and more stable inflation – a result that has stood the test of the financial crisis and is something we should treasure. 10                                                  8  Joyce, M, Tong, M and Woods, R (2011), “The United Kingdom’s quantitative easing policy: design, operation and impact”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Vol. 51, No. 3, pages 200–12. 9  For example, in his 2009 letter to the Chancellor requesting the MPC be able to use the Asset Purchase Facility for monetary policy purposes, the then Governor, Mervyn King said “At some future date, I would expect that the MPC would wish to exit from the strategy of buying assets and would wish to reduce the amount of assets held under the Asset Purchase Facility.”  10  See for example Alesina and Summers (1993), Klomp and De Haan (2009) and King (2013). 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Conclusion Let me sum up. We are still learning how the post-crisis economy behaves, and some relationships in the data have proven slow to reassert themselves or may have changed. The recent plateau in wage growth despite the ongoing recovery is one example, and I will wait until I am convinced that wage growth will be sustained at a level consistent with inflation returning to target before voting for an increase in Bank Rate. In this sense, I will proceed with caution.  But once I am convinced, absent further shocks, I can see Bank Rate rising more quickly than the path implied by the market curve at the time of the last Inflation Report. That is not to say I don’t understand the shape of the yield curve – market participants must consider all of the possible outcomes when making their decisions, and the yield curve could be weighed down by worries about the world. Whatever the outcome, it will be important to maintain flexibility to respond to new data and events. The flexibility the MPC has had to pursue its target independently since 1997 has brought great benefits. The MPC has also shown flexibility in developing new instruments such as QE to achieve its goals. Similarly, as monetary policy begins to tighten, the MPC will be focussed on Bank Rate as the marginal tool of monetary policy, given it’s more flexible in nature than QE.  And occasionally, we might also consider tyre tread depth, just to see if the post crisis economy reverts to pre-crisis patterns or whether we need to think about the future a bit differently.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Per Jansson: Time to improve the inflation target? Speech by Mr Per Jansson, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Handelsbanken, Stockholm, 3 December 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank Mikael Apel for helping me with this speech. Since the global financial crisis, the world economy has entered an unusually uncertain and turbulent period. The recovery following the crisis has progressed surprisingly slowly in many countries, the European monetary union has been periodically exposed to major strains and there are currently a great number of questions surrounding the developments in China and several other emerging market economies, to name just a few examples. When a storm is raging around you, it is a major advantage to be travelling in a reliable and robust vessel. In terms of an economy, this often means having well-designed economic policy frameworks and clear and credible ground rules which provide robustness and stability. I would argue that the Swedish economy has been such a vessel for a long time now, and that this has been highly beneficial to us, both from a longer-term perspective as well as during and after the financial crisis.  It is evident that the Swedish economy is currently regarded as fairly stable when studying the difference in long-term yields in relation to Germany. This difference has been small for almost twenty years, and has occasionally even been negative (see Figure 1). When compared to how the situation was previously, the difference is quite striking.  Fundamental reforms after the 1990s crisis provided stability This is something which in many respects we can thank the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s for. The Lindbeck Commission, appointed in December 1992, noted that the Swedish crisis of the 1990s was not just a result of an unlucky combination of an international economic downturn, overly generous lending and individual policy errors, but in fact had much deeper roots.1 In their assessment it was to a large extent a “political and institutional crisis”, which exposed weaknesses in the way the political system worked. What they meant by this was that there was an underlying “systemic error” in the Swedish economy – a built-in bias towards systematically overly expansionary economic policy, which meant chronic problems with excessively high inflation, recurring cost crises and growing national debt. The Lindbeck Commission therefore advocated a policy which followed certain predetermined principles, or a “rule-based” policy.2 Several important institutional and structural changes were implemented in connection with the crisis and in the following years to create greater stability and sustainability in economic policy. One of the more comprehensive reforms was that monetary policy was more directly focused on keeping inflation low and stable, instead of, as previously, indirectly by maintaining a fixed exchange rate. Sweden thereby became one of the first countries to adopt inflation targeting. The price stability target was later written into the law and the interest rate decisions were delegated to an independent Executive Board. Another very important change was the creation of a fiscal policy framework with an amended budget process. This framework and the new process aimed to get a grip on the evolution of public expenditures while also leading                                                  1  The Economic Commission (1993). 2  A debate about this had been taking place for a while at that point. The Swedish Centre for Business and Policy Studies (SNS) had been advocating a so-called norm-based stabilisation policy since 1985, see Heikensten and Vredin (2012) for an overview. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches to an average surplus in terms of net lending. The overall aim was to ensure that fiscal policy would have the desired long-term orientation. Flexible inflation targeting preferable – but improvements not ruled out But even though these and other changes have made the Swedish economy more reliable and resilient to shocks, we too have been affected by the events of the past few years. The global financial crisis and surprisingly low inflation have meant that a number of previously accepted truths have begun to be called into question, and led to a debate about whether the economic policy framework developed prior to the financial crisis should be modified or potentially even replaced.  My view here is completely clear: it is important for us to think very carefully before we make any comprehensive changes to the Swedish economic policy frameworks. We know little about what the world will look like in the future, and we should be careful not to casually abandon something which has essentially worked well. It is easy to forget previous problems as time passes, and to take for granted that certain things are simply working. This is a dangerous approach, however, which can lead to setbacks. Dismantling a framework can be done quickly, but building one up takes a long time and often involves major adjustment costs. In terms of the monetary policy framework, I am convinced that the flexible inflation targeting pursued by the Riksbank and most other central banks today will continue to be the most effective approach for the foreseeable future. This does not mean, however, that I oppose all forms of change and necessarily think that everything should remain exactly as it is today. If we want something to endure, we must be prepared to change it. To continue with the metaphor I used at the beginning: it is important to constantly maintain the vessel and make any adjustments and improvements required for it to keep functioning well, even under new circumstances.3  I would today like to highlight a few areas of the Swedish monetary policy framework about which there are grounds to open up a discussion, based on the experiences we have gathered over some twenty years of inflation targeting.4 It is perhaps mainly the experiences gained after the financial crisis which have increased the need for a serious discussion. If this discussion were to eventually conclude that it is appropriate to make certain changes within the areas I raise, then this would not have drastic consequences for the monetary policy framework as such. Rather, it would mean adjustments and improvements which could be accommodated well within the existing framework of flexible inflation targeting. Before I continue, I would like to underscore one important thing: the members of the Executive Board always give their own views in their speeches. The ideas I express here are therefore entirely my own. The issues I raise are issues we in the Executive Board have discussed off and on, but it is an ongoing discussion and we have not yet drawn any conclusions. What I say here should therefore not be interpreted as the Riksbank's official view on these issues. I would like to highlight two aspects of the monetary policy framework – the target variable and a potential interval, or band, surrounding the target.                                                  3  In Canada, this work has been formalised in that the monetary policy framework is reviewed every five years. This results in an “Inflation-Control Agreement” between the Bank of Canada and the government. 4  The evaluation of Swedish monetary policy by Marvin Goodfriend and Mervyn King on behalf of the Committee of Finance (Riksdagen, 2014), which is assessing different areas of the monetary policy framework, will undoubtedly further stimulate the discussion. This evaluation will be presented in January. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Important to follow the international debate One aspect which has been debated a great deal both in Sweden and internationally, and which I do not intend to highlight here, is the level of the inflation target. That issue has recently been discussed quite thoroughly by some of my colleagues, and I do not have much more to add.5 I would just like to say briefly that if we are going to discuss a change in the target level, then I, like my colleagues, have greater sympathy for the argument in the international debate that central banks should raise their inflation targets than for the argument in the Swedish debate that the inflation target should be lowered. The main reason for this is the motive usually stated as the main justification for a rise – that if the target is too low, or if inflation expectations are permanently too low for some other reason, then the policy rate will hit its lower limit more often and for longer periods.6 This means that monetary policy in the future would find it harder to counteract a recession. However, it is too early today to draw the conclusion that 2 per cent is too low a level for the inflation target, and the discussion needs to continue.7 Nor do I intend to say anything about the issue debated both in Sweden and internationally as to whether monetary policy should be used to actively attempt to counteract the accumulation of financial imbalances. I also do not intend to comment on the principally international debate as to whether inflation targeting really is the best monetary policy framework, or whether a target for nominal GDP would be preferable, for example. As I have already mentioned, I think that flexible inflation targeting is the preferable framework, both now and for the foreseeable future.  In general, however, it is important for us to follow the fairly intense international discussion about how monetary policy should best be conducted. We want to avoid ending up with rushed and home-cooked solutions that we eventually regret and find it difficult to change. However, the areas I will focus on here – the target variable and a potential interval – primarily refer to the Swedish debate and are things that we ought to be able to change, should we wish to, without a risk of major negative consequences.   The target variable Let me therefore begin by discussing the target variable. Since the inflation target was introduced in January 1993, it has been formulated in terms of the consumer price index, CPI. The reason the CPI was chosen as the target variable was mainly due to the fact that it was, and still is, the most well-known measure of price developments in Sweden. The CPI also has the advantages that it includes a large part of household consumption, it is published regularly and has well-known statistical properties. However, using the CPI as a target variable has occasionally led to a number of pedagogical difficulties, not least in recent times. The reason for this is that household mortgage rates are included in the CPI. For example, when the Riksbank lowers the interest rate to bring inflation up, mortgage rates will fall. The short-term effect on the CPI therefore heads in the “wrong direction”, that is, the interest rate cut makes inflation fall further (see Figure 2).                                                  5  See, for example, Skingsley (2015) and Flodén (2015). 6  When the inflation target is very low, say, 1 or 0 per cent, inflation will vary around that level. The nominal interest rate will also be lower on average for a lower target. The lower the interest rate is in normal conditions, the less scope there is to lower it before it hits its lower limit and can no longer be used to stimulate the economy. Another problem with permanently low inflation is that because it has proved to be difficult to lower nominal wages in practice, it can be difficult to adjust real wages between individuals at a company and between different sectors. 7  Simulations by Dorich, Labelle, Lepetyuk and Mendes (2015) using a model for the Canadian economy indicate that a target of 2 per cent leads to a result that is almost as good as if the target were raised to 3 or 4 per cent, given that the policy rate can be complemented by quantitative easing as well as active and credible supporting communication. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Major direct impact of interest rate changes makes Swedish CPI unique This direct impact of interest rate changes on inflation is quite unique to Sweden. The reason for the effect is that we include household mortgage costs in the CPI in a slightly different way than most other countries with inflation targets. More specifically, we attempt to measure households’ costs for living in an owner-occupied property, where interest expenditure is an important component.8 The CPI is calculated according to roughly the same principles in Canada, for example, but in practice the interest rate changes have a much smaller impact on the CPI there than here in Sweden.9 In Australia and New Zealand, interest rate changes also previously had a major direct impact on the CPI, but the method for calculating CPI changed in both countries at the end of the 1990s in a way that eliminated such effects.10 They now apply a method which is principally based on following price developments of new housing, a so-called net acquisition approach. In other countries, for example the United States and Norway, costs for owner-occupied housing are approximated to the cost for renting a comparable property – and this is far less affected by interest rate changes. In the euro area and the United Kingdom, the target is formulated in terms of the HICP index (harmonised index for consumer prices) which does not include costs for owner-occupied housing, only operating costs.11 As Swedish CPI inflation has this characteristic, the Riksbank has, since the introduction of the inflation target, calculated several different measures of inflation and has also regularly let inflation indices other than the CPI guide interest rate decisions. The price index which has played the biggest role in recent years is the CPIF, or the CPI with a fixed interest rate. Unlike the CPI, the CPIF is not directly affected by changes in mortgage rates. CPIF inflation, with energy prices also discounted at times, has functioned as a “steering” variable in such a way that the Riksbank has normally aimed for it to be close to 2 per cent within the forecasting horizon.  Major interest rate changes lead to substantial and long-term effects on the CPI Despite this, the target has been formulated in terms of the CPI. As interest rates sometimes go up and sometimes down, the idea has been that the differences in inflation according to the CPI and the CPIF will level out over time. The long-run average of the two inflation measures will be the same, and if the Riksbank aims to stabilise CPIF inflation around 2 per cent then CPI inflation will on average also end up at the target. Deviations between both measures were not expected to be too great or lasting, and if they were to occasionally differ and CPI inflation were far below the target, then this could be dealt with by clear communication from the Riksbank. So it was thought at least.  However, even though the “long term” in this case is not so long that we will all be dead, to paraphrase Keynes, it is long enough for the difference between the CPI and CPIF to pose problems. Interest rate developments over the past few years have led to major deviations between the CPI and the CPIF, both upwards and downwards (see Figure 3). The period of cuts which began in December 2011, and which is currently the longest continuous period of                                                  8  See Johansson (2015) for a description of how interest rate changes impact the Swedish CPI and a review of the methods used for measuring costs for owner-occupied housing in different countries.  9  See Palmqvist (2013).  10  See Reserve Bank of Australia (1998) and Reserve Bank of New Zealand (1999).  11  In 2003 the United Kingdom decided to rename HICP CPI. The EU's statistics office Eurostat is currently investigating the possibility of including owner-occupied housing costs in the HICP in line with the net acquisition model, but it is unclear whether or when this will happen. It is worth pointing out – against the background of proposals of taking rising housing prices into account in the inflation measure – that changes in housing prices in all methods only have a limited impact on the index, or no impact at all. How monetary policy should be affected by changes in housing prices (or other asset prices) is therefore an issue which must principally be handled separately from the actual measure of inflation.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 interest-rate cuts since the inflation target was introduced, has contributed to CPI inflation falling substantially below CPIF inflation and remaining near zero for three years. Correspondingly, CPI inflation will be pushed upwards and exceed the target when the repo rate approaches historically more normal levels in the future. An extremely low rate of increase in CPI inflation therefore tends to be followed sooner or later by an unusually high rate of increase, and these periods can sometimes be relatively protracted. This could look something like Figure 4, for example. One could say that major, protracted interest rate movements lead to substantial and long-term surges in CPI inflation – more substantial and long-term than we previously believed would be the case. Risk of misleading image and uncertainty about the inflation target This has caused some difficulties, and will likely continue to do so in the future, not least in terms of monetary policy communication. One problem is that the focus on CPI inflation – which in itself is not entirely unnatural – has led to flashy headlines in the media from time to time over the years about Sweden being in a state of deflation. When CPI inflation is negative, this is obviously correct in a purely technical sense, but the story behind the headline often fails to explain that it is to a large extent a result of the Riksbank lowering the interest rate, and that CPIF inflation typically is considerably higher. Foreign commentators in particular have therefore often come to the conclusion that the Swedish economy is in a highly critical situation and that the state of the real economy is deflationist as well, with very weak growth in production and employment. It cannot be ruled out either that this kind of media reporting can, at least to some extent, affect economic sentiment. It is of course unfortunate if this kind of misleading image takes hold simply because the Swedish CPI is calculated in the way it is. A potentially more serious problem is that even if CPIF inflation were reasonably close to 2 per cent, the formal target variable, CPI inflation, could be relatively far from the target for fairly long periods of time. Even if upward and downward deviations were to level out in the really long term, there could be long periods where CPI inflation deviates from the target – long enough for there to be a risk of confidence in the inflation target being shaken. To put it differently, participants in the economy could begin to question whether the Riksbank will truly also stabilise CPI inflation around the target by stabilising CPIF inflation around 2 per cent. And they would have fairly good grounds for doing so, not just based on past events but also if we look ahead. If we assume in Figure 4 that CPIF inflation will continue to be around 2 per cent after 2018, then CPI inflation would overshoot the target for a long time, based on reasonable assumptions about the development of the repo rate. Even if the repo rate did not continue to rise to levels considered normal before the crisis, but instead slowed to the average of 2.3 per cent seen over the period 1998–2015, CPI inflation would overshoot the target for around five years in total. If the repo rate did continue to rise, it would take even longer, all things being equal, for CPI inflation to return to 2 per cent.12 Of course it is problematic if the formal target variable deviates from the target for such long periods, even if this is a result of a conscious policy. Time to start a discussion about the target variable Set against this background, it is my belief that it may again be time to open up a discussion about the target variable. One option, which I personally find appealing and fairly natural, is to face up to the consequences and allow an inflation measure upon which interest rate changes do not have such a direct impact to not only be the “steering” variable but also the target variable. The indices which come to mind first in that case are the CPIF and HICP. One                                                  12  The exact course of the policy rate path is obviously crucial in terms of how much and how long CPI inflation will deviate from CPIF inflation. A policy rate rise implemented more quickly leads, all things being equal, to a greater but briefer deviation than an equally large but more protracted policy rate rise. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches advantage of the latter index is that it is an internationally comparable measure, but the differences compared with the CPIF are quantitatively not particularly large.  It is worth pointing out that this would not lead in practice to any particularly major change in monetary policy. After all, the Riksbank already typically aims for a CPIF inflation rate of around 2 per cent within the forecasting horizon. It is also worth emphasising that the purpose of changing the target variable would not be to make it easier for the Riksbank to hit the inflation target. That would hopefully be a positive side-effect, but the main purpose would be to rectify the problems with the CPI as a target variable which have gradually become more and more evident. Naturally, a change of target variable must be preceded by a thorough analysis of how and when the replacement would take place and what consequences it could potentially have. My aim here is simply to highlight the issue and initiate a discussion.  Of course, a new target variable would not solve every problem and be the only measure the Riksbank would have to look at. We would need to continue to analyse different measures of inflation to get as complete a picture as possible. For instance, as oil prices, and energy prices in general, often vary greatly, there are reasons on many occasions to study inflation measures where these prices are excluded. However, I believe the biggest problem would still be solved if interest expenditure were excluded from the target variable once and for all.  Before I continue, I would like to make a comment about the target variable in relation to wage formation. This is connected to my assertion that the significance of interest expenditure for the CPI means that an extremely low rate of increase in CPI inflation tends to be followed sooner or later by an unusually high rate of increase. As we have seen, these periods can also be fairly protracted. If wage formation places a lot of focus on the current level of CPI inflation, I see a risk that this could create instability in the wage formation system. A situation similar to the one in the 1970s and 80s could then ultimately occur, whereby wage developments varied substantially from year to year depending on the current inflation rate, which also varied extensively. It would therefore be better if wage formation were based on a less volatile inflation measure than CPI inflation.13 A new monetary policy target variable could hopefully take on that role. A band surrounding the target When the General Council of the Riksbank decided to introduce an inflation target of 2 per cent in January 1993, it also decided that there should be a tolerance band surrounding this target of 1 percentage point both above and below.14 The aim was to clarify that the Riksbank does not have the ability to control inflation exactly in the short term, but that it also aims to limit deviations from the target – that it does not intend to “tolerate” deviations greater than 1 percentage point. The size of the interval was determined by what intuitively appeared to be reasonable. It was not possible to rely on any past experience as the monetary policy regime was entirely new and inflation had varied considerably during the old regime which had a fixed exchange rate. The Riksbank expected that inflation would now vary less, but was unsure as to how much.                                                  13  It could be argued that wage formation should be based on inflation always being 2 per cent, as periods below and above the target should cancel each other out in the long term. However, if inflation deviates significantly from the target for a long time, it can be difficult for wage setters to stick to this. Therefore, wage formation would be facilitated if the inflation target were formulated in term of CPIF or HICP inflation rather than in terms of CPI inflation. 14  Until 1999, when the Executive Board was established, monetary policy decisions were made by the General Council of the Riksbank. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 The interval remained a part of the monetary policy framework for a long time, but was finally abolished in 2010. The reason for this was that the Riksbank assessed at that time that it had fulfilled its role and was not serving any practical function. In the memorandum published in connection with the decision, it was noted that: “There is considerable understanding for the fact that inflation commonly deviates from the target and that the deviations are sometimes larger than 1 percentage point. Inflation can thus be outside the tolerance interval without threatening the credibility of the inflation target. Such deviations have proved to be a natural part of monetary policy.”15   So as a few years now have passed, it may be justified to evaluate the period where there has been no interval. Personally, I am not entirely sure that it has been as trouble-free as the Riksbank expected, even though I too thought that the decision to remove the interval was quite natural when it was taken.  Debate about the interval – but a different kind than before? The question of whether the inflation target should be surrounded by an interval has recently gained some attention again in the Swedish debate. There appears to be differing views on what function an interval would fulfil, however. The previous tolerance band was first and foremost a pedagogical tool intended to illustrate that we must accept certain, though not too large, deviations from the inflation target of 2 per cent – the point target the Riksbank is always aiming for.  The interval that a number of commentators have been advocating recently appears to be of a different kind, however. They would prefer what could be called a target range, or in other words the target itself is 2 percentage points wide and not an exact figure.16 A target range implies that monetary policy is focused on inflation falling within the range of 1–3 per cent within a couple of years, but there is no requirement for it to reach the midpoint of the interval. Inflation of just over 1 per cent or marginally under 3 per cent is equivalent to inflation of 2 per cent. If there were a tolerance band, inflation of just over 1 per cent, or below 3 per cent, instead would be “tolerable” if unforeseen events meant that inflation ended up there, but it would not be something to consciously aim for. The idea that many commentators seem to have is that a target range would mean the Riksbank would feel less forced to bring inflation up to 2 per cent, which in turn would mean that monetary policy would not need to be as expansionary and the risks linked to such a policy could be mitigated. Difficult to pursue another policy even with an interval I would like to point out here, without commenting on the pros and cons of a target range in general terms, that this idea appears to be based in part on a misunderstanding of the motives behind the Riksbank’s policy. The reason the Riksbank is eager to get inflation to rise is not that we have a rigid fixation with achieving exactly 2 per cent inflation all the time. It is due to the fact that the period in which inflation has been below the target has gradually become longer, and that long-term inflation expectations have shown a falling trend and still remain below the target. For the reasons I noted a moment ago when discussing the level of the inflation target – that the interest rate hits its lower limit more easily and it becomes difficult to counteract a recession – it is important to avoid inflation and inflation expectations falling too far and get stuck at a level that is too low.  This would be the case even if we had had a target range of 1–3 per cent. Inflation and inflation expectations which creep downwards and get stuck near the lower limit of this range could be                                                  15  The Riksbank (2010). 16  See for example Fromlet (2015) and Lars Jonung in Svenska Dagbladet (2015). 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches as problematic as if the inflation target itself had been lowered. It is thus difficult to see that the Riksbank would have pursued a notably different policy even if there had been a target range, or that there would be grounds to adjust the current policy if a target range were to be introduced tomorrow.17  This is probably also the reason why central banks in countries which have a formal target range, such as Canada and New Zealand, usually aim for the midpoint of the range.18 After all, the safest way to prevent inflation and inflation expectations beginning to slide out of the range is to attempt to keep them in the middle of it. In this sense, there is no great practical difference between a target range and a point target with a tolerance band. Interval good for illustrating uncertainty I believe there are still grounds for discussing whether the Swedish monetary policy framework should be complemented once again by some kind of interval. As I see it, the main reason would be to remind people that monetary policy is pursued under considerable uncertainty, and that the Riksbank is not able to fine-tune the economy and inflation. It could be seen as paradoxical that it is needed, as the justification for the interval being removed before was that there was widespread understanding for this being the case. My impression, however, is that there is a lingering perception that monetary policy is a tool with a relatively high level of precision and that most things can be managed using well-calibrated policy rate changes. In the discussion about monetary policy, many seem to assume that there are relatively precise relations between the interest rate, inflation and unemployment, a perspective that does not receive much empirical support.  This is something to which the Riksbank itself probably has contributed somewhat, as some analyses in our reports could have given this impression. For example, we used to regularly present different interest rate scenarios in the monetary policy reports which were based on the effects of policy rate changes on the economy and inflation being calculated relatively mechanically and with seemingly good precision. The fact that the effects of monetary policy are surrounded by major uncertainty and cannot be calculated with good precision is something we probably need to remind people of more or less constantly, and in that case an interval can be useful. The most obvious approach in this case would perhaps be to reintroduce a tolerance band around the inflation target. If this route is chosen, it is important of course that it is given a practical significance and fulfils some kind of function, in contrast to the interval removed in 2010. One possibility could be that the Riksbank undertakes to explain in a special report why inflation has ended up outside the interval whenever this occurs – in roughly the same way as the Bank of England writes an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. On the one hand, this could lead to deviations outside the band being seen as slightly dramatic, but on the other hand it could also make deviations within the interval less dramatic. I believe the latter would be an advantage seen against the background of what I have just said about monetary policy not being able to fine-tune inflation.  Naturally it is also important that the breadth of any band matches the variations in inflation in a meaningful way. It could be questioned whether this was the case for the previous tolerance                                                  17  One possibility could be that long-term inflation expectations would have been anchored better if there had been an interval. The debate about target deviations could possibly have been less intense for example, which in turn could have led to a smaller fall in expectations. This is far from certain, however. 2 per cent does not represent a clear guideline in terms of a target interval, and regardless of whether the interval is a target or tolerance interval, inflation has now been so far below the lower limit for such a long time that expectations would likely have been severely affected in any case. 18  The Bank of Canada aims for inflation to be “at the 2 per cent midpoint of a target range of 1 to 3 per cent over the medium term”, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand aims to get inflation near “the 2 percent target midpoint” on average. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 band. It is worth emphasising that the choice of target variable is important when choosing the breadth of the band. A reflection from Figure 3 is that the interval of 1–3 per cent would have much better suited a target variable upon which interest rate changes do not have a direct effect – that is to say CPIF or HICP inflation – than was the case for CPI inflation. The periods outside the interval for these measures are more short-lived and the deviations are smaller. A number of reports would still have needed to be written, but there would have been fewer than with the CPI, and above all they would have contained more meaningful explanations as to why inflation was outside the tolerance band than that households' interest expenditure in the CPI has been influenced by the Riksbank's altered repo rate. But once again – my aim here is mainly to contribute to the discussion. How an interval would be designed, and whether we should have one, is something that we will of course need to look further into. However, this is also a change I believe we could make without turning the monetary policy framework as it is inside out. The policy of inflation targeting does not need fixing, but can potentially be improved Let me now briefly summarise what I have said here today. One of my most important messages is: “if it’s not broken, don’t try to fix it!”. In our eagerness to bring about change, we can often do more damage than good. The aspect I believe is not broken and therefore does not need fixing is the policy of flexible inflation targeting, which in recent decades has developed into something of an international standard. This is not to say that I think it is without problems and cannot be improved. I have highlighted a couple of areas for which I believe there are grounds for consideration as far as Sweden is concerned. One is the target variable, in which case I believe we should consider changing to an index upon which policy rate changes do not have such a major direct impact as on the CPI. Another is an interval surrounding the target. The main reason for considering a reintroduction of an interval is the need to constantly remind people that monetary policy is pursued under significant uncertainty and that the Riksbank is not able to fine-tune the economy and inflation. I look forward to continued discussions about these issues.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Norman T L Chan: Hong Kong’s positioning in the post-QE era Speech by Mr Norman T L Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the Hong Kong Economic Summit 2016, Hong Kong, 7 December 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. Distinguished Guests, 1.  When central banks, such as the US Fed, cut short-term policy interest rates to near zero and created money on a massive scale to purchase bonds and other financial assets, we called it quantitative easing (QE). 2.  It has been more than six years since the launch of QE in 2009. After spending a total of US$3.9 trillion to purchase bonds, the Fed wrapped up its asset purchase programme in October 2014. In 10 days’ time, the Fed will decide whether to lift interest rates. If it does, it will signal the beginning of the normalisation of US interest rates. “QE” Ineffectual? 3.  At the end of 2009, I initiated a guessing game with several chief economists from major commercial and investment banks. The question I asked was when they expected the Fed to exit from QE. Most bet on the second quarter of 2010 or earlier. The most dovish of them said Q3 2010. As we all know now, these guesses were wildly off the mark. To be fair, I don’t think anyone expected the US recovery to be so slow and sluggish. 4.  Indeed, after the Global Financial Crisis, the US suffered its worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In a desperate bid to stave off the recession, the US literally moved mountains, including introducing the unprecedented QE policy and splashing out US$1.8 trillion between 2008 and 2010 to cut taxes and implement other fiscal policy measures to prop up the economy. However, as we can see from Chart 1, the current recovery has been the weakest of all the economic cycles in the past 55 years. The average growth rate is just 2.2%, half the average rate of 4.6% in the previous recovery cycles. (Chart 1) 5.  As for employment, the US has lost a total of 8.7 million jobs during the financial crisis and recession, with the unemployment rate peaking at 10%. Although employment bottomed out in 2010, and some 13 million jobs have been created since then, this only represents 4.3 million more jobs compared with the peak eight years ago in early 2008, and way behind the 8.8 million people who have been added to the labour force over the same period. In other words, while the US unemployment rate has declined to 5% recently, it does not mean the labour market has fully recovered. One of the main reasons for the faster-than-expected drop in the unemployment rate is the dwindling labour force participation rate, from an average of 66% in 2007 to the current 62.4%, the lowest since 1977. This partly explains the feeble economic recovery and declining potential GDP growth trend in the US (Chart 2). 6.  The weak recovery in the US in recent years fell outside the expectations of many economists at the Fed. Because of the lacklustre growth, QE was extended and expanded, feeding an addiction from “low for long”, to “low for longer” and then to “low forever”, and developing a dependence on QE by the market. When the then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted at the possibility of scaling down the asset purchase programme in May 2013, the market panicked in an episode we later called the “Taper Tantrum”. 7.  So, why is the present recovery weaker than in previous cycles? This is a complicated and controversial subject. I believe that both cyclical factors and structural factors, such as household de-leveraging, the high home inventory levels after the bursting of the housing bubble and structural changes in the population and labour market, are at play. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  External factors are also involved, including the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011. However, due to time constraints, I will focus on how QE may have supported US economic recovery and affected the global financial environment. 8.  The prevailing mainstream view, including the major advanced economies such as the US, Europe and Japan, as well as the International Monetary Fund, is that QE is the right policy response to prop up the economy and stave off deflation. They think that pushing down the interest rates to near zero and pumping large amounts of money into the banking system will give rise to the following positive chain effects – (a)  the interest expenses of borrowers, including individuals, corporations and governments, will be reduced; (b)  with lower interest rates and central banks scooping up low-risk sovereign bonds, investors can only resort to equities, properties and other assets in search of higher yields; (c)  asset prices will rise as a result, creating a positive wealth effect which will spur consumption and investment; and (d)  consumption and investment will, in turn, stimulate employment. 9.  Since the consensus was that in a zero interest rate environment QE was the right prescription, when the recovery proved weaker than expected, the natural diagnosis was that the treatment was too short and the dosage was insufficient, which led to expansion of QE and for a longer period. Indeed, in the case of the European Central Bank, the treatment went as far as introducing negative interest rates. Is QE a panacea with no side effects? 10.  While there are benefits, there is a flip side to QE. I share the view of some economists that the effectiveness of QE is partly offset by the adverse side effects of zero interest rates and its prolongation. Here are six side effects that may possibly arise. 11.  First, and foremost, zero interest rates and QE have inflicted big losses on the savers and individuals, funds and institutions reliant on interest incomes. Deposit rates in the US have dropped by 3 percentage points from an average of about 3.5% in 2007. As interest incomes approach the zero mark, many depositors, especially low- and medium-income households and retirees have had to cut their spending. And, while it can be said that “a saver’s loss is a borrower’s gain”, this has not been the case for every borrower. For example, because of negative equity or bad credit scores, many US families are stuck with hefty mortgage rates. In Hong Kong, deposit rates have also dropped by about 2 percentage points since 2007. With total deposits of about HK$10 trillion currently in our banking system, you may wish to think about the potential loss to savers.  12.  Secondly, most US families are still in the process of de-leveraging after the global financial crisis and as a result, growth in consumer demand remains lukewarm. On the corporate front, notwithstanding low borrowing costs, many US companies have been reluctant to invest domestically in expanding capacity and enhancing productivity. In fact, annual growth in business investments in the US has averaged only 3.7% since 2009, well below the average of 5.8% in the past economic expansion cycles. At the same time, many US corporations have spent their cash pile to buy back their own shares. In 2014 alone, US$550 billion was spent in share buyback, bringing the cumulative amount to US$2,500 billion since 2009. As we all know, share buyback may buoy share prices and boost earnings per-share in the short run, but will not improve a company’s productivity and competitiveness, nor create any new jobs. 13.  Thirdly, with the US financial system awash with liquidity from QE and with feeble domestic demand, excess liquidity soon found its way to emerging market economies (EMEs), such as China, Brazil and Russia, in pursuit of higher returns. Between the outbreak 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  of the global financial crisis and the peak in 2014, total inflows to EMEs were estimated to be some US$2.7 trillion, with roughly US$1.6 trillion of it destined for Asia. In the face of the massive inflows, EMEs experienced currency appreciation, an increase in money supply, an expansion of the credit bubble, overheating in the economy and asset markets, etc.  14.  Fourthly, the tide will eventually turn. Currently, with a strong US dollar and the imminent normalisation of US interest rates, EMEs are confronted with capital outflows, currency depreciation, and sharp falls in energy and commodity prices. Their economies and asset markets are coming under varying degrees of downward pressure, which will adversely affect the US and other advanced economies. EMEs have grown much larger in the past decade or two. In particular, China’s GDP ballooned from US$1 trillion in 2000 to US$10 trillion in 2014. More importantly, while EMEs accounted for about 55% of global GDP since 2009, their contribution to global economic growth was as high as 80%. So, a slowdown in EMEs will be an impediment to recovery in the US and other advanced economies. 15. Fifthly, zero interest rates and QE have indirectly widened the income gap. Because of ultra-low interest rates and excess liquidity seeking better returns, stock and property markets rallied in many parts of the world. This is especially true in places with more promising growth prospects like Mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. However, low-income groups, with little if any stocks and properties, have missed out altogether. And their savings in deposit accounts have earned next to nothing. This has exacerbated inequality, resulting in negative implications for social stability and harmony. 16.  Sixthly, zero interest rates and QE have changed the global investment environment. Yields on the traditionally more conservative bonds and fixed income investments have declined. For example, 10-year US Treasuries’ yield has fallen from 5% to about 2%, and some sovereign bond yields in the Eurozone have even plunged into the negative. At the same time, both the exchange rates and bond prices in EMEs have experienced sharp swings recently. With the soon-to-start normalisation of US interest rates, and distorting low-returns and high-volatility in the bond markets, the investment environment will become even more complex and difficult. 17.  While the mainstream thinking recognises that zero interest rates and QE are not without side effects, they still believe that the benefits outweigh the costs. Only history will tell. How should Hong Kong adjust to the US exit from QE? 18.  Let me offer my two cents on the future outlook. The US interest rate will quite possibly start to normalise next week. The US economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace, and the US dollar should remain strong for a period of time. However, it is hard to predict how interest rates, bond yields, fund flows and asset markets will react as we are again entering uncharted waters, much the same as when QE was first launched. Moreover, economies interact with each other and respond to external factors differently, thus making it more difficult to predict market responses. Nevertheless, one thing is certain: a period of difficult adjustment lies ahead for EMEs. Energy and commodity prices will continue to be suppressed. EMEs will continue to witness capital outflows, currency depreciation, economic slowdown and downward pressure on their asset markets. And, Hong Kong will not be immune. We should be prepared to face a period of capital outflows, rising interest rates and slower growth. Asset markets, including the property market, will also face downward pressure. However, if there is an orderly adjustment to asset and property prices, this could provide a respite for prospective homebuyers and business owners squeezed by hefty rents. Now, I would like to take the opportunity to respond to some concerns that under our Linked Exchange Rate system, the Hong Kong dollar will appreciate alongside the US dollar, thereby weakening the competitiveness of our economy, in particular the tourism industry, and dealing a blow to the wobbly retail and tourism sectors. I wish to point out that there is no evidence to suggest a direct linkage between the recent decline in visitor numbers and 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  expenditure, and the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) of the Hong Kong dollar rose by 6.6% year-on-year in the third quarter this year, but price levels for tourism-related merchandise and services fell by a greater magnitude. For example, prices for jewellery, clocks and watches fell by 8.2%, while the average room rate for hotels fell by 15.3%, which more than offset the effects of a stronger Hong Kong dollar. This clearly shows that Hong Kong’s economy is sufficiently flexible to adjust speedily to changing markets. 19.  In addition, Hong Kong is different to other EMEs. We have sound and robust monetary, banking and financial systems. In response to the large capital inflows over the past few years, we have got ourselves well-prepared by introducing seven rounds of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages to enhance the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system. We should be able to withstand the shocks from a reversal of the capital flows and economic adjustments as long as we remain level-headed. We are endowed with a strategic position with the “Hinterland of Mainland China and Interface with the World” under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle. It is true the Chinese economy is experiencing a slowdown, but this reflects a structural shift from unbalanced growth at a breakneck speed to a high-to-moderate growth rate on a more sustainable basis. Indeed, sustainable and healthy development will become the “new normal” in China if it can reap the “reform dividends” by remaining committed to reform and liberalisation, and moving towards a modern and market-based economy. 20.  Against such a backdrop, there is vast potential for Hong Kong’s intermediary role for trade and commerce as well as fund flows between China and the world. To fortify our role, we must, with support from the central government, foster more links with the Mainland. In the financial sector, we should strengthen our soft power by attracting, nurturing and retaining professionals. We should also encourage financial innovation while keeping a firm grip on risk management. In short, we must trump other financial centres in every way to continue our position as the most vibrant and competitive international financial centre in Asia. Thank you.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Rodrigo Vergara: Monetary policy through asset markets – lessons from unconventional measures and implications for an integrated world Opening remarks by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the Central Bank of Chile’s Nineteenth Annual Conference, Santiago, 19 November 2015. *      *      * Monetary policy has mostly been about setting the appropriate interest rates to stir the economy towards a path coherent with its fundamentals. In this sense, the developments in most central banks in the last 6 years have not been out of the box, so to speak. But we can probably say, with little risk of overstating reality, that the ways of achieving changes in the cost of credit through monetary policy has changed significantly since the global financial crisis.  To fully appreciate the extent of these changes, it’s useful to do a quick recap of what traditional monetary policy was prior to 2008. In the vast majority of countries, the name of the game was setting the stance of the short term rates –indeed, the overnight rate at which banks lend to each other. The hope was that, by influencing this very short-term rate, monetary policy actions would feed into the broader economy by affecting longer term rates, as well as spreads of riskier forms of credit which in the end are the channels by which the policy stance affects the cost of borrowing of households and firms. In this context, perhaps the biggest advances of monetary policy of the last 20 years leading to the GFC had to do with the transparency and the overall macroeconomic coherency of interest rate decisions, which led, among other transformations, to the adoption of explicit inflationary objectives in a number of advanced and emerging market economies.  In the aftermath of the global crisis, it soon became clear that traditional MP was simply not going to cut it, especially given the limitations of other policy options, such as fiscal expansion, to reactivate the global economy after the major blow it suffered. Central bankers were forced to be creative and think outside the box of traditional monetary tools in order to make a difference.  A useful framework to understand how policy tools have evolved is to think about interest rates in the following way. The price of a given form of debt, issued at a particular maturity and by a specific counterparty, is the sum of three main components. The first is the expectations of short-term, risk-free debt over the maturity of the instrument. Let’s call this component the path of risk-neutral rates. The second is the compensation for risk that must be offered to an investor to account for the fact that longer maturity instruments are more volatile (have higher duration) than short-term rates, let’s call it the term premium channel. The third is simply default risk. In essence, all policy actions by the Fed, the ECB, the banks of Japan, England, Canada, and of many small open economies in the last 6 years have been about affecting long-term rates by influencing one, and often times more, of these interest rate components.  Take the case of forward guidance. When nominal rates reached the ZLB, and particularly due to the low inflation environments, traditional monetary policy became very constrained –fully constrained by definition, one might say, given the impossibility of lowering short term rates any further. However, to the extent that one can credibly influence the expected path of future monetary policy actions, risk-neutral rates at different horizons can be lowered, perhaps even significantly so. However, as pointed out by Mike Woodford in an influential paper presented at Jackson Hole a few years ago, to truly make a dent on rates with this strategy, central bankers were likely to run into a temporal-inconsistency problem. This problem is basically that in the event that long-term rates can be reduced enough to jump-start the economy, the ex-post optimal policy stance would be inconsistent with the one promised in the midst of stagnation. Quoting from his paper: “the future policy that one wishes for people to anticipate is one that the central bank will not have a motive to implement later, if it makes its decisions then in a purely forward-looking way, on the basis of its usual stabilization objectives.” (end 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  quote) This does seem like a hard conundrum to get away from, and probably limits the traction of this type of tool as a strong driver of longer-term rates.  Partly due to these limitations, Central banks have also directly tackled the term premium by purchasing large quantities of long-term assets. The idea is that by removing some duration from the fixed income markets, private investors’ aggregate exposure to interest rate risk is diminished, leading to a lower required compensation for bearing such risk. Of course, this logic relies on some form of imperfections and/or market segmentation, but there is by now significant evidence, including some excellent papers to be presented in this conference, that QE has had a measurable impact on long-term rates through this channel. A similar logic applies to the default risk-premium: to the extent that returns on safer debt are compressed by central bank purchases, investors are tempted to reach for yield into other fixed-income markets, such as mortgages, corporate bonds, and emerging market instruments.  Against this backdrop, it seems appropriate to dedicate this year’s conference to taking stock of the transformations that have occurred in monetary policy, if not in the objectives, at least in the tools by which these objectives are achieved. Moreover, such introspection seems crucial to our understanding of how to go forward. Indeed, it is very likely that such measures will become standard practices, with the subtitle “unconventional” eventually scratched off altogether.  In fact, there are several reasons to suspect these exceptional measures are here to stay. On the one hand, it might very well be the case that we are witnessing profound structural changes that imply a new normal of much lower interest rates that we have been accustomed to –I suspect the keynote address by Larry Summers tomorrow may touch upon such issues. If this is so, then it is more likely that we will run into the ZLB in future business cycles, forcing central banks to tap upon these so-called unconventional measures time and again. On the other hand, these measures have apparently worked. Why then should we not embrace them as part of our standard set of instruments?  The structure of this conference follows the logic of addressing three main aspects of the transformation in the practice of Monetary Policy in the last decade. Our first session includes three papers that tackle, from both a theoretical and empirical perspective, the impact of such unconventional measures on interest rates at different horizons and over a wide variety of securities. Here we are fortunate to have among the presenters Dimitri Vayanos, Gautti Eggerston, and Eric Swanson, all accomplished scholars who have dedicated an important part of their research in recent years to delve deeper into the quantitative effects of such policies.  The second session deals with the financial stability considerations of these measures. After all, to date several unconventional policy efforts have begun in Japan, the US, Europe and elsewhere, but none has so far ended –in short, we are not out of the woods yet, and claiming success might still be a bit preliminary. The concern is that while an ambitious program of asset purchases might be welcome by different investor classes as asset prices are pushed upwards, it might prove much more difficult to orchestrate an orderly retreat which inevitably relies on increasing discount rates at which future income streams are priced. This is particular true if some projects were only funded to begin with due to the exceptionally low interest rate environment, and/or if such investments were intermediated by fund managers who care not only about income streams, but also (and mostly) about short-term price fluctuations. Here we will have an interesting discussion including papers by Stephen Morris, Michael Woodford, and Gustavo Suarez, which will enlighten us about the theoretical aspects to keep in mind when evaluating the broader consequences of asset purchase programs, as well as the empirical evidence regarding the effects of the risk-taking channel on the quality of loans originated.  But this is not only a conference about monetary policy in developed economies. Indeed, securities from emerging markets fit naturally into the category of riskier assets that are expected to be affected by investors’ search for yield in an environment of low interest rates, as has been documented by a growing and exciting empirical literature. This will be the topic 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  of the third and final session of the conference, and will include presentations by Helene Rey, Simon Gilchrist, and Elias Albagli. This topic is of particular concern for central bankers and policymakers in LATAM and other emerging regions, which have good reasons to be worried with the consequences of US monetary normalization in an environment where further exchange rate pass-through will put increasing pressure on our inflation targets, while at the same time interest rate pass-through puts increased pressure on subpar levels of growth.  Before giving an official start to our nineteenth annual conference, let me end by stressing a related but perhaps less appreciated aspect by which the events of the last few years have changed, I believe in both a fundamental and desirable manner, the way monetary policy is handled and communicated. And if you permit me, I will illustrate the point using the recent Chilean experience.  In Chile, although economic conditions have been far less complex than in developed countries, we have also experimented with unconventional policies ... and frankly, I think the experience has been successful.  First, in response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 the Bank increased the supply of liquidity in pesos and dollars – through repos and swaps –, augmented the extensions of the swap program, and broadened the range of eligible collaterals. They were all measures designed to align market rates with the Monetary Policy Rate and to mitigate foreign currency liquidity tensions. Forward guidance was also an important tool. With the Monetary Policy Rate close to zero – we cut the interest rate from 8.25% to 0.5% in less than a year – , communicating that we planned to keep a very low short-term interest rate for an extended period of time. This was essential in keeping medium and long term interest rates low. These measures – as well as some other more exogenous developments such as the rapid recovery of commodity prices – allowed the economy to rebound quite fast from a mild recession in 2009. Actually, in the post-crisis years GDP growth was above 5% in a context of low inflation.  Over time, these measures were eliminated, but certainly the lessons we learned from the crisis have been incorporated into our policy analysis and toolkit. Among the most significant I would mention two: First, the fact that the central bank must be rapid to respond and use all the available tools if necessary. Second, that a clearer signal about what we believe will be the path of interest rates in the future helps to have a more efficient transmission of the Monetary Policy, particularly in turbulent times. In fact, in the more recent period, marked by a higher than normal level of uncertainty associated with both a grimmer outlook for the Chinese economy and the normalization of monetary policy in the United States, we have made a special effort to signal the financial market what is the likely direction of our monetary policy in our baseline scenario as well as the risks involved. We have done this by increasing the transparency of our analysis and, especially, by being more precise in our communication. Of course it is too soon to make a comprehensive and definite analysis about the costs and benefits of this policy, but in my view this extra amount of forward guidance has been positive in order to achieve a smoother economic adjustment in difficult times.  I thank you for being here, and without further delay, welcome to our nineteenth annual conference: “Monetary policy through asset markets: lessons from unconventional measures and implications for an integrated world.” 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Arjuna Mahendran: The latest financial crisis and Sri Lanka Speech by Mr Arjuna Mahendran, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the International Research Conference, Colombo, 7 December 2015. *      *      * Professor Yi Fu Lin, Dr. Harsha De Silva, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to this 8th research conference by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. I must congratulate Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe and his colleagues who have developed this tradition which in no small way has established the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on the international research map as a meeting place for the profound minds of several leading academic and banking institutions. This conference itself is no small feat to have organized given that we have participants from several parts of the world in Europe and Asia including several areas that we have very strong relationship with as a country, and I think this is a great testimony to the continuing tradition that we have evolved in the Central Bank in terms of creating another center of excellence in Sri Lanka. In my opening remarks I thought I would perhaps take a leaf from Professor Lin’s commentary just now, and perhaps adapt Sri Lanka’s situation in terms of the structuralism or the lack of it that Professor Lin discussed. Now when you look at the total economy, we have in the last five years gone through a fairly challenging period. As Professor Lin said we had the great recession of 2008 and its immediate aftermath what you found was that three strands of relatively new economic activism manifested themselves. In the first instance you saw a huge pump-priming effort by the People’s Republic of China, which in its wake created perhaps the strongest commodity price boom that we have seen in recent history. That I think was a key take away from that period and China to some extent prevented the world from falling into a depression by stimulating its economy, and as Professor Lin has now elaborated to us, it falls in line with his perception that in times of recession developing countries are well-advised to go ahead and really stimulate domestic infrastructure construction etc. to take on the slack caused by international events. Secondly we saw the major central banks of the world, that includes the United States, the Europe, the United Kingdom, Japan and Switzerland, creating money on an unparallel basis which for my calculations to date add up to about 8 trillion dollars worth of new money created in the last 5 to 6 years. That is significant. That’s the second strand that emanated from this crisis period. And thirdly what we have seen is that the so called developing economies in a curious twist of their economy fate, actually became the biggest creditors in the world and the so called rich countries, the developed countries, were actually the biggest debtors. So you’ve turned the world upside down topsy-turvy and today we are seeing India along with other big emerging markets who are effectively lending money to the United States of America by buying their Treasuries and funding their development. So these three stands I think have to be taken into account because they are really new elements of the international financial architecture which have a bearing on how the global economy is going to perform. So what do we see today in the global economy that is different apart from what I just mentioned. First of all you have a liquidity trap. Keynes’s classic liquidity trap is alive and kicking around us. Whatever you do with interest rates it doesn’t care at all for production or for consumption because we have too much liquidity, the 8 trillion that I talked about. In that context how do governments stimulate their economies given that monetary policy has done the heavy lifting, it created this excess liquidity but now going forward there is a need for a new element, the Xfactor, which has to then propel the growth forward. You have very influential commentators like Larry Summers of United States who is calling for another round of quantitative easing in the US because he feels that the long term growth path of the United States economy is still not well embedded and the reason for that is partly due to the demographics. You have ageing populations in Japan, Europe and United States, which 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  means that this baby boom generation, the people who were born just after the second world war were now starting to retire are consuming less and saving more and as a consequence you probably don’t have that space for a consumption led economic impetus that developing countries such as ourselves dependent on for the last 30 or 40 years to grow our economies through an export-led strategy. So my first question is; is that export-led strategy relevant any more given these demographic changes that we see in the advanced economies? And secondly given the fact that the advanced economies are in debt – what happened in the great recession was they nationalized private bad debts in their housing sectors, nationalized it, bought it into the government’s balance sheet and as a consequence that the western economies are effectively net borrowers in the system – do they then have all the gear to stimulate consumption and create another repeat cycle of that export-led boom that really lifted countries like China and other big Asian exporting economies out of the low income status that they had enjoyed for several decades. That to me is a very relevant question that we have to ask ourselves at this conference. Have we got to then look at a different model and that’s where I think one key element of the international economics situation is very important to understand and that has to do with the emergence of information and communication technology as a principal driver of growth, specifically in the services sector of our economies and what have we used in that space to stimulate the growth impetus that previously resided in manufacturing. Now we have to also understand that the manufacturing space has largely converged in China. The Chinese have built an international value chain over the last 30 to 40 years which is unparalleled in terms of its complexity and its far reaching nature and unless small countries like Sri Lanka participate in that value chain we in a sense are losing out on a tremendous opportunity. I put it to you that Sri Lanka still has not integrated itself adequately in that international value chain which the Chinese has built up in the last 30 to 40 years effectively, and that is why we have effectively not fulfilled our growth potential in the last 5 years since the cessation of the internal civil conflict in this country. The second point I like to make is that we rely a lot on foreign savings for the growth of our economy. This a peculiarity of Sri Lanka that we resemble countries like Phillipines and Mexico, in a sense that we have large diasporas living overseas who are fairly high income earners relative to our levels of income in this country and I just asked Dr. Weerasinghe, our national savings rate is about 25 percent, and of that perhaps 6 to 7 percent is accounted for by international savings component of our diaspora. That is a significant number; it means that we can afford investment rates of 26 to 28 percent perhaps even 30 percent in the medium term if we marshal these resources effectively and then create our own growth impetus which will engender a sustainable growth path and at the same time integrate ourselves with this global value chain that the Chinese have constructed very effectively over the last few decades. But there are several challenges that face us in the near term. First of all we have to watch what the American monetary policy makers will do in the next few weeks. That could potentially create some turmoil for international markets including ours and in the process we could see some potential for dislocation which is why Sri Lanka has decided to reach out to multilateral agencies like the IMF and the World Bank to assist us in terms of sheltering or protecting the economy against any adverse developments that may occur in the near future as a consequence of any turmoil in international capital markets if and when US policy makers decide to raise interest rates. That is one hurdle we have to look at. The second hurdle I would say is the lack of a structural change the way international, particularly developed countries of the world, are managing their economic affairs. A lot of the changes that we have seen in the last 5 years has had to do with monetary policy and the aggressive easing of the monetary policy. But on the fiscal side, you haven’t seen any structural changes in countries like the United States and most European countries that took the world into the great recession in 2008 as a consequence of their housing 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  bubbles. That structural change in terms of improving productivity, reducing the size of social security programs and retooling their economies to become more productive has still not started and until that happens we don’t have a sustainable basis for global growth to grow apace. So the question is, will this very complex Chinese driven global value chain face difficulties in terms of engendering growth, going forward in the absence of those structural reforms that we seek countries as diverse as Greece and Italy and even Ireland starting to implement as a means to fostering stronger growth going forward. That’s going to be a big challenge for us in the next few years and I think this conference would do well to try and give us a perspective on that examining in detail on how these structural changes in global economies impact small economies like Sri Lanka and perhaps give us a guidepost in terms of how we can integrate our economy further into the global value chain, which to me is essential for ensuring the future economic prosperity and stability of this country is well-bedded. Thank you very much for your time here this morning and I thank all the participants for your contributions and we look forward for a very stimulating couple of days in this hall. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg: Brief overview of the changing landscape of the financial market in Israel Remarks by Dr Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the institutional investors conference, Eilat, 2 December 2015. *      *      * It is my pleasure to be here at the annual conference of the largest institutional investors in Israel. Today I’d like to give a brief overview of the changing landscape of the financial market in Israel, and particularly to highlight how recent legislation is expected to affect it. Particularly I’d like to discuss three central issues that are always present in any discussion of financial intermediation: the size of the system, its competitiveness and its stability and credibility. No one quite knows what the optimal size of the financial sector is for any country. What we do know is that if it is very large it is prone to crisis, and the past decade has seen a number of examples of overgrown financial markets that suddenly and often quite unexpectedly deflated rather violently and disastrously for the local economy. If the sector is too small, it will stunt economic activity and will not play its central role of channeling savings to borrowers (both to investors and to consumers) in a way that sustains economic growth. In addition it will weaken monetary policy, as it is the main avenue for the transmission mechanism to work itself and impact on economic activity. The second issue, and one which is at the forefront of public discourse in Israel, is the structure of the market, or how competitive the financial sector is. What we typically mean by competitiveness is not necessarily how concentrated that sector is, but rather whether the 3 essential characteristics of a competitive market are present: To what extent is the supply appropriate – or in other words, is access to its services too restricted? Is the pricing adequate – or in other words, do consumers get the best price for the service, the highest interest rate for savers and the lowest interest rate for borrowers of all kinds? Is the sector dynamic in that it constantly innovates new and better services for its clients? A market that is characterized by often complex products, not easily understood or compared by the consumers of those products, as well as by asymmetric information between the seller and the buyer, is a market that is unlikely to reach the “competitive market equilibrium” as delivered by the invisible hand. Last but not least, stability is an issue that is intrinsically attached to financial markets, and not to other markets where the fall and rise of companies are part of the normal course of business, because there is something about the nature of financial services that make them particularly fragile: the seductive appeal of leverage. Anyone who has tasted it can be excessively charmed by it, and when things turn sour the impact on the rest of the economy can be large and long lasting – as we have seen again recently in so many countries, including developed countries that had presumably well developed and regulated markets. The size of the financial sector relative to the economy in Israelis close to the OECD average. A few countries such as Switzerland, Ireland and the UK have become financial hubs and are exporting various financial services to other countries. In the case of Switzerland, the services exports are mostly asset management, Ireland’s are mostly back office services, and in the UK it is mostly financial intermediation. The value added of financial intermediation in Israel was 5.1% of GDP in 2013, slightly less than the 5.4% average in OECD countries. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Total assets of the banking sector in Israel a share of GDP stood at 127% in 2014, well below the OECD median (243%) and average (247%). In fact, the total assets of the banking sector as a share of GDP has been contracting for the past decade from its peak of 147% in 2002. At the same time, the assets that you, the institutional investors, manage have grown over the same period from 67% of GDP in 2002 to 117% in 2014. We may not know whether the financial sector is of optimal size, but these figures show that Israel appears to be pretty much where one would expect it to be, neither very large nor very small – a reassuring figure overall. Turning now to the trickier and thornier issue of the sector’s competitiveness, we do not have all the indicators needed to make a perfect assessment of the situation, but we do note that the concentration in the banking sector is substantially higher than that of developed countries. Perhaps even more striking is the area of consumer loans, which is entirely dominated by the banks, and in particularly by the large banks in Israel. This was always the case, but as banks have receded from granting credit to large corporations, they have increased credit to consumers. Indeed during the past decade, retail credit, including mortgages, has grown much faster than any other type of credit. Over the same period, institutional investors have broadened the allocation of their assets, particularly with respect to investments abroad which have grown from 8% to 19% of their assets between 2005 and 2015. However, they have so far not taken much part in the retail credit market, either in mortgages or in consumer credit. The truth is that it is not typical for large asset managers in developed countries to enter the retail lending market. Institutional investors in Israel have entered the corporate debt market during the past decade, despite the fact that this sector shrunk as a share of GDP during that period. So we know that retail lending has been growing, but it is dominated by the banks, while corporate lending has not been growing as a share of GDP and has been the subject of competition between institutional investors and banks. What about small businesses? First, the importance of small businesses in the Israeli economy is similar to that in the other OECD countries, in fact a bit larger, constituting 42% of business sector GDP – a significant part of the economy that could be a source of economic growth. The banks increased the volume of lending to small and medium businesses from 36% of banks’ business sector credit to 44% between 2011 and 2014. An international comparison is difficult because the distribution is very wide. What about pricing? Well, the smaller the business, the higher the interest rate it pays. Does this reflect the risk involved or market power? What is clear is that profitability over the past 4 years has been much higher in the household and small business sector than for other types of credit. Even if we take into account that these years are upcycle years, and profitability is likely to be affected negatively in a downcycle, there are good reasons to believe that the higher pricing is in part due to market power. Recent legislation and regulatory changes will tackle this problem and should bring the institutional investors, to that the small business and household credit market as well. The establishment of a credit registry tackles the problem of asymmetric information, while the legislation enabling securitization will allow institutional investors to enter the retail market indirectly – as it is done in many other places in the world – by connecting institutional capital with the banks’ ability to grant credit, which will lead to an expanded supply of credit and lower financing costs. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  R Gandhi: NBFCs – medium term prospects Speech by Mr R Gandhi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 1st Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) Summit, organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mumbai, 21 December 2015. *      *      * Assistance provided by Shri C D Srinivasan and Shri Anuj Sharma is gratefully acknowledged. 1. I am happy to be addressing this first ever CII Summit on Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) to deliberate on “Regulatory Paradigm & Contours of Growth – Vision 2020”. The context in which such a Summit has been organised is also very apt. World over, there is an awakening, post the great financial crisis of 2008, about the existence, contribution, magnitude, significance and risks of non-banking financial sector. From a benign neglect of or indifference to this sector, either by default or by deliberate choice, the world has now become anxious and seriously concerned about it. This awakening has resulted in enhanced attention, monitoring and regulation of this sector. Therefore, it is very apt that the sector has also noticed it and desires to seriously discuss its prospects in the changed scenario and realign itself with a renewed vision. Global shadow banking monitoring report of FSB – 2015 2. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), came into existence post financial crisis, when the Leaders of the G20 countries decided to convert the then existing Financial Stability Forum into FSB to address vulnerabilities and to develop and implement strong regulatory, supervisory and other policies in the interest of financial stability. The FSB has been monitoring the shadow banking sector closely for the past five years and publishing its monitoring report. I will like to highlight some of the key findings from its latest report, as they will provide a worthwhile background setting for your deliberations today. 3. The 2015 Report of the FSB presents the results of the fifth annual monitoring exercise using data as of end 2014 for 26 jurisdictions, which together account for about 80% of global GDP and 90% of global financial system assets. The report includes the results of the macro-mapping, including size and growth trends of the Monitoring Universe of Non-banking Financial Institutions (MUNFI) estimate, cross-jurisdiction analysis, trends in sub-sectors and interconnectedness with the banking system. It also discusses a narrower measure of shadow banking, which is constructed by filtering out non-bank financial activities that have no direct relation to credit intermediation (e.g. Equity Investment Funds) or that are already prudentially consolidated into banking groups. As a result, it is believed that this narrower measure more accurately reflects the size and composition of the shadow banking sector, subject to the caveats and FSB’s resolve to further refine the narrower measure. Another change that has been brought in this time around is a new activity-based “economic function” measure of shadow banking, each of which involves non-bank credit intermediation that may pose shadow banking risks (e.g. maturity / liquidity transformation and leverage). The five economic functions are certain entities that are susceptible to runs (EF1), lending dependent on short-term funding (EF2), market intermediation dependent on short-term funding or secured funding of client assets (EF3), facilitating credit creation (EF4), and securitisation-based intermediation (EF5). 4. The main findings from the latest exercise are as follows: The Narrow Measure i. The narrow measure of global shadow banking that may pose financial stability risks amounted to $36 trillion in 2014 for the 26 participating jurisdictions. This is equivalent 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  to 12% of financial system assets, and has grown moderately over the past several years. ii. More than 80% of global shadow banking assets reside in a subset of advanced economies in North America, Asia and northern Europe. iii. The new classification by economic functions shows that credit intermediation associated with collective investment vehicles with features that make them susceptible to runs (e.g. money market funds (MMFs), hedge funds and other investment funds) represents 60% of the narrow measure of shadow banking. It has grown more than 10% on average over the past four years. By contrast, the level of securitisation-based credit intermediation – among the key contributors to the financial crisis – has fallen in recent years. iv. At the aggregate level, interconnectedness between the banking and the non-bank financial system continues to decrease from its pre-crisis peak. The broad measure i. An aggregate “MUNFI” measure of the assets of other financial intermediaries (OFIs), pension funds and insurance companies grew by 9% to $137 trillion over the past year, and now represents about 40% of total financial system assets in 20 jurisdictions and the euro area. ii. In aggregate, the insurance company, pension fund and OFI sectors all grew in 2014, while banking system assets fell slightly in US dollar terms. iii. While non-bank financial intermediation shrank somewhat immediately following the financial crisis, it has been rising over the past several years. OFI assets in the 20 jurisdictions and the euro area reached 128% of GDP in 2014, up 6 percentage points from 2013 and 15 percentage points from 2011. It is nearing the previous high-point of 130% prior to the financial crisis. iv. Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) showed the most rapid increases in OFI assets. In 2014, 8 EMEs had OFI growth rates above 10%, including two that grew over 30%. However, this rapid growth is generally from a relatively small base. v. Among OFI sub-sectors that showed the most rapid growth in 2014 are trust companies, MMFs, and fixed income and other funds. Trust companies (mostly based in China) continued to experience growth of 26%, similar to the past several years. Perhaps more surprisingly, MMFs experienced 20% growth in 2014 (largely driven by some euro area jurisdictions and China), following low or negative growth in the prior three year period. Fixed income funds and other funds grew approximately 15% in 2014. vi. It should be noted that hedge funds remain underestimated in the FSB’s exercise due to the fact that a portion of international financial centres (IFCs), where a number of hedge funds are domiciled, are currently not within the scope of the exercise. Shadow banking in India 5. While the world generally refers to this sector as “shadow banking sector”, we have been calling it as the “non-banking financial sector”. Further, while the world has, as I said, now sat up and perked its collar to look at this sector intensely, India had understood the sector’s relevance and the risks that it may pose, way back in early 1960s itself, when, in 1963, Chapter III B dealing with regulation of the Non-Banking Financial Institutions was added to the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934. It recognised that non-banking financial activity is an integral part of the financial system and complements commercial banking; only that appropriate vigilance and due-diligence will be needed to regulate this sector. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  NBFC regulation 6. In a free economy, economic agents are primarily free to undertake any economic activity. In their normal course, they will be aspiring for continuous growth. However, certain economic activities have, as we all know, greater externalities and financial sector is one where the externalities are such that it warrants close regulation and supervision in the interests of systemic stability, safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions and to protect the consumers. The objective of NBFC regulations during the twentieth century was predominantly to protect the interests of the depositors. However, as the NBFCs grew in size and their interconnectedness with the banking system became visible and raised concerns about their capacity to disturb systemic stability, the NBFCs were brought under prudential regulatory framework from 2006 onwards. 7. While the overall approach followed the contours as described above, the Reserve Bank, as the regulator of NBFCs has kept the sector’s potential to contribute to the development of identified segments of the economy and accordingly has been following a developmental bias in its regulatory framework relating to the NBFCs. The NBFCs focus on niche areas of business addressing specific needs of customers. Therefore, the Reserve Bank has classified varieties of specific types of NBFCs separately and regulates each such type differently. As on date such types include asset financing, core investment, loan, investment, micro-financing, factoring, infrastructure financing, mortgage guarantee, etc. activities. Further, the housing finance, insurance and collective investment activities, though statutorily defined as NBFI activities, their regulations have been left in the hands of other sectoral regulators like the National Housing Bank (NHB), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). 8. This approach reflected the position that non-bank financial system may contribute to financial deepening in these identified segments. The NBFCs can be advantageous due to their ability to lower transaction costs, quick decision making capabilities, customer orientation and prompt provision of services. In terms of products and services offered, the NBFCs complement the banks. 9. Nevertheless, the business model of NBFCs is inherently risk-prone. Weaker underwriting standards, enhanced risk taking capabilities and increased complexity of their activities cause concerns. 10. Besides riskiness pertaining to business model, NBFCs are exposed to key risks emanating from regulatory gaps, arbitrage and contagion effect. NBFCs are more prone to systemic risks on account of concentration of exposure to specific sectors. Also, since these entities are more dependent on bank funding, both directly and indirectly, the interconnectedness risk tends to be higher. Their asset-liability mismatches accentuate liquidity risks. All told, these risks can quickly escalate as solvency risks and lead to systemic risk as well. 11. Therefore, careful and continuous monitoring is still required to detect any increases in systemic risk factors (e.g. maturity and liquidity transformation, and leverage) that could arise from the rapid expansion of credit provided by the non-bank sector. Reserve Bank has been dynamically making the regulatory framework suitable for the day. Certain changes in the framework brought in the last year or so deserve some recollection. Recent NBFC regulations 12. Changes to the regulations concerning NBFC sector over the last decade and a half had largely been incremental. However, in November 2014, a detailed review of the entire regulatory framework for the NBFC sector was undertaken with a view to transitioning, over time, to an activity based regulation of NBFCs as opposed to the current approach of entity-based regulation. The Bank has been mindful of the fact that the revisions should not impede 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the dynamism displayed by NBFCs in delivering innovation and last mile connectivity for meeting the credit needs of the productive sectors of the economy. The broad principles followed in framing the revised guidelines was to review the regulations from the perspective of the mandate of the Reserve Bank, viz., financial stability, depositor protection and customer protection. Hence, a) the focus has been on addressing risks where they exist, b) address gaps in regulation, c) reduce complexities and make regulations simple and easy to follow, d) harmonise regulations within the sector and with that of banks to a limited extent, e) acknowledge that there may be pockets within the sector that do not require to be stringently regulated and f) give adequate time to the NBFCs to adjust to the revised regulatory framework so that there are no disruptions in business. 13. Consequently, the revised regulatory framework for NBFCs was introduced and the threshold for systemic significance has been revised to total asset size of ₹ 500 crore. Now, there are two broad categories of NBFCs requiring closer attention of regulators and supervisors. These are a) non – deposit accepting NBFCs with asset size of less than ₹ 500 crore (NBFCs-ND) and b) non – deposit accepting NBFCs with assets of ₹ 500 crore and above (NBFCs-ND-SI) and deposit accepting NBFCs (NBFCs-D). Reporting and regulatory provisions are accordingly applied to have better focus on systemically important entities and efficient allocation of supervisory resources. 14. Minimal prudential regulations have been prescribed for non-deposit accepting NBFCs with asset size of less than ₹ 500 crore. For these non-deposit accepting companies (NBFCs-ND) below the threshold of systemic significance, prudential regulations, other than capital adequacy and credit concentration norms, are applicable only where public funds are accepted and conduct of business regulations (FPC, KYC) where there is customer interface. A simple leverage ratio of 7 has been put in place so that their asset growth is in sync with the capital they hold. Further, reporting by such NBFCs will be through a simplified annual return. However, registration under Section 45 IA of the RBI Act is mandatory and they are subjected to a simplified reporting system along with minimum net owned funds (NOF) of ₹ 2 crore. 15. For those non-deposit accepting companies (NBFCs-ND-SI) above the threshold of systemic significance and for all NBFC-D, prudential regulations are applicable and conduct of business regulations wherever customer interface exists. In line with international best practices, core capital requirement has been strengthened (existing 7.5%; raised to 10% to be phased over 2 years). Asset classification norms have been aligned with that of banks (from the current 180 day and 360 day norm for loan and HP / Leased assets respectively to a 90 day norm phased in over 3 years). Higher standard asset provisioning has been put in place (0.4% against the existing 0.25% phased in over 3 years). Further, credit concentration norms have been harmonised between the various categories of NBFCs by removing the dispensation given to AFCs to exceed the defined norms by 5%. (Dispensation given to IFCs and IDFs has been retained as infra loans are high value loans) and corporate governance standards, viz., fit and proper criteria for directors, disclosure and transparency have been strengthened so that they are professionally managed and develop a sound compliance culture. 16. In order to harmonise the deposit acceptance regulations across all deposit taking NBFCs (NBFCs-D) and move over to a regimen of only credit rated NBFCs-D accessing public deposits, existing unrated Asset Finance Companies (AFCs), which were permitted to accept deposits, shall have to get themselves rated by March 31, 2016. Further, the limit for acceptance of deposits has been reduced for rated AFCs from 4 times earlier to 1.5 times of NOF. 17. The Principal Business Criteria (PBC) for NBFC-Factors has been revised to 50:50 from the existing 75:75, thereby aligning it with the provisions of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011. Consequently, an NBFC whose factoring assets and factoring income are 50 percent of the total assets and total income respectively are now classified as NBFC-Factors. This is expected to provide a boost to factoring activities in the country. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  18. In the case of NBFC- MFIs , based on recommendations of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (Chairman: Dr. Nachiket Mor), the limit on the total indebtedness of a borrower was raised to ₹ 1,00,000/- from ₹ 50,000/-. Income criteria of borrowers for loans to be included as qualifying assets of these NBFCs was changed: for borrowers with a rural household annual income not exceeding ₹ 1,00,000/- against ₹ 60,000/- earlier and urban and semi-urban household income not exceeding ₹ 1,60,000/- against ₹ 1,20,000/- earlier; ceiling on the amount of loan that can be disbursed was revised to ₹ 60,000/- from ₹ 35,000/- earlier in the first cycle and ₹1,00,000/- from ₹ 50,000/- earlier in subsequent cycles. The income generating loan component has been reduced from 70% to 50%. Further, the Bank has also raised the loan limit, requiring a mandatory tenure of 24 months, to ₹ 30,000/- from ₹ 15,000. Growth of the NBFC sector 19. Total number of NBFCs have come down from 51,929 in 1997 to 11,769 as on September 30, 2015 whereas the asset size has grown from ₹ 75913 crore as at end March 1998 to ₹ 16,10,729 crore at end September 2015. Share of NBFC assets as a percentage of scheduled commercial banks’ assets has increased from 7% in 1998 to 14.8% in March 2015. There are 202 NBFCs-ND-SI (assets size ₹ 500 crore and above) with a total asset size of ₹14126 billion. The number of deposit taking NBFCs, including Residuary Non-Banking Finance Companies (RNBCs), decreased from 1,420 in 1997–98 to 209 in September 2015. Share of NBFC deposits as a percentage of scheduled commercial banks’ deposits has come down from 3.34% in March 1997 to 0.30% in March 2015. 20. Sources and Uses of Funds of NBFC Sector – Position As on September 30, 2015  21. Loans and advances extended by NBFCs-ND-SI posted strong double-digit growth of 15.5% during 2014–15, in contrast to the slowdown in commercial bank’s non-food credit during the same period (Chart 4.6). Strong growth in credit extended by the infrastructure finance companies, microfinance companies and loan companies contributed to sturdy growth in the loan portfolio of NBFCs-ND-SI. Among the sectors, infrastructure, medium and large-scale industries, and the transport sectors contributed to strong growth in credit off-take of the NBFCs-ND-SI. During 2014–15, NBFCs-ND-SI raised funds mainly through debentures and commercial papers. Borrowings from banks, which earlier constituted to be the main source of funding, has been progressively reduced. A notable feature is the rising exposure of mutual funds to the financial instruments floated mainly by the NBFC-Infrastructure Finance Companies (IFCs), Loan Companies (LCs) and NBFC-Micro Finance Institution (NBFC-MFIs). 22. In recent years, asset quality of NBFC sector has gone through the vicissitudes of overall deterioration spreading across the financial system as the economy slowed. Gross NPAs as per cent of credit deployed rose to 4.1 per cent by end-March 2015. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches   Prospects 23. In my opinion, the prospects for the sector in the medium term are not going to be uniform. Different segments of the sector are poised for different prospects and challenges. 24. For example, the NBFC-MFI segment is going to shrink heavily as the big ten of them convert themselves into Small Finance Banks in the next one year or so. I will hasten to add that this can yet bring higher impetus for the other NBFC-MFIs to grow, not just because of the availability of space vacated by the big ten, but also because the capital that will be released when many of the converting NBFC-MFIs pay off the current investors as a part of capital restructuring, and because of renewed interests by such venture capital aiming growth prospects in such conversions in the future. 25. The infrastructure NBFCs will have greater scope in the coming years, both because the economic growth will bring forth new projects and banks, having learnt lessons in the recent past, will have a restrained approach towards such projects. If the Infra-NBFCs will have their structuring these projects in a careful way, they will have good prospects. 26. As the large exposure regime for the banks will apply by 2018, NBFCs will have space for market funding or loan funding of big corporate financing in the medium term. 27. Loan companies will face enhanced consumer protection measures. They will be required to appropriately educate their workforce in selling right. 28. Investment companies will have bright prospects, as the equity and corporate bond markets expand, along with economic growth and careful recalibration of bank finance in the wake of Basle III. Regulation – The way forward 29. At present, there are several categories of NBFCs and regulations vary across these NBFCs. The Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (Chairman: Dr. Nachiket Mor) had recommended merger of various categories of NBFCs, into two viz., NBFCs and Core Investment Companies (CICs) and moving towards activity based regulation. The regulatory framework, put in place in November 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  2014, is a first step in this direction. Going forward, we will work towards greater harmonisation of the regulations with a view to reducing the number of NBFC categories. 30. However, the Reserve Bank is alive to the developmental needs of the economy and therefore will continue to approve of new types of NBFCs if the economy will need them. One such is NBFC-Account Aggregator (NBFC-AA) about which the Reserve Bank announced on July 02, 2015. The NBFC-AA will provide a technology enabled solution to a person to view at one place the position of his financial assets across institutions under different sectoral regulators. The guidelines for the same are under preparations. 31. Also, the Reserve Bank is actively studying the Peer-To-Peer lending arrangements that are slowly gaining traction. While recognising the need for innovative products and services, we should be conscious about the risks that may emanate out of such innovations. Based on the detailed study, we intend to bring out a Discussion Paper for public consultation. 32. There are demands that the regulations relating to the Core Investment Companies need revisiting. This is a work-in-process. Conclusion 33. To conclude, I can only quote what the FSB concluded in its 2015 Report. “Intermediating credit through non-bank channels can have important advantages and contributes to the financing of the real economy, but such channels can also become a source of systemic risk, especially when they are structured to perform bank-like functions (e.g. maturity and liquidity transformation, and leverage) and when their interconnectedness with the regular banking system is strong. Appropriate monitoring of shadow banking and the application of appropriate policy responses, where necessary, helps to mitigate the build-up of such systemic risks”. The Reserve Bank remains committed to such an approach. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  R Gandhi: Payment revolution – preparing for participation Speech by Mr R Gandhi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the “National Payments Excellence Awards 2015”, organized by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCi), Mumbai, 22 December 2015. *      *      * Assistance provided by Shri Vipin Surelia is gratefully acknowledged. Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. 1. It was in the Reserve Bank’s Payment Systems Vision 2005–08 document, which I was fortunate enough to draft, it was indicated that the focus would be on setting up of a new institution for all retail payment systems and operationalizing a national settlement system. This new institution would be a limited company, owned and operated by banks and act as an umbrella organization for all retail clearing operations, both paper based and electronic. I am very glad that the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) established in 2009 footed the bill in perfect unison and has now emerged as the prime engine chugging ahead in the retail payment systems. NPCI is working closely with the banking community and payments technology industry at large and is at the forefront of digitizing the payments while also providing for interoperability. The industry has also been privy to the new initiatives taken by NPCI which are impacting the payments system positively. As it is, NPCI is completing six years now and in its six years existence, it has successfully launched six products viz., grid-wise operations of the CTS, Interoperability on NACH, IMPS, NFS and the RuPay card scheme. I am sure that NPCI has and will have much more successful rabbits under its hat. I understand NPCI is in an advanced stage of offering Touch & Go cards and is discussing the modalities for introducing interoperability for ETC Tags. My hearty congratulations to the Team NPCI headed by Shri A P Hota, a long-time friend. 2. We have been focusing our attention on developing the payment systems in the country for the past thirty five years, starting from the computerization of clearing houses way back in early 1980s. Thanks to all these years’ efforts, today we have a vibrant, innovating, efficient and secured payment eco system in the country. The share of electronic payments is continuously on the increase, both in volume and value terms. Several payment channels viz., cards (including credit, debit and prepaid varieties), near field and cardless, electronic, internet and mobile based, are growing in big proportions. ATMs and POS machines have proliferated. 3. However, the country is very big, spread over 3.288 million sq km area, with 1.2 billion citizens, and 650,000 plus villages. The growth recorded so far, though gratifying, is nowhere near our fellow emerging markets, leave alone developed west or east. Therefore, we need to be pressing ahead with our efforts in this area. The Reserve Bank is working on the next Payment Systems Vision document. In this context, it is also imperative that market participants also continue to take serious interest in developing the payment systems. That will need quite a catalytic efforts from common interest groups. One of such efforts is to recognize performance and it is heartening to note that NPCI has constituted the “National Payments Excellence Awards” to identify and reward the member banks for their performance on the network. The awards are in several categories, separate for big players and not so big players. My hearty congratulations to the awardee banks and their staff. I am sure that other banks will redouble their efforts to win over these awards in the coming years. Emerging payment revolution 4. According to a research report of Goldman Sachs, one of the three emerging trends in the financial world is the payment revolution. It says that the drivers that are changing the way we pay are the technology, the regulations, the demography and international factors. Innovations in network technology, cryptography and telecom technology, the regulations 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  relating to Consumer protection, Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Funding, directions on transaction fees and interchange fees, the Financial inclusion initiatives, the B2C, C2C, B2B type of payments, the Cryptocurrencies and the tech-savvy-Gen-Next are all bringing forth that revolution. 5. The Payments Landscape in India is also changing and is changing fast; the key elements are the regulatory focus on creating robust payments infrastructure, technology enabling solutions to be available in millions of hand held devices, the number literate populace, the evolving payments marketplace with new players and existing players riding the enhanced culture of innovation in the country to create solutions that are Make In India and Made for India. 6. To reach out to all segments of the society, Interoperability is the key and a critical ingredient to evolving larger payment ecosystems. NPCI today provides the largest interoperable domestic network for multiple services and caters interoperability as the core service to the community. The retail payments in the next 3–5 years are likely to be driven essentially through Mobile payments. This is to ride on over 1 billion mobile connections in the country and the Financial Inclusion drive. 7. In order to participate in the ensuing Payment Revolution and to take advantage thereof, we need to be taking certain strategic actions. These are as follows: a) Expanding the acceptance ecosystem: The proliferation of digital channels is evident mostly in the Tier I & Tier II centres of the country. In order to promote digital channels, it is incumbent on the ecosystem which includes the banks, Network partners and others. To ensure that there is adequate availability of digital channels and enablers such as Debit Cards, Internet Banking registrations, etc. in Tier III to Tier VI centres as well. It is of critical importance that the population in over 6 lakh villages in the country is exposed to the alternate delivery channels. Some estimates indicate that to reach the average levels of BRIC countries, India will need 20 million POS terminals as against the current 1.2 million. This is a tall order. b) Government initiatives: There have been attempts to move the government direct benefit transfers onto electronic channels. I believe that with over 946 million Aadhaar numbers having been issued, Electronic benefit transfer is a clear strategy to promote efficient payment systems. c) Interoperability: Interoperability of the digital channels as I mentioned earlier is a key driver to promote digital channels. The digital channels by definition should be available anywhere & anytime. d) Simplicity and Standardization: End customers need to have simple ways of accessing the digital channels. This can be brought about through seamless processes driven by the ecosystem partners. And for this, standardization of the processes, right from registration to delivery and post delivery services is an imperative. e) Security: No Electronic payment mechanism can undermine the role of security and risk mitigation in promoting digital channels. There has to be continuous and concerted efforts to ensure that the digital channels are safe & secure. The confidence of customers shall be a key to deepening the usage of digital channels. 8. With these steps, and in association with the key stakeholders like the Reserve Bank, the Government, the banks, the payment system participants and the catalysts like NPCI, the Reserve Bank is quite sanguine that India will reap the advantages of the Payment Revolution. 9. I wish NPCI and payments community all the very best to shape the banking of future and future of banking.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mark Carney: Opening statement at the European Parliament’s ECON Committee Opening statement by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the European Parliament’s ECON Committee, Brussels, 7 December 2015. *      *      * Mr Chair, Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, It is a pleasure to address you in my capacity as Vice-Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board. Maintaining financial stability requires strong policy frameworks, a dynamic understanding of risks, and, when appropriate, co-ordination of individual macro-prudential policies. The need for a coordinating authority within the EU is particularly important, given the unique nature of the single market and its high degree of integration. In fulfilling this role, the ESRB is making financial stability policy more effective across the EU. 1. On openness in the EU The openness of European member states supports economic dynamism by facilitating trade and specialisation, by enhancing competition, and by encouraging more diversification and risk-sharing. Larger markets mean wider choice, bigger incentives for innovation, and greater scope to realise economies of scale. While openness boosts dynamism, it also increases exposure to shocks from abroad. Financial linkages in particular can create new vulnerabilities and the potential to deepen shocks. The ESRB can help build the resilience to maximise the benefits from openness and minimise the risks it entails. In this spirit, I would like to outline three specific contributions of the ESRB during my time as Vice Chair. 2. Building stronger macroprudential frameworks The ESRB has promoted stronger macroprudential frameworks across the Union. Specifically the ESRB has issued recommendations to encourage national legislators to establish macroprudential authorities within their jurisdictions. Its Handbook on Operationalising Macroprudential Policy in the Banking Sector embodies practical information on how to set policy using the newly-established powers. The Handbook sets out best practice on an instrument by instrument basis, suggests indicators to guide their use, and outlines the legal framework governing them. It also details potential spillovers. Where it judges that best practice is not being followed, the ESRB can use “soft law” to issue recommendations on an “act or explain” basis to mitigate financial stability risks and curb spillovers. For example, last year the ESRB gave guidance to national macroprudential authorities on how to set countercyclical capital buffer rates. The ESRB will follow up that guidance with a published assessment of implementation in 2016 Q3. With macroprudential policy still in its adolescence, the ESRB is helping it to mature. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Recent ESRB studies have evaluated the case for using margining to counteract pro-cyclical behaviour in derivatives and securities financing transactions. And this year, the ESRB assessed the value of including macroprudential buffers within the leverage ratio framework. The Bank of England has followed this approach to ensure that the leverage ratio complements the risk-weighted capital framework in a way that makes it robust to cyclical and structural risks. One of the strengths of the ESRB is its ability to harness data and conduct analysis across all EU Member States. In its work on the leverage ratio, the ESRB collected new empirical evidence showing banking sector leverage has been pro-cyclical at an aggregate level in almost all Member States. Average risk weights tend to fall in credit booms and rise in downturns.  Working with EBA data, the ESRB found that systemically important banks in Europe typically have lower risk weights and leverage ratios than other types of banks. Taken together, theory and evidence demonstrate the importance of a dynamic leverage ratio to a robust macroprudential framework. Another way that the ESRB has led in identifying best practice and influencing the international agenda has been to take a macroprudential perspective on how elements of the financial system can support long-term prosperity. For example, in its examination of Solvency II, the ESRB has considered how long-term investors like insurers can bring diversity and stability to the system. In my view, more can be done to ensure that Solvency II creates the right framework for long-term investment. The ESRB can provide a constructive and objective macroprudential perspective as an input to Parliament’s review in 2018 of aspects of the operation of Solvency II. Openness puts a premium on shared understanding of risks. The ESRB plays a vital role for the EU, enhancing members’ assessment of new and evolving risks. The structure of the financial system has changed significantly since the crisis. Virtually all of the net credit growth since then has been from the bond markets. In tandem, the assets under management have risen by 60% globally and 80% in the EU. These trends will continue as the Capital Markets Union is developed. The ESRB is currently contributing in two ways to more resilient capital markets. First, it is promoting a shared understanding of the fundamental drivers of market liquidity. Second, it is gathering consistent information on the nature and size of the risks associated with market-based finance. The ESRB has unique powers in this regard given its ability to collect information from financial participants from across the EU.1  The ESRB is currently surveying market makers and asset managers as part of a broader study into the risks from a reduction in market liquidity. This work should be completed by mid-2016. The survey will draw out the implications for liquidity conditions, including whether open-ended funds have liquidity sufficient to meet redemptions in the event of market stress.                                                 1  Of course, the ESRB must exercise this power with care and precision. And the case for doing so must be compelling. But the rapid growth of market-based finance satisfies these tests. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In a similar survey of 143 investment funds, the Bank of England found that, in aggregate, these funds expected to be able to liquidate in one day roughly three times estimated dollar corporate bond market turnover; clearly a fallacy of composition. The ESRB survey will provide a valuable wider perspective. Armed with such insights, the ESRB can help design appropriate policy responses. Stress testing of the investment fund sector can be expected in the future, complementing existing stress tests of banks, insurers and pension funds. The ESRB is also beginning to access detailed derivative trade reports from trade repositories across the Union. By pooling national expertise and leveraging the ESRB’s unique access to the entire set of trades, authorities can better understand the complex webs of derivative transactions and how they could propagate and dampen risk across the system. It can also assess the impact of mandatory central clearing and whether it shifts risks to other parts of the system such as direct clearing banks. 3. Greater openness can require shared approaches to managing risks In some cases, shared understanding is not sufficient; authorities also need shared ways of managing risks. The ESRB is the only hub where all the relevant authorities are present, including central banks, bank supervisors, and securities authorities. Through our regular dialogue we can establish and update best practice. Consider residential real estate. This year ESRB’s work emphasised how these markets were influenced by structural differences, from Loan-to-Value restrictions to tax treatments, across the EU. Its analysis identified the tools authorities may use to respond to different vulnerabilities, ranging from capital measures to restrictions on debt-to-income ratios and collateral. Key lessons of the analysis include that: 1. flexibility is needed in both design and calibration of macroprudential tools; 2. no single tool can combat all property risks; 3. tools need to be appropriate to domestic circumstances; and 4. domestic policies are more effective for both domestic and EU financial stability if their spillovers are managed. The ESRB has built a framework to assess and manage such spillovers, which should be agreed soon and be operationalised early next year. Its central feature is reciprocity – eliminating regulatory arbitrage to give domestic policy greater traction. It will be member led, but, importantly, backed by ESRB recommendations. Compliance will be on an “act or explain” basis but the presumption will be that many exposure-based measures (e.g. LTV, LTI and maturity) will be reciprocated. This is significant. The ESRB has been notified of macroprudential actions 69 times this year, and 173 times since the introduction of the CRR/CRD in 2014. Although many notices are procedural, they show the direction of travel. More countries are using macroprudential tools, creating an increasing need for a “clearing house” that is both comprehensive and timely. The ESRB will also evaluate the ways national macroprudential authorities might apply countercyclical capital buffers against financial exposures from countries outside the EEA – a tool given to the ESRB under Union law. That will further bolster collective resilience against the global financial cycle and spillovers from outside the Union. While risks in property markets reflect national differences, other risks such as misconduct have more common determinants. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In the past five years, misconduct penalties imposed on EU banks have totalled €50bn. Those costs have direct implications for the real economy. At 5% leverage, that capital could have supported €1 trillion of lending capacity. More fundamentally, repeated episodes of misconduct undercut public trust in the system.2  The ESRB’s work has helped catalyse sensible actions to begin the process to rebuild that trust. First, it has proposed capturing misconduct costs in stress tests to ensure banks remain resilient even under severe outcomes. The Bank of England has followed this approach in its most recent stress test which included and additional £40bn of misconduct costs. These costs were calibrated to have a low likelihood of being exceeded and are therefore, by design, much larger than the amounts already provided for by banks. Second, the ESRB has also proposed tackling misconduct at source by increasing individual accountability. This can be done by reforming remuneration – using variable pay, combined with Malus and Clawback, to hard-wire stronger incentives for good behaviour within firms. The UK is committed to this approach with the toughest remuneration regime in the EU, including the longest deferrals and claw backs. However, the effectiveness of such measures across the EU is being tempered by the bonus cap. For example, in 2013, the ratio between fixed and variable for material risk takers at major UK banks was around 1:3 – meaning three quarters of remuneration was at risk from individual misconduct. The next year, when firms first had to apply the bonus cap, that ratio had fallen to around 1:1, with the overall level of remuneration unaffected. Prompted by the ESRB, the FSB is now examining the impact of various compensation tools on misconduct, and if appropriate, it will recommend improvements to next year’s G20 summit. Reforms to compensation are necessary but not sufficient. ESRB reports have rightly stressed that more should be done to hold senior individuals to account. Prompted in part by the ESRB, the FSB members will share experiences on the role of bank regulatory powers to address misconduct and on approaches to enhancing individual accountability. In the UK, we are implementing a new regime to ensure senior managers right across the financial system are held directly accountable for failures in their areas of responsibility. That will be buttressed by clear code of conduct, designed by practitioners, to ensure high standards are understood by all. 4. Conclusion All member states, and more fundamentally all EU citizens, have a stake in EU financial stability. The ESRB helps deliver this foundation of prosperity. The financial crisis starkly illustrated how quickly risks could spill across borders, the need for wide-ranging reforms, and a new approach to addressing risks. With your leadership, the reform programme is substantially complete, and authorities are now implementing it to maximise its effectiveness.                                                 2  Bank of England survey results. Respondents were asked for their views on the statement ‘I believe that financial markets work in the interest of society’. Possible responses were: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. Only one third agreed or strongly agreed. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  But durable financial stability requires more than microprudential standards that bolster the resilience of individual firms. It also requires a macroprudential perspective, with flexibility to respond to shocks wherever they occur; with higher standards for systemically important firms; and to increase levels of resilience when risks increase. The ESRB has been helping Member states fulfil these roles, and it remains alert to emerging vulnerabilities. As President Draghi recently described to this Committee, over the coming year, the ESRB will develop assessments of the macroprudential stances of Member States to complement its existing risk monitoring and focus on the risks of low interest rates on financial stability and an abrupt transition to a low-carbon economy. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your comments and questions.  
   Guy Debelle: Some effects of the new liquidity regime Speech by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the 28th Australasian Finance and Banking Conference, Sydney, 16 December 2015. *      *      * Thanks to George Gardner, Tai Lam, David Wakeling and Kelsey Wilkins. Today I would like to discuss a few aspects of the liquidity regime that has been in operation in Australia for almost a year now, namely the application of one important aspect of the Basel III standards, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). I will describe some of the features of the LCR regime that have emerged over the past year and some of the market developments that have taken place since its introduction. I will also summarise some of the information that the Reserve Bank has gathered from a related development, the provision of detailed information on asset-backed securities. This information has resulted from the Bank’s stipulation that for an asset-backed security to be repo-eligible in the Bank’s operations, or to be usable collateral for the Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF), an issuer needs to provide loan-level data and detailed information on the security. The LCR has been in full operation in Australia from the beginning of this year. In 2013, banks had a trial run, so a number of the balance sheet and other changes had already started to take place. Hence, by the time we got to the beginning of this year, all banks were meeting their LCR requirement, generally with a reasonable buffer. To remind you, the LCR requires that banks hold enough high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover their projected net cash outflows (NCOs) in a 30-day stress scenario. Banks are required to calculate and maintain an LCR of at least 100 per cent every day. In other words, absent severe market disruption, the LCR is to be met all the time, not just at the end of a quarter (say). While banks undertake extensive modelling to project their cash flows, there is some inherent unpredictability and lumpiness in these flows, including around large deposits, as well as some derivative positions. As a result, all banks have decided to maintain a buffer above 100 per cent. To date, the average LCR for the industry has been around 120 per cent with some banks maintaining large buffers.1 To meet the LCR, banks have made changes to both the asset and liability side of their balance sheets. On the liability side, over the past couple of years, there has been little change in the aggregate shares of deposits and wholesale funding, but beneath the surface the changes have been much greater. • Liabilities with high run-off rates under the LCR, such as deposits held by other financial institutions, have been repriced to reflect the fact that they are not particularly attractive forms of funding for a bank. The competition for this sort of deposit has not been particularly intense, indeed the opposite has often been the case, where banks have been happy to see these less sticky forms of funding leave. • In contrast, the competition for deposits with low run-off rates has been particularly intense. Such deposits include those where a customer has a number of different products with the same institution, meaning their deposit is assessed to be stickier. Banks have been willing to pay up for these more stable forms of funding which has seen their relative rate rise. 1 Banks are required to publicly report information on their LCR on a regular basis. BIS central bankers’ speeches 1                                                  
   • Term deposits are now actually “term” deposits and are, for the most part, unbreakable ahead of the maturity date (without at least one month’s notice). In the past, such deposits were often broken ahead of the maturity date with little or no penalty. Similarly, banks have made the pricing of notice-of-withdrawal accounts more attractive to savers, where the investor is required to give the bank advance notice of their intent to withdraw their funds. • Banks have sought to increase the average maturity of their wholesale bond funding. The average maturity of outstanding wholesale bond funding has increased from 3 years to around 3½ years since 2011. • There has been a marked decrease in the use of wholesale funding with a maturity of less than 30 days. This is a particularly unattractive source of funding for the banks, as they need to cover such funding with 100 per cent HQLA. Hence there is little incentive to offer a yield any higher than the yield on HQLA. This is evident in the yield on one-month bank bills. The spread between the one-month bank bill swap rate (BBSW) and OIS declined markedly at the beginning of the year (as I noted on an earlier occasion, this repricing was left to the last minute2) and has generally been low and stable since. At the one month maturity, we see more activity in banks buying back bills that have rolled down to a residual maturity of one month than we do of new issuance. On the asset side, there have also been a number of changes. However, unlike on the liability side, many of these changes took place well ahead of the LCR coming into force at the beginning of this year. We haven’t seen too many changes take place over the past year. The most notable change has been the increased holdings of HQLA by banks. To remind you, securities eligible as high quality liquid assets in the Australian market are Commonwealth and state government paper. Because of the relatively small pool of government paper in Australia, the Reserve Bank provides, for a fee of 15 basis points per annum, a committed liquidity facility (CLF) to address the shortfall in HQLA that can be reasonably held by the banks.3 Assets which can be used to access this facility are assets which are eligible collateral in the Bank’s market operations, as well as selected securities which the RBA has exempted from certain aspects of its related party guidelines. Graph 1 shows the increased holdings by banks of Commonwealth and state paper. The increased share since the end of 2012 is primarily a result of banks increasing their holdings in preparation for the LCR. Currently banks hold just over a quarter of the stock on issue. It is our assessment that if banks were to hold much more of the stock than this, liquidity in the market would run the risk of being impaired. While it is impossible to be too exact in determining where this (il)liquidity threshold is, we do not want to find out the hard way that we have set the required holdings too high and market functioning is impaired. 2 Debelle G (2014), “Liquidity”, Address to the 27th Australasian Finance and Banking Conference, 16 December 2014. 3 The 15 basis points is the annual fee. In the event, the CLF is drawn on a 25 basis point rate is charged. The all-in cost of the facility also needs to take account of the haircut applied to collateral used for the CLF discussed below. 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches                                                  
   Graph 1  Click to view larger Within the overall share of government paper held by the banking system, the share held in state government paper is much higher than it is in the Commonwealth’s paper. APRA maintains an ongoing discussion with banks about how they determine their asset allocation between the various forms of HQLA. Government paper comprises around 40 per cent of banks’ Australian dollar liquidity holdings. The CLF largely makes up the remainder of banks’ available Australian dollar liquidity for LCR purposes (Graph 2). The size of a bank’s CLF is determined by APRA each year as the difference between the banks’ projected Australian dollar net cash outflows and the amount of HQLA that they can reasonably hold. Hence a bank’s annually determined CLF will decline if either their projected net cash outflows decline and/or if the stock of HQLA increases. Over the course of 2015 both these developments have occurred. For 2015, the banking system’s Australian dollar liquidity needs, in terms of their projected net cash outflows plus an appropriate buffer to ensure the LCR remains comfortably above 100 per cent, was assessed by APRA to be $450 billion, while we projected that the banks could reasonably hold $175 billion of HQLA securities. For 2016, system liquidity needs have fallen to $440 billion, even as banks’ balance sheets have expanded. This is because banks have sought to reduce their net cash outflows by the adjustments to their liabilities I described earlier. At the same time, based on Commonwealth and state government budgets, we project that the stock of HQLA securities that the banks can reasonably hold will rise by $20 billion by end 2016. As a result the size of the 2016 CLF will decline from $275 billion to $245 billion. BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  
   Graph 2   Click to view larger Graph 3 shows the composition of the CLF collateral that the banking system holds. Self-securitised assets comprise the bulk of the assets held. This is another area of ongoing discussion between APRA and the banks. Other assets held are primarily bank-issued paper. These assets are all held on the balance sheets of the relevant bank. They are not “pre-positioned” or held on the balance sheet of the Reserve Bank, as is sometimes the case in other jurisdictions. Graph 3  Click to view larger 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   Moreover, the assets are subject to a haircut in terms of the amount of liquidity they can potentially generate. For example, the haircut on a self-securitised mortgage-backed security is typically more than 20 per cent, depending on various features of the security. That is $100 of such a security could potentially access no more than $80 of liquidity through the CLF. In contrast, $100 of an Australian government bond can be sold for $100 of cash. While such assets generally reside on the balance sheet of an individual bank, in stressed circumstances, when the CLF is activated, the assets will be repoed to the Reserve Bank. To manage this contingent risk, it is very important that we have detailed information about the quality of such assets and are also able to price them accurately to determine the amount of liquidity we would potentially provide against them. To enhance the information available to us, since the middle of 2015, mandatory reporting requirements came into effect for asset-backed securities to be repo eligible with the Reserve Bank and also to be eligible collateral for the CLF. The required information includes key transactional level data, detailed tranche information, and the relationships between trusts and service providers including who is providing various facilities such as a fixed to floating swap. At the loan level, required data for RMBS include: 62 loan fields such as loan balances, interest rates, arrears measures; 18 borrower fields such as borrower income, employment type, whether they are an investor or owner-occupier, whether they are a first home-buyer; and 13 collateral fields (that is, detail on the collateral underpinning the mortgage) including postcode and property valuation. These requirements include data that are commonly used by ratings agencies and RMBS investors, but the data go beyond that to also include some useful information that has not been commonly compiled before, such as offset balances and borrower income at origination. This allows us, along with other investors in asset-backed securities, to undertake a richer analysis of such securities and more accurately assess their risk and pricing than may have been possible before. In our case, it allows us to undertake our own risk assessment and not be dependent on rating agencies. In addition to these data fields, issuers are also required to provide a working cash flow waterfall model of the security which can provide useful information about structural aspects of ABS in some cases only previously obtainable through a detailed reading of legal documentation. This innovation has been very useful in standardising information across securities, allowing us to verify structural features of deals and provide more granular haircuts and pricing than was the case previously. These reporting requirements are standardised for all repo-eligible asset-backed securities, meaning that the same information is required for all securities. As a result, going forward, it will be easier to compare securities. We see this as being of great benefit to the industry as a whole, as does the industry itself, as evidenced by the support of the Australian Securitisation Forum (ASF) through the whole process of introducing these new standards. The repo-eligibility requirements also direct issuers to make the information available to investors and other permitted users, not just to the Reserve Bank. By and large, the information provided to these groups is the same as that provided to the Reserve Bank; however, there have been some fields where the information provided posed a potential risk to privacy. Hence issuers may redact some particular fields and provide aggregated de-individualised data about these fields instead. Since the middle of this year, we have received into our securitisation system around 1 600 submissions, covering around $400 billion in assets, including around two million individual housing loans. The information is updated on a monthly frequency so we are gaining not only a much richer view of the ABS market at any point in time, but also a rich time series. With this very large panel data set we can examine how the market, and the underlying collateral, evolves through time. BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  
   With the caveat that the data reporting is still in its infancy, it’s already apparent that there are many potential benefits of the data. Let me illustrate some of the summary information that we can glean from the first few months of reporting. As noted earlier, these data cover around 2 million housing loans of the total of the approximately 6 million such loans on issue currently. Graph 4 shows the loan to value ratio (LVR) at origination and currently. The largest share of loans had an LVR at origination of between 70 and 80 per cent. While that is still the case in terms of the current LVR, the share is noticeably lower. Similarly, there are almost no loans with an LVR greater than 90 per cent, even though around nearly 10 per cent had an LVR greater than 90 at origination. That said, it should be borne in mind that securitised loans tend to be more seasoned than non-securitised loans and are therefore amortising more quickly. The seasoning (time since loan origination) of the securitised loans is shown in Graph 5. It shows that 95 per cent of the value of loans is more than one year old, and nearly 75 per cent is more than three years old. Graph 4  Click to view larger Graph 5  Click to view larger 6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   One issue which is of some interest currently is the extent of the repayment buffer that has been built up by borrowers. This is shown in Graph 6 which shows that two-thirds of borrowing is covered by a repayment buffer of at least one month’s worth of required mortgage payments, and for half of this, that buffer is more than one year. As the time series on this loan feature accumulates it has the potential to be useful information for monetary policy as well as financial stability considerations. Graph 7 shows the level of documentation for loans securitised by different types of lender. It shows that the major banks have a minimal share of low doc loans in their pools, whereas for the non-bank issuers the share is considerably larger.4 Graph 6  Click to view larger Graph 7  Click to view larger 4 Though the latter have other features which provide increased credit support. BIS central bankers’ speeches 7                                                  
   Finally, in terms of credit risks, Graph 8 shows arrears rates by states and shows that the current distribution of arrears are consistent with the variation in economic conditions across the states, though at the same time all arrears rates are relatively low. Graph 8  Click to view larger  Of course, credit risk is not so much about the averages but the distributions. Having the loan level data enables an insight into the characteristics of the loans in the various tails of the distribution that warrant closer attention. It will also allow an assessment of the correlations between the various drivers of risk that may lead to credit deterioration. In sum, there is very rich potential in these data for many purposes for the RBA and other market participants. From our point of view, the data provide us with a great deal of insight into the contingent risk that might at some point reside on our balance sheet. But clearly, the data are also very useful for financial stability and monetary policy considerations too. Conclusion To conclude, as we approach one year of the full implementation of the LCR in Australia, it is worth looking at some of the changes that have occurred. There has been repricing of liabilities to reflect the differences in their treatment under the LCR. On the asset side, there have been increased holdings of government paper. The banking system’s contingent use of the CLF will decrease in 2016 from 2015 as banks have made adjustments to lower their net cash outflows, which increases their resiliency to funding shocks. This has occurred even as bank balance sheets have continued to expand. While the LCR is now well established in the local market, the net stable funding ratio (NFSR) is yet to be implemented and APRA will be consulting on this next year. This is also likely to have an impact on the composition of bank balance sheets. The enhanced reporting of information on asset-backed securities that commenced in the middle of the year is providing the Bank and market participants with a wealth of standardised information on this part of the market. It is allowing the Bank to enhance its risk assessment of its contingent liability under the CLF, by providing us with a very granular insight into the collateral that is held against the CLF. The data are beneficial not only for this reason but also have the potential to inform assessments of financial stability and provide insight into one important transmission channel of monetary policy. 8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   Gent Sejko: Rethinking economic policies and central banks’ methodologies Speech by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the 9th Workshop of Economic Research in Southeastern Europe, Tirana, 4 December 2015. *      *      * Distinguished guests, Workshop participants, Ladies and Gentlemen I consider it a privilege to address you all for the opening of the 9th South Eastern European Economic Workshop, here in Tirana. In line with the tradition of this event, we once again attempt to complement the need for research with the need for policy novelties. Please allow me to say that judging from the contributions and the presence in this workshop, I am confident that this event will fulfill its commitments and expectations and provide all of us with useful and practical lessons. It is important to emphasize the global and national economic background in which this event takes place and these are very difficult times. The global recession remains present. The European core was shaken not only by events in Greece, but also in Spain, Portugal and Italy, and remains fragile. The recent developments from the Middle East will add to hardships and overstretch available resources. Therefore, economic activity might take a longer time to return to its previous glorious days. Despite the fact that our region has managed to remain on the positive side of economic growth, the hardships were quick to reach us as well. Economic and income growth is not what it used to be and inflation continues to break new low records. Central banking has received its share of challenges and hardships as well. Continuous standard monetary policy easing was coupled with micro and macroprudential policy interventions. Even interventions like quantitative-easing in the euro area were brought into attention and implemented, but still the general economy seems slow to react properly. Furthermore, the issue is not about monetary policy alone. The non-standard interventions (micro and macroprudential policies) require special attention and resource allocation in order to properly manage their implementation and impact on the general economy. Additionally, maintaining financial stability requires additional central bank to prevent possible negative spillovers from the financial sector toward other areas of the economy. In short, the general economic difficulties have placed central banking at a cross-road in relation to its principles, policies and management. Moreover, even though the requirement to maintain price stability remains appealing, dangers do not occur only from inflation. Exchange rate fluctuations have provided additional hazards, particularly within economies where foreign currency transactions dominate. Additionally, financial stability challenges are present even at higher levels. Credit demand reaction to continuous monetary policy stimulus has been sluggish, reflecting the poor expectations of consumers and enterprises on future developments. Supplementary easing of the general requirements for obtaining credits did not have the expected impact and that can be observed in the recent dynamics of aggregate demand components. Unquestionably, financial agents are into profit making and it is their duty to search and find alternative clients if the traditional end-users are unwilling or uncommitted to new credit. Besides that, the need for financing will stimulate end-users to search and find alternative sources. This raises the question at more strategic levels associated with credit efficiency allocation and informality. Allocation deficiencies tend to intensify in times of crises reflecting usually a condition of over-lending in certain sectors, which are most probably with poor spillover effects on the rest of the economy. In the meantime, the sectors that are truly productive might remain detached from financial sources, thus with little stimulus to move forward. Even worse, these BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   sectors might address to informal lenders to compensate for their financial needs. This is also an activity that booms in times of crisis and, since these activities are entirely unmonitored by financial regulators, they could dangerously harm and diminish the ability of financial regulators to influence the economy at large. Having mentioned all these arguments, I would like to return to our event and emphasize how the challenges mentioned above are translated into challenges for central banking research. I am most glad that all issues have been addressed at the different panels of this workshop. Additionally, although we are yet to hear them, I am most confident that the policy implications suggested in these contributions are relevant and important. The question remains: are they practical and can they be easily adapted? This question involves the major challenge for research both at this workshop, and in general. It is your duty to provide a balance between the academic properties of research and its practical endeavors. The academic properties will guarantee a standard of research enriched with methodological novelties and points of view. Furthermore, the practical patterns would allow policy makers to fully and easily implement your policy proposals making them relevant. This is the main expectation that I have from this event and I am confident it will be fulfilled at the end of these two days. Without further ado, I would like to give a warmly welcome and congratulate you all for your good work and for being here today. Thank you. 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   Daniel Mminele: Challenges today – opportunities tomorrow Keynote address by Mr Daniel Mminele, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the African Central Bank Reserves Management 2020 Conference, Arusha, 1 December 2015. *      *      * Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is indeed a privilege to have been invited to deliver the keynote address at this prestigious African Central Bank Reserves Management Conference. I would like to thank the Bank of Tanzania, Allianz Global Investors, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) for affording me the opportunity to share some thoughts regarding the challenges and opportunities we face in managing official reserves. Thank you also for creating this valuable opportunity to discuss and swap notes on best reserve management practices. The ever-changing landscape in the financial markets poses significant and exciting challenges for reserves managers, but change can also bring new opportunities, which could require a rethink in the way that central bankers manage official reserves. As is always the case with change, new risks also emerge. This is even the case when considering only the primary objective of capital preservation, for which historically there were seemingly simple solutions. In the not so distant past, there was a clear formula for achieving capital preservation by placing deposits with AAA– rated counterparties or buying highly rated government bonds. However, holding government bonds in the current environment may not necessarily guarantee capital preservation. For instance, in countries such as Germany, negative yields prevailing in the short to medium maturity notes actually guarantee not being able to achieve capital preservation. How to deal with negative interest rates is just one of the challenges we face as reserves managers. Judging by the structure of the agenda and the speakers for this conference, I have no doubt that many other issues will be unpacked, to help enhance our understanding as we grapple with these extraordinary economic circumstances that have created today’s trying conditions under which reserves managers have to operate. In my remarks this morning, I will touch briefly on the global economic and financial markets context; then talk about recent developments in reserves management, and the challenges currently facing central bank reserve managers. Before exploring, towards the end of my remarks, possible opportunities stemming from this changing global landscape, as we cast our eyes out to 2020, I will briefly share with you how we at the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) have been thinking about and approaching these challenges. Recent economic and market trends Due to the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, there was coordinated global easing in monetary policy in an effort to boost the global economy. Given the severity of the crisis, it is probably fair to say that investors and other market participants had believed this would remain the policy stance for a protracted period. But the game changer came in May 2013 with what is now commonly referred to as the ‘taper tantrum’, when the then Fed Chair, Ben Bernanke, indicated that the authorities may consider reducing the pace of asset purchases. This was the starting point of markets needing to adjust to a world of diverging monetary policies. Since then, the Federal Reserve has entirely ceased with its asset purchases by slowly reducing its monthly purchases to zero from December 2013 to October 2014. Subsequently, the debate shifted to the timing of the rate hiking cycle. While the United States (US) has BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   shown sound economic performance amid resurgent domestic spending, and indications by the monetary authorities of the need to reduce the accommodative stance in interest rates, the market chose to focus on the lack of consumer and wage inflation. Consequently, there was a divergence between the indication from Fed officials and the market pricing about the expected path of interest rates, adding uncertainty and volatility to the market. More recently, labour market statistics and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communication has seen the market move to bring forward its rate hike expectations, with the chance of a December hike now priced at around 74 per cent. During this period of uncertainty in the US markets, the European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on quantitative easing with consequential negative interest rates. On 18 November 2015, Germany issued 2-year bonds at a record low of –38 basis points! The spread of the US 10-year yield over the equivalent maturity German bond is now trading around 175 basis points, close to its historic high of 190 basis points. At the same time, China’s process of transitioning to a more domestic, consumption-driven economy from one that is investment-led and relies heavily on exports, was a major factor in slowing down its overall economic growth. We are all acutely aware that this slowdown adversely affected commodity prices and export-driven countries, which has severe repercussions for emerging-market economic growth, including on the African continent. In addition, the falling oil prices, partially due to downward revisions to Chinese growth expectations, contributed to keeping inflation tame and adding to the deflation dilemma in some developed markets. Today, we therefore face divergent monetary policies, with the US on the verge of increasing interest rates, likely to be followed by the United Kingdom next, while the Eurozone and Japan are set to continue with looser monetary policies. This dichotomy presents reserves managers with a clear dilemma: investments in US treasuries may produce negative returns during an interest rate hiking cycle. At the same time, with reserves generally reported in US dollars, non-US dollar investments are expected to underperform in response to an expected stronger US dollar. This is of course adding to the complexity faced in global policy-making and investor decision-making.  Trends in reserves management With the investment environment clearly becoming more complicated, it may be useful to review recent trends in reserves management, both globally as well as on the continent. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data, global foreign-exchange reserves (excluding gold and Special Drawing Rights (SDR) increased from US$2,5 trillion to US$8,3 trillion, or 332 by per cent, in the ten years to 2014. Over the same period, total foreign-exchange reserves in Africa increased from US$81,9 billion to US$271,8 billion, or 331 per cent. This sudden increase in reserve accumulation did not happen in isolation. The increased globalisation of economic relationships brought with it the requirement for holding additional reserves. This as many of the reserves adequacy metrics will involve the ratio of either trade data or debt levels to gross domestic product. Consequently, as economies open up, so their required reserve holdings need to increase. Such strong growth in reserve holdings brought with it a number of changes in reserves management practices. According to the April 2015 HSBC Reserve Management Trends Survey, conducted in association with Central Banking Publications, central banks continue to focus on diversification into non-traditional markets, such as Australia, Canada, Scandinavia and, recently, China. Central bank respondents to the survey expect that the Chinese Renminbi will reach 10 per cent of global reserves by 2025. In terms of asset classes, more than 20 per cent of central banks are either investing now or considering investment into emerging-market bonds and equities. Furthermore, more than 10 per cent of the respondents indicated that either they are investing now or considering investment into exchange-traded funds. 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   Interestingly, the survey also points out that about 70 per cent of central banks are active in, or considering, securities lending. Based on our interactions with colleagues in other central banks on the continent, the recent focus among African reserves managers has been on: (i) formalising the investment decision processes; (ii) introducing the use of bond futures for efficient portfolio management; and (iii) investigating the viability of including Chinese bonds, onshore and/or offshore, into their reserves portfolios. Work currently under way under the auspices of the Committee of Central Bank Governors of the South African Development Community (SADC) indicates convergence in reserves management practices in this sub-region of Africa. The initial research results show that reserve management activity in the region is governed by proper policies and guidelines, and nearly all central banks have adopted strategic asset allocation (SAA) frameworks. It also notes that there is a general approach of using tranching when constructing reserve portfolios. The SAA framework determines tranche sizes where relevant. Most central banks invest in cash, cash equivalents and fixed income instruments, with the US dollar and the euro being common currencies in all portfolios. Challenges facing reserves managers With that contextual backdrop, and before moving on to discuss some of the challenges faced by reserves managers, it is worth reflecting on one of the consequences of the global financial crisis that we are still grappling with today. This is the deterioration in the credit quality of the reserve currencies. Since 2008, using Standard & Poor’s ratings, we have seen the Japanese government debt being downgraded from AA to A+ and the US drop from AAA to AA+. Within Europe, while Germany has remained AAA-rated, France was downgraded from AAA to AA and peripheral European countries such as Spain (from AAA to BBB+) and Portugal (from AA- to BB) saw an even more dramatic drop in their ratings. This narrowed the high-grade investment universe, requiring, in some instances, adjustments in investment guidelines to accommodate these changes. With issuers consequently falling outside the traditional investment universe, finding yield-enhancing assets became more difficult. These challenges persist and with the continued subdued global economic growth outlook are unlikely to go away anytime soon. Moving on to developments that are more recent, and with reference to my earlier discussion on diverging monetary policies, the key challenges that reserves managers have been facing since the latter part of 2013 have been around the ongoing uncertainties on the timing of the rise in US interest rates and the negative yields in Europe. This has required reserves managers to take stock of their SAA as well as review their tactical strategies.  For central banks with low reserves, the SAA tends to be set along the currency patterns of their foreign trade and external debt. While debt obligations tend to be dollar based, trade patterns can vary more significantly. I remarked earlier that all SADC central banks have euros in their portfolio, which reflects the importance of this region to the continent. However, central banks typically invest in maturities up to three-years, and this part of the German yield curve has negative yields of around 40bps. For countries with larger reserve holdings, there are opportunities to enhance returns through lengthening the maturity of investments or adding credit risk to the portfolio. However, such strategies in turn bring additional market and credit risk to the portfolio, potentially coming into conflict with the overarching objective of capital preservation. With expectations of higher interest rates in the US, the dollar has strengthened and investors have started to shy away from investing in commodities, including gold. According to Bloomberg, the amount of gold held in exchange-traded funds has dropped from 2,633 tonnes in late 2012 to 1,494 tonnes in November 2015. There has been a striking correlation between the gold held by these funds with the dollar price of gold. Gold holdings in these funds are still substantially higher than pre-2008 levels and therefore there is a risk BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  
   of further unwind. For South Africa, the decline in the gold price has seen the dollar value of gold holdings decline from US$ 7,1 billion in September 2012 to US$ 4,6 billion at the end of October 2015. Another consequence of the global financial crisis was a significant tightening in the regulatory framework. The new regulatory environment (introduction of Basel III and Dodd-Frank) in financial markets has raised concerns about liquidity, especially in fixed income markets. The concerns stem from the fact that many global investment banks and market makers are adjusting their balance sheets, and consequently their business operating models, in order to comply with these new regulations and deal with the associated costs structures. As reserves managers, we should be acutely aware of how market liquidity develops so that we are confident that we will be able to convert assets into cash when required. The risk is that it is exactly in crisis times when central banks may need to tap into reserves, and it is in crisis times that market liquidity tends to disappear.  Finally, we should not overlook the role of technology, which is another challenge reserves manager are dealing with. With the growing complexity of the investment environment reserves managers are required to enhance their analytical skills and capabilities, but the increasing cost of technology could stand in the way of a proper assessment of the long-term benefits of such essential investment. This is particularly important for central banks diversifying into new assets classes across various currencies and instruments. It is essential for reserves managers to invest in prime technology in order to receive an optimal risk-adjusted return and reduce the probability of negative returns. At the SARB, we are keenly aware of the benefits and risks associated with new technology, a subject I will return to in a moment. The South African Reserve Bank’s response to these challenges One of the steps the SARB took when thinking about how best to deal with expected higher rates in the US was to include the use of bond futures in its investment guidelines in order to provide an efficient way to protect the internally managed bond portfolios invested in the US and other major markets. Secondly, the SAA was diversified to allow investment into currencies of some of the high credit-rated and liquid bonds from markets with low debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratios. For the SARB, this meant fixed income investments in Canada, Sweden, South Korea, and China. The diversification into the Chinese onshore bond market was a result of a strategic view on the long-term outlook for the role of China in the global economy and its economic relations with South Africa. The Chinese bond market also offered good yields together with diversification benefits that have proved to be very valuable. In addition to the diversification of our currency universe, the SARB included high-rated covered bonds and mortgage-backed securities in the SAA in order to diversify the sources of return and reduce the negative impact of rising rates on the overall portfolio. Other strategies employed by the SARB to reduce external vulnerability and ensure access to foreign exchange in times of stress included negotiating swap lines with the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) and the Contingent Reserve Agreement among the BRICS nations. Lastly, the SARB is making considerable investments in improving technology by acquiring new systems and staff capacity so as to future-proof the reserves management function. We have undertaken a comprehensive review of our system architecture used in the management of gold and foreign-exchange reserves. To this end, we have decided to replace our existing IT system with a new one, more appropriate to our current and future needs, so as to enhance the reserves management value chain. 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   Potential opportunities for reserves managers What opportunities does the current environment provide when we think about the next five years or so? Firstly, the prospect of higher rates in the US will provide an opportunity for reserves managers to invest in higher yielding but safer investments. The indication by the FOMC that it intends to raise rates at a measured pace should help manage the risk of negative portfolio returns. As central banks tend to invest in short maturity bonds with a duration of three years or shorter, a ‘sweet spot’ may exist in that when rates are expected to increase modestly, longer maturity investors may shorten durations in order to avoid losses, keeping the short end of the yield curve somewhat supported. As the bulk of global reserves are held in US dollars, there is no doubt that after some initial mark-to-market losses, higher rates will in due course increase the yield in the portfolio. Here it becomes important for reserves managers to focus on the investment horizon, and not on annual financial accounting outcomes. After the global financial crisis, bond yields in the developed economies became highly correlated as these countries added stimulus to their economies in order to avoid, among other things, deflation. Consequently, risk adjusted returns of portfolios invested in advanced economies were depressed owing to the loss of diversification benefits. The current diverging monetary policies may in future provide diversification benefits, which will improve the risk-adjusted returns of the overall portfolio of reserves.  Furthermore, African countries have improved in respect of overall political and economic stability, thus providing possible opportunities for long-term stable investments. As these countries provide both hard and domestic currency investments, the weaker exchange rates could now be providing entry points for reserves managers who may want to diversify their investments and benefit from the higher yields. Likewise, the devaluation of the Chinese Renminbi in recent years may have created an opportunity for reserves managers to enter the market at a more favourable exchange rate. With the Chinese authorities taking steps to support economic growth and recent measures announced to further internationalise the Renminbi, the Renminbi is likely to become more attractive. The most recent reforms have certainly made things a lot easier for central banks in particular. In this light, and with the Renminbi set to be included into the IMF’s SDR basket from October next year, following approval by the IMF executive board yesterday, central banks and other official institutions are likely to include this currency into their reserves portfolios (or increase current holdings). An opinion piece by Jukka Pihlman in yesterday’s Financial Times pointed to the potential significant demand for Renminbi, estimating that even a conservative one per cent reallocation of global reserves each year would result in inflows of about USD80bn annually. Amid the lack of allure of traditional government bonds, which could be in play in the foreseeable future, alternative instruments and assets, such as equities, could feature in future SAAs. Some research has shown that improved capital preservation, while generating somewhat higher returns, is on offer from equities relative to bonds. But any broad based moves into equities will be highly country-specific. Concluding remarks There can be no doubt that the game has changed for central bank reserves managers. The fast changing world and investment landscape is requiring of reserves managers to adapt to a playing field that is characterised by high levels of uncertainty and volatility, resulting in the need to reconsider investment strategies on a more frequent basis. This will necessitate SAA processes that are vigilant and rigorous. Old and trusted assets are not yielding returns and some are even eroding capital. New instruments and assets that fall within the familiar and accepted investment universe are not plentiful. BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  
   Reserves managers must keenly evaluate factors such as investment time horizons, what constitutes and acceptable risk-return balance, what role alternatives should play alongside traditional asset classes, and whether our traditional benchmarks still fit it in with new strategies. However, at all times reserves managers must also remember that they are custodians of public funds, and have to be guided by prudent strategies, which implies that there must be a limit to “thinking outside the box” in the quest for ever higher returns. Dealing with these challenges will certainly require human capital that is appropriately skilled, and equipped with the right technology. Conferences such as this one present a unique opportunity to share experiences, and transfer skills and knowledge among African central banks, as it brings together central banks with private-sector players, and development institutions, a uniquely powerful combination. I understand that the conference is the culmination of two years of work involving members of the East African Community. I would encourage the organisers to find ways of sustaining this momentum. Finally, I trust that you will leave Arusha with better insights and an improved network of contacts in the central banking community to help you navigate the future as you strengthen reserves management practices in your own environments to the benefit of your respective central banks and countries. Enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you. 6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Of ironies and synergy Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the First ASEAN Corporate Governance Conference and Awards “Governance Transformation in ASEAN: Reform and Priorities”, Manila, 14 November 2015. *      *      * Can self-interest lead to the greater good? Prior to Adam Smith1  it was counter-intuitive to say, “Yes.” Human nature, in its narrowest sense, if you must, is anathema to the proposition that individuals naturally uphold the common good. But proceeding from Smith’s theory, we tap individuals’ natural inclination to pursue their own interests. We motivate them to see that good governance works to their benefit. Self-interest therefore is channelled to nationally desirable ends. Another “irony” results - supervised entities are now competing to adopt good governance principles! In doing so, there is cooperation with regulated entities. Competition toward cooperation. This provokes another thought: Can the regulator partner with the regulated? I believe so. When standards are merely imposed from the top-down, results can be unsustainable. To have sustainability, interests of the regulator and the regulated must converge. Can more granular measurement lead to unlimited possibilities? In the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), I believe the answer is “yes”. Since its initiation four years ago under the ACMF Implementation Plan, the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (ACGS) has raised awareness for tangible benefits of good governance practices among publicly listed companies. The Scorecard has become increasingly more than a compliance metric or tick-box. Rather, it is now a tool to achieve organizational alignment and focus.2 OECD studies show that investors have greater confidence in firms whose governance standards are measured and clearly understood, consequently allowing better access to equity and debt finance3, leading to reduced cost of capital4, and thus translating to improved share value5. These are goals both regulators and the regulated desire. Since the initiative began in 2011, regulators have championed good governance principles. It is for “your own good,” we say. And, we have not been off-the-mark in our pronouncement. Our advocacy has been heard. McKinsey has found that boards of directors of corporations are increasingly “more confident in their knowledge of the companies they serve and more strategic in their approach.” And we know that strategy formulation is the first step to good governance.6 Also, as shown in an ADB study7, PLCs have begun to voluntarily adopt best practices. There is greater appreciation that a balanced scorecard can generate firm-level                                                 1  Paraphrasing an idea in Adam Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759). 2  “Robert S.

   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  governance improvements8 and attract foreign investments. Ultimately, these enhance the region’s visibility, integrity and “branding” as an asset class. The impact of good corporate governance is not just on the micro. It is also on the macro. There is evidence that improvements in corporate governance of firms positively affect aggregate economic activities at the country, and in our case, regional levels. Studies show this is especially so when firms improve transparency. When firms are better governed, interests of the firm and of stakeholders are more closely aligned. This gives firms stronger incentives to achieve high productivity and efficiency, thereby raising “economy-wide” productivity growth.9 Success inspires more success and good governance results in the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. In terms of corporate governance, ASEAN has certainly come a long way since the 1997 financial crisis. OECD reports that many key financial and corporate institutional reforms here have translated to “stronger regulation, better resourced regulators, new institutions and an increasingly involved shareholder base.” A key facet of this positive development is corporate governance reform.10 Moreover, as the ACMF effort has reached its fourth year, we have a better understanding of corporate governance standards across the region. As regulators, we now have a common diagnostic tool to help us improve corporate governance standards. Each country in the region is expected to build on these standards to create their own corporate governance framework, which should clearly articulate expectations on (among others) the fitness and propriety of the board, checks and balances, and transparency. The fundamental principle is that the tone of good governance should be set and come from the top. It should remain the highest priority as it emphasizes the importance of having “fit and proper” standards for individual board members. These standards, we believe, should put as much weight on integrity, as on knowledge, expertise and competence. Fitness and propriety are also displayed in the exercise of independent and objective judgment. The “state” of independence is defined by parameters on term limits, a cap on the number of concurrent independent directorships and the challenge of a seemingly limited number of qualified independent directors. Systems of checks and balances should likewise be deeply embedded across all levels in the company. Unquestionably, an environment that fosters transparency should be the new norm. A system for cooperation and collaboration among government bodies, regulators, and supervisors should be in place to ensure reasonableness of disclosure requirements. We must display the will and capacity to implement standards and take enforcement actions, if needed. A business model that often draws discussion and one that is almost always associated with our region – is related party interest. While we recognize that such a corporate structure has inherent risks, we must also be mindful that synergies can lead to success of individual companies. It would therefore be beneficial to set higher oversight and control standards. This, to address conflict of interest concerns and propriety of related transactions. Our own efforts at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas with respect to our supervised entities follow the global thrust closely, while at the same time being mindful of emerging domestic industry concerns and unique situations in our legal and regulatory environments. However, regulation                                                 8  Chris Razook, Corporate Governance Challenges Facing Southeast Asia, The Ethical Boardroom, Spring 2015.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  alone is not enough. A culture that induces appropriate/proper behavior, even when nobody is watching, is needed. Ladies and gentlemen, the scope of governance must be broad. Our initiatives must not begin and end with PLCs only. The financial environment where PLCs operate is made up of many moving parts. Efforts must extend to financial market segments as well. In particular, we must promote orderly financial markets that feature real price discovery and enforce responsible market conduct. From the perspective of a central bank, we view good corporate governance as the foundation of safe and sound banking operations. It embodies principles of fairness, accountability and transparency. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasizes that since banks have an important financial intermediation role in the economy, the public and the market must be highly sensitive to any difficulties potentially arising from any corporate governance shortcomings in banks.11 Clearly, the financial industry thrives on public trust to sustain resiliency. But I believe these principles are true not just for the banking sector but for all commercial endeavors as well. We should also recognize that SMEs make significant contributions to regional growth. Thus, they should be included in our continuing transformation process. This transformation should also not leave consumer protection behind. Ladies and gentlemen, governance must be inclusive.  For certain, we give credit to ACMF for identifying good corporate governance as a prerequisite for economic and financial integration. In doing so, ACMF strategically built a strong foundation for our single market of ten separate economies. Good corporate governance as a bedrock is essential for an economy whose combined GDP is expected to grow 4 times to US $10 trillion by 203012 and is projected to become the 4th largest in the world by 2050.13 With this forecast, we are therefore beginning strong with that trajectory in mind. Diversity in ASEAN is a good thing. It suggests availability of niche markets that can be tapped. Different needs can be explored and met. Pockets of expertise can be harnessed.14 Each nation has a comparative advantage that will benefit the others. Regardless of our differences, we should work together to continually make the Scorecard reflect internationally recognized good practices in a manner that remains relevant and applicable to ASEAN. This can be done through systematic collaboration, to ensure cohesion and promote synergy. As each nation is here represented, I am confident we are off to an auspicious and productive start. But can there be constancy amidst change? The answer, I would say, is “yes.” This year, the Philippine SEC celebrates its 79th Founding Anniversary. Its core functions endure, yet it also makes history by launching the Philippine Corporate Governance Blueprint. In crafting the plan, I understand that the SEC convened a multi-sectoral consultative working group, which considered past, present and changing requirements of corporate governance, while remaining sensitive to nuances of the domestic market. For this endeavor, we congratulate the Philippine SEC and its proactive and tireless Chairperson, my friend and colleague, Honorable Teresita Herbosa. We look forward to the Blueprint’s introduction.                                                 11  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,Consultative Document.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  My final thoughts for this morning. For sustainability of the corporate governance initiative, achieving synergy among seeming ironies is the challenge. Self-interest toward the greater good, Competition toward cooperation, Partnerships between regulators and the regulated, Unity in diversity, Consistency amidst change. In addressing these seeming ironies, balance is key. Balance in choosing a firm regulatory stance, while respecting and giving a wide berth to what motivates PLCs and individual firms. I believe we are on the right track. As we fulfill our mandate as the country’s central monetary authority, and as member of the Philippine Financial Sector Forum – comprised of financial regulators, we stand one with you in the vision to make ASEAN an “asset class” of its own. On behalf of the Monetary Board and the officers and staff of the BSP and the Financial Sector Forum, I congratulate the ACMF, and the fifty PLCs of the region, inaugural award recipients of the ASEAN Corporate Governance Award. For being exemplar in your way of governance, and being the elite first of many batches that will bring more investments and growth into our region, we warmly applaud you. As we say in the vernacular, maraming salamat and mabuhay po tayong lahat.  
   Arjuna Mahendran: Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s 65th anniversary Speech by Mr Arjuna Mahendran, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the commemorating ceremony of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s 65th anniversary, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Colombo, 28 August 2015. *      *      * Today is a very important day for all of us. 65 years is not a small period in the life of an institution and first and foremost I must thank all of you who have kept the torch of central banking alive and well in Sri Lanka over the last 65 years. I know most of you haven’t been here for that length of time but certainly those traditions have been passed on to you and you are I think preserving them very well and making sure that they are moving on into the next generations’ hands in good condition. At this point, we should take a step back and look at what we have achieved in those 65 years. First of all, when we were established in 1950, the statute that enabled the establishment of this institution was very clear, in-terms of its objectives and that statute has more or less remained unchanged in that whole period, which I think in Sri Lankan terms is quite a record. There haven’t been significant amendments to the Monetary Law Act in that period and our objectives still remain the same; the control of inflation, the promotion of financial stability and banking sector and financial system stability and the thrust for a broader economic development of the whole country, that in a nutshell is what our objectives are, which is very clear, its unambiguous and it has kept us on the straight and narrow path through some fairly challenging periods. I think there are very few central banks in the world that have gone through the sort of events that we have been through, most notably the bomb blast which you know affected us, the physical lives of several of our colleagues and their families and such like over the years. And that was related obviously to the civil strives that this country went through for almost thirty years. Nevertheless I think the central bank has maintained financial stability, we have kept inflation reasonably under control, and the economic development of the country has done reasonably well despite those challenges, which is in no small measure due to the efforts of successive generations of central bankers who have stuck to their principles by and large and kept the momentum of the country moving forward. So it is appropriate for us to take a moment and just accept a little bit of self-congratulation at this point of time. And certainly, my endeavor is to see that we promote these noble ideals and take the country and this institution to even higher heights, now that we have peace in this country and a lot of those hurdles that the central bank faced in the last three decades are behind us and we have to gear ourselves to promote those objectives of this institution in relatively normal circumstances in the future. To do this, we now have to assess what those three objectives of ours mean in the broader sense and I have been reaching out to some of you over the last six months in this regard. First of all, when we look at the control of inflation, I think that has been fortuitously resolved by external events. You can see that in the global markets we have falling commodity prices worldwide. The large country that has appeared in the last decade, China, has indulged in a lot of spending in the last ten years to revive the global economy and in the process, commodity prices shot up which caused no small measure of problems for us. But now, that spending boom is over and as you can see, China’s growth is slowing down. And as a consequence, we also benefit from falling commodity prices and therefore our inflation is easier to control. On the financial stability front, I would say that the banking system looks in reasonably good shape. That is partly because banks have been extremely conservative in the last twenty to thirty years because of the war situation and they did not lend aggressively. More recently we saw some of them becoming a little aggressive and they got a bit burned when agriculture BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   was affected by the drought last year. Then you saw the big exposure to gold and pawning activities which also affected bank balance sheets slightly. Most of those problems I am glad to say, seem to be behind us. So the banking system looks in fairly good shape. Finance companies pose some concerns and. I think we have far too many of them. We were a bit too liberal in-terms of encouraging finance company growth in the last ten to fifteen years. As a consequence, today we are coping with some unusual situations in that sector. But there again, with some resolve and some out of the box thinking, we will be able to bring that sector also under control. So all in all, I think the financial system is responding favourably. We have several infrastructural challenges ahead of us so we have to make our stock markets, our bond markets and our foreign currency market work as a market and really respond to the challenges of bringing in more participants, broadening its appeal and becoming real instruments of channeling the savings not only of Sri Lankans but also of people living overseas so that institutions and our real businesses can benefit from those flows of financial activity and grow at a stronger pace than they have grown in the past. That is our broad challenge going forward and at the same time ensuring that we do not allow the sort of excesses that creep in, in such situations which cause financial disturbances and panics. So this is going to be the challenge going forward for all of us, to establish that stability and to have a very clear set of rules. Remember that the way financial markets have evolved historically for centuries is on the basis of having “rule-based” systems, where every player in the market, whether it is the regulator or the regulated, abides by a set of rules. And that is the most effective way for any system to function. It cannot be based on the whims and fancies of the regulator, or the government or any single player in the market. There has to be an even playing field, the goalposts have to be stuck very firmly in the same place and the same rules have to apply, just like game football or cricket. You cannot change the rules as you go along. That to me, is very essential. So at the moment we are trying to make those rules very clear to all the market players in various forms. We have already done so in most of the markets, in the foreign exchange market, in the fixed income markets, and I think the SEC is now trying to establish the rules in the equity market. Once all that comes together I think you will see a significant improvement in the way our entire financial sector operates and hopefully that will be the main conduit for financing of development in the years to come. So this deals more or less with the challenges we have in the financial space and our efforts to ensure financial stability. But really, it is the third objective, which is the economic development of the country that I wish to spend a few minutes on today. This is the area, which, for various reasons central bank has engaged and disengaged over the years and decades. Basically, the bank took a backward step about fifteen to twenty years ago and very understandably so, because that was the time when the war was raging and we had our own problems to contend with, particularly in-terms of ensuring stability. Therefore the central bank did not pursue aggressively a strategy of engaging with the rural sector and with the broad development of the entire country. We more or less stuck to our basic activities in-terms of financial stability optimization and inflation control and economic development objective took a slightly backseat. I think now it is incumbent on us to really re-engage with the government, with all the social sector players, with all sorts of industry groups, agriculture groups, service sector groups and really map the way forward on how this country can grow. When you look at the situation it is not bad, but on the other hand there is a lot of work to be done. Take for instance the fact that the entire Northern Province contributes only 4% of the total national GDP. That is simply unacceptable. We have nine provinces in this country and you cannot have one of them only contributing 4%. That is simply unbalanced, and the opportunity is that we have in Northern Province three branches, in Trincomalee, in Jaffna and now in Kilinochchi, and there is no reason at all why we cannot spur all the banking institutions in Northern Province to come under our umbrella and really see that the economic potential of that region is achieved. It is very simple. We just have to see that the banking institutions and ourselves work on a coordinated basis to look at what resources that area of the country has, 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   whether it is manpower or land that is unutilized, and the agricultural potential. I am not saying that we should only focus on the Northern Province, even the Southern Province. We have a branch in Matara, but I think there is a lot of work to be done. I recently visited areas around Hambanthota, and I find that the potential there really, is still not exploited. There are a few factories here and there, few agricultural projects that we are funding, but we are nowhere near the sort of potential we can achieve particularly since so much infrastructure has been installed in that area and built in recent years. I think that infrastructure is not being used. We have the rather comic situation today where an airport is being used to store paddy because of a mismatch of the needs of that airport to be economical with the needs of the broader economy which has other pressing problems to be achieved. So this is a classic example how we have to put on our thinking caps and come up with solutions for the government. One big advantage that we have is that central bankers have through the decades, manned very important government institutions. Even when I look today, institutions as varied as the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Finance and such like have very senior central bankers working there in some form or another. And even in the legal sector, the Attorney General’s Department is working very closely with us. I think we have a significant role to play in-terms of capacity building not just in the banking sector, but in several other sectors that are vital to the economy. That is the challenge that all of you have to remember and try and participate. I myself, when I worked in these institutions few decades ago, the Ministry of Industries, in the Treasury, it was a very enriching experience personally. But at the same time, I carried over the expertise I had picked up in the Central Bank and enriched those institutions as well. So that tradition should continue and I think it is incumbent on the central bank to really use our manpower. All of you are a concentrated pool of brainpower in this country. I do not think any other institution has so many qualified individuals. We have engineers, we have people from all sorts of fields, not just economics, in this institution, and we have to really build on those skill sets. One of the plans I have, which I am discussing with the DGs, AGs, is to try and deepen our skill sets. We have to identify specific skill sets which are necessary for the central bank in the first instance, and also for the broader nation and to try and deepen those skill sets in a conscious basis so that our manpower development, what you call the improvement of our human capital becomes much more entrenched and becomes much more integrated in-terms of the national economic developmental effort. Just to give you an example, we do not have enough accountants in the government service. When I talk to the police, the CID, the Attorney General’s Department, all these departments they do not have accountants. They cannot analyze when they see a balance sheet in any corporate case, they do not know how to handle it. There is a desperate shortage of manpower, partly because the accountants in this country can get much better salaries when they work for the private sector. Now how do we bridge this gap? I think given that the Central Bank is a very secure service – maybe we do not pay as much as the private sector but we do give security of tenure, you all get EPF and pensions – these sort of long-term prospects will attract good people to this institution on continued basis. I have tried in my own way to fight with the government to get increases in wages for all of us and also reinstating the pension and I hope that will make it much more attractive for people to work for this institution and keep you from moving away into the private sector. But in the process we also have to develop our skill sets and really organize and prepare ourselves for the challenges of the future. The future I think is going to look very different from the past in this country. We are now reaching a level of normalcy which most of us have never experienced in our lifetimes. The year I joined this institution, 1983, was when the problem of the ethnic issue started, unfortunately. And it raged on for almost thirty years. So I do not think any of us have really experienced that normalcy and as a result, people are not really prepared to take on the challenges of what a normal market economy looks like. Hence, it is really incumbent to us, to define for the country, for the government, for the people. And to propagate that message BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  
   we have to be much more forceful in-terms of using the media, whether it is the newspapers, the television or social media, to bring forward views on what we think the future of Sri Lanka will look like. Obviously in consultation with the government, we have people, as I said, in various institutions of government who can coordinate with us to come up with a comprehensive message, and using our annual report and other publications, we can continue to project that report, that view, that map of the future and engage with the government on how that will be achieved, all the while stressing the need for financial stability, the control of inflation and for seeing that economic development takes place in an optimal manner. That I think is really the challenge for us. We have to imagine what the future is going to look like. And at the moment I think this is the best institution to do so. So the challenges are ahead of us. It is not easy to change mindsets. Remember, that a lot of people in this country, particularly those who work for the government have been used to a war situation. For most of their working lives, they have been living in a war economy. A war economy is very different from an economy at peace. That, in my view, is why you had a change of government this year and you have a new government, who is trying to win the peace. We won the war, but it was very difficult to win the peace. Why? Because our mindsets were stuck in the past. There was that concept of control. You had to control everything in the economy including prices. When I say prices, I mean the exchange rates, the interest rates, other prices which affect the functioning of the economy. That is all justifiable in a war situation. But when you come into a peace situation, where it is a normal functioning market economy, then you have to re-think, you have to get back to first principles, and reassess how the economy should work in a new dispensation. That is a challenge before us, and I’m asking all of you to join in this effort to try and redefine the scope of everything we do in the Central Bank, to see that we reorient ourselves towards winning peace in the broader sense, to making the financial sector, the economy and other types of institutions in this country work in an effective manner that can raise the growth, the potential of this economy, raise the skill levels, and most importantly, bring about that ethnic harmony which I think has been amply demonstrated here today in-terms of all religions and faiths coming together and propagating the message of peace and goodwill, at the same time hoping for a better Sri Lanka for us, our children and grandchildren. So with that simple message, I thank you very much for all your efforts. I think the last six months for me have been a very steep learning curve, coming back and reorienting myself with this institution, which is very dear to my heart. I have observed tremendous improvement, in-terms of several processes that were never there when I left this institution in 1993. I find that there is still more to do but I think Sri Lanka as a country has a great potential. We are geographically situated in a location which is at the center of the fastest growing population cohort, globally. As you know, the last twenty to thirty years were the era of China. China grew massively because it had a very fast-growing population. Also the East Asian countries around it, like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong had mounted their economic miracle by opening up their market and making their exchange rates competitive and basically getting huge amounts of foreign investment. That model worked effectively and it is the only model that really is open for emerging markets to prosper. But now they are facing a problem. Their populations have stopped growing so they do not have young, creative workers coming into the workforce in-order to make their economies continue to grow at the fantastic rates of growth they achieved for several decades; 10–12% of rates for economic growth. So now the challenge is for the countries around the Indian Ocean. Particularly the Southern Indian Ocean. The whole SAARC Region including India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, even the Maldives in its own way, and then look at the Middle East, parts of the Middle East which are prospering, particularly the UAE, Oman, Qatar and similar countries and then the whole of the African Continent, which you may or may not know, has about a billion people. This is almost the size of China about ten years ago. If Africa can get going with its vast stores of minerals and other types of natural resources, then you really see a transformation in this part of the world. This part of the Indian Ocean 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   will, I think, really be the fastest growing region in the world in ten years’ time. But we have to be part of that, we have the head start in-terms of human capital. I have travelled this region intensively and nowhere have I found the quality of manpower that you have in Sri Lanka. When I used to go Pakistan ten years ago, all my clients used to tell me that their teachers used to be from Ceylon. We are very famous for our teachers, even in Singapore and all these regional countries, Ceylonese teachers used to go and teach in the 1960s and teach their children how to speak, read and write in English and they have very fond memories of this. This shows how ahead of the curve, Ceylon, as it was then known was in-terms of grooming and teaching people basic skills. For instance, most of the senior doctors in Singapore were Ceylonese who went across, including people in the judicial sector. The current Finance Minister of Singapore is Tharman Shanmugaratnam and his father was a Sri Lankan from Jaffna who went across and is still a member of the Medical Faculty in the Singapore University. So we have a head start in-terms of human capital. All our people as you know, have a hunger for education, whether you go to the village or the richest families in the cities, all of them have that great hunger for education. To me that is our strength. We have better human capital resources I would wager, on a per capita basis even than India and other countries in the region. So we can provide that real leading edge. Our people are all over the world. Wherever you go, if you look at expatriates, Sri Lankans in any country, anywhere in the world – I have been to the Caribbean, places like Barbados, even there you find Sri Lankans. And they are doing very well in their professional endeavours. So we have to reach out to this diaspora, as I call it, and ensure that they also come and help us but already within the country, we have a sufficient pool of people who really can lead the charge, not just in-terms of raising Sri Lanka’s profile but also attracting foreign investment and other resources which will help this country provide leadership in this region in the decades ahead. So remember that it is a great challenge for all of us, this institution is going to be at the epicenter of this country’s efforts to develop itself. President Maithripala Sirisena who visited us, a few weeks ago, made it very clear that his main objective is to see that people’s incomes increase. That is his objective. He has spelt out his objective. How do we achieve that? That is where we have to sit now and brainstorm. To me the key challenge is how to raise productivity. Productivity is very important, output per capita. This is the key element that we have to utilize. We have to see how we can harness the use of Information Technology to leapfrog a lot of time that we have wasted in this useless war that ended five years ago and see that we really enable ourselves to make this economy grow, leapfrog into the 21st century, start using IT and other types of skills which will then make us a very modern economy and raise our productivity levels which have lagged in the last thirty to forty years. That I think is a key challenge we should focus on, and how to achieve that is really up to you. It is your ideas that will make this happen. So thank you very much once again, I wish you all the very best for the next 65 years, I don’t know how many of us will be there but I am sure some of those young people who have just joined the bank will certainly be there for a large measure of that time. And I think we have everything at our disposal now to achieve what I have set out. It is really up to you now to make that happen. So thank you very much and God bless you.

   DeLisle Worrell: The Barbados IBFS sector and the efficiency of international commerce Lecture by Dr DeLisle Worrell, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, at the Carleton University, Ottawa, 17 September 2015. *      *      * Small international business and financial services (IBFS) centres like Liechtenstein, Guernsey, the Caymans and Barbados – to take a random selection – have an enduring place in international commerce, because they serve to make the international system more efficient. Through the services that international companies locate in these centres, companies are able to offer products and services to the global market more cost effectively than they would otherwise be able to do. It is because of this economic reason that the foremost centres have proven so resilient, in the face of repeated waves of misrepresentation. The truth, as I will show in this presentation, is that international firms that use subsidiaries in IBFS centres to locate appropriate aspects of their global operations, are more competitive than those that do not. The sources of IBFS competitiveness vary by country, and include the expertise available in the centre, its global interconnectedness, the local penetration of information and communications technology (ICT), the quality of life available in the centre, the quality of infrastructure, and many others. Importantly, most centres will offer local expertise that is on par with London, New York and Singapore, at significantly lower costs than would be the case for the large global financial centres. In this essay we cite evidence of Barbados’ competitive standing in international financial markets. How IBFS centres contribute to global efficiency The main factors which make international firms that use well regulated, well networked IBFS centres more efficient than the competition include: • Such centres may reduce market frictions and information costs to the international firms whose subsidiaries they host; • They are able to offer internationally comparable skills at lower wages and other costs; and • They offer a corporate tax regime which provides for lower taxes on value added in the export of goods and services. Because of these factors the IBFS centre is able to offer benefits to producers and consumers of IBFS goods and services, while at the same time providing an economic benefit to the host country. The investing company is able to produce the services located in the IBFS centre for sale in third countries at significantly lower cost, with no sacrifice in quality. The third country receiving the finance, product and/or service is able to access the output at a more attractive price. The benefit to the IBFS centre is the wages, fees, taxes and other value added in the centre. There are only a handful of studies which have attempted empirical verification of the extent of efficiency gains due to the use of IBFS centres. Naitram (2014) quantifies the impact of 17 small centres, using data from the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey. His findings were that small IBFS centres that offer a wide range of services transmit finance efficiently from investors to productive end users, largely by reducing market frictions. A study by Hejazi (2015) speaks to efficiency gains for Canadian companies from using IBFS centres as conduits to the global economy. He draws inferences from the complementarity between Canadian outward investment, since Canada became a net exporter of FDI in the BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   mid-1990s, and the growth of Canadian exports. He finds that the complementarity between FDI and exports is stronger when the Barbados IBFS centre is used as a conduit for investment abroad than it is otherwise. The study by Worrell and Lowe (2013) reports that Caribbean IBFS centres benefit their economies through their contributions to GDP, government revenues and employment. The sector is especially important as a source of tertiary level jobs in a labour force with levels of educational achievement that are superior to most emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Barbados’ competitive strengths Each year the World Economic Forum issues a Global Competitiveness Report on the overall score of almost 150 countries, including Barbados. In the 2014–15 report Barbados’ competitive strengths included: • Health services: life expectancy is high, and there are no major communicable diseases present; • Education is of high quality, enrolment is high and most teachers are trained; • There is a good infrastructure of roads, port, airport, and the reliability and coverage of electricity is high; • The relatively high use of the internet, and the availability of the latest technologies; • The low level of organised crime, judicial independence, the legal framework, the reliability of Police services, the ethical behaviour of firms, the strength of auditing and reporting systems; • The soundness of banks and the quality of financial regulation; • In the labour market, the capacity to attract talent, the high proportion of women in the workforce, and cooperation in labour-employee relationships; • The intensity of local competition, the quality of local suppliers; and • The number of patents relative to the size of the country, and partnerships between UWI and industry. Barbados has additional competitive strengths, beyond those mentioned in the Global Competitiveness Report. Important for attracting investment is the fact that English is the native language. Barbados’ cultural and historical ties with North America have undoubtedly been a factor in making that region the main source of investment in the Barbadian IBFS sector. The Barbadian climate is excellent and the society offers cultural variety and convenience that makes for a high quality of life. An important source of competitiveness for Barbados is the fact that the country maintains a sound, comprehensive and up-to-date regulatory framework for all IBFS activity. Joint teams from the World Bank and IMF confirmed the soundness of overall regulation in the most recent Financial System Stability Assessment (2013). Peer reviews are underway for Barbados under the Global Forum for the exchange of tax information, and under the aegis of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force on money laundering. This regulatory framework is a competitive strength for Barbados, in an international market where it has become vital for companies and financial institutions to protect their good name. Barbados is proactive in international fora, including the Steering Group of the Global Forum, the Regional Consultative Group for the Americas of the Financial Stability Board and the Working Group on Financial Issues of the CFATF. Another competitive aspect in which Barbados has an edge is the country’s large and growing network of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) and Bilateral Investment Treaties 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   (BITs). The list of countries with whom Barbados has DTAs and BITs is given in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1: Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) Double Taxation Agreements in Force DTAs Awaiting Ratification • Austria, 2007 • Bahrain, 2013 • Botswana, 2005; protocol, 2015 • Canada, 1980; protocol, 2013 • Caricom, 1995 • China, 2000; protocol, 2010 • Cuba, 2000 • Czech Republic, 2012 • Finland, 1989; protocol 2012 • Iceland, 2012 • Luxembourg, 2011 • Malta, 2002; protocol, 2014 • Mauritius, 2005 • Netherlands, 2007 • Norway, 1990; protocol, 2012 • Panama, 2011 • Qatar, 2013 • San Marino, 2013 • Singapore, 2014 • Spain, 2011 • Sweden, 1991; protocol, 2012 • Switzerland, 1963 • UK, revised 2012 • USA, 1984; protocols 1991, 2004 • Venezuela, 2001  • Ghana • Italy • Portugal • Rwanda • UAE    BIS central bankers’ speeches 3

First there are international business companies (IBCs) involved in a wide range of commercial and funding activities, which are exempt from capital controls. These companies are not permitted to offer services to Barbadian residents. Financial institutions which fall into this category receive a separate license, which requires them to be supervised either by the Central Bank of Barbados or the Barbados Financial Services Authority, in accordance with the relevant international supervisory norms. Some firms find it preferable to register as domestic companies, even though they offer services only to non-residents. In such cases the company may benefit from a preferential domestic corporation tax, which offers rebates based on the percentage of exports in the firm’s output. The firm then may qualify for exemption of revenues earned in Barbados under an appropriate DTA. The fourth element in the legal framework is a special “carve out” from the Barbados DTA for Canadian insurance companies which qualify. These so-called exempt insurance companies gain relief under guidelines specific to the activity. The future Barbados is a competitive, high quality provider of IBFSs. International companies are able to increase their competitive offerings on the global market by judicious use of Barbados’ IBFS centre. The economic logic that is driven by competitive forces is what drives expectations of continuing growth of IBFS services in Barbados and elsewhere.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Fernando Restoy: The Banking Union – achievements and challenges Speech by Mr Fernando Restoy, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain, at the closure of the presentation of the third report on the Banking Union “La Unión Bancaria: suma y sigue”, organised by Centro de Sector Financiero PwC and IE Business School, Madrid, 2 December 2015. *      *      * 1. Introduction Let me begin by thanking the organisers, both PWC and the Instituto de Empresa, for their kind invitation to participate in the closure of this presentation of the third report on the Banking Union. We can hardly overstate the importance of the Banking Union for the European construction project and, in particular, for ensuring the sound working of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). A true monetary union among sovereign States is not confined to the use of the same banknotes and coins in each country, nor to the denomination of trade transactions with the same metric. Monetary union requires the conditions in which liquidity is exchanged to be homogeneous across the entire area. Insofar as these exchanges are typically intermediated by financial institutions, by means of whose liabilities trade and financial transactions are settled, the appropriate flow of liquidity within a monetary union demands that the risk associated with these liabilities should not depend on the location of the institution issuing them. Naturally, to achieve this homogeneity, bank crisis-prevention and management mechanisms are needed along with risk-mutualisation arrangements that minimise the link between national economic and fiscal conditions and the ability to preserve the value of bank liabilities in each jurisdiction. These requirements include a single supervisory mechanism as a prevention tool, a single resolution mechanism that pursues the homogenous treatment of banks with viability problems and has a common fund to make this economically feasible, and an integrated deposit guarantee scheme that ensures identical coverage throughout the monetary area for eligible deposit-holders. We can already claim that the project to set up a Banking Union that includes the above-mentioned ingredients is close to becoming a tangible reality. Just a few weeks back we celebrated the first anniversary of the start-up of the first of the three pillars of the Banking Union project, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM); the Single Resolution Mechanism, the second pillar of the Banking Union, is now under way and will be fully operational from 1 January 2016. Admittedly, certain relevant aspects have still to be set in train. First, the single resolution fund must be strengthened to ensure that it is strong enough to withstand future banking crises, without destabilising the public finances of the countries concerned. Further, we must step up efforts to move forward on the third pillar of the Banking Union, the establishment of a common deposit guarantee scheme, based on the proposal released by the European Commission last week. I would like to focus today on the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the most developed component of the Banking Union. In this connection, I shall review the milestones reached and address what I consider are the main challenges ahead for us. 2. SSM milestones The first SSM milestone took place precisely before it assumed full supervisory responsibility, and it entailed successfully conducting the “comprehensive assessment” of all significant euro area banking groups. This review helped to enhance the information on the situation of 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  European banks and to identify the measures that could be necessary to strengthen their solvency. In this respect, it should be recalled that Spanish banks were those that evidenced fewest incidents in the asset quality review process, which entailed adjustments of little more than 0.1% of its risk-weighted assets. This outcome, along with the limited impact of the stress tests, highlighted the fact that the reform of the Spanish banking system undertaken in previous years had met its objectives. At present, we are working on the stress test scheduled for the coming year. This test, following the methodology of the European Banking Authority, will be made on a sample of banks – six of which Spanish – covering 70% of euro area banking assets. The results will be published at the start of the third quarter of 2016. One of the main challenges of the SSM at the outset was to make its complex governance structure workable. This complexity derives from the institutional restrictions imposed by the Treaty, from the need to ensure the separation of the monetary policy and prudential supervision functions attributed to the ECB, and from the objective of achieving a suitable incorporation of the national authorities into the new framework without impinging on the ECB’s leadership in supervisory decisions. As you know, the central SSM body is the Supervisory Board, which is responsible for the planning and implementation of oversight tasks and for submitting decision-making proposals to the Governing Council, which the latter may approve or object to, but not amend. The Board is made up of 25 members: the Chair, Vice-Chair, four members appointed by the ECB Governing Council and the representatives of the national supervisory authorities of the 19 participating Member States. The Supervisory Board is intensely involved in all the SSM’s key actions, as a result of the competencies directly attributed to it under the prevailing European Regulation and the absence of extensive delegation powers. Indeed, in its first year alone, the Supervisory Board has adopted around 1,200 decision proposals. This heavy workload, far greater than is habitually the case for the maximum decision-making bodies of supervisory agencies in other jurisdictions, is an operational challenge of the highest order that the Board is so far responding to with considerable effectiveness, maintaining a high frequency of face-to-face meetings complemented by numerous teleconferences and written procedures. More generally, the start-up of the SSM has necessitated major changes in the internal structure of both the ECB and the national authorities. In the case of the ECB, four new directorates general for microprudential supervision have been created, and the staff has been increased to assign to this new function more than 1,000 employees. At the same time, the national authorities have made a great effort to adapt to this new framework. In our case at the Banco de España, the Directorate General Banking Supervision was restructured and its departments reorganised to create a structure mirroring that adopted by the ECB, so as to provide for smoother interaction between both institutions. However, the most significant change has been the creation of the joint supervisory teams, made up of employees from the ECB and from the national authorities. These teams are the basis for the day-to-day supervision of each significant bank. They are coordinated by an ECB member of staff, who is assisted by one or several sub-coordinators from the national authorities, on whom the coordinator draws support for the organisation of the work and the management of the local teams. This admittedly novel design is in response to the need to combine a centralised management framework while harnessing the knowledge and proximity to banks that national supervisors provide. It should be stressed here that more than two-thirds of the members of these teams are from the national supervisors. The staff from these authorities are also generally entrusted with leading on-site inspections within their jurisdiction. Moreover, as you know, the national 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  supervisory agencies keep functions relating to the direct surveillance of the so-considered less significant banks. This all explains why the start-up of the SSM has meant no saving in supervisory resources at the national level. On the contrary, the national authorities have had to address the considerable challenge posed by the loss of human resources to the ECB. In our case, thanks to the success of Banco de España candidates in selection processes, approximately one-quarter of our supervisory staff have moved to work for the ECB, including three senior managers who today occupy high-responsibility posts – one Director General and two Deputy Directors General – in this institution. The third milestone has been the setting in place of an operational framework for the pursuit of the supervisory functions of the SSM. In this connection, work has been performed since the outset of the project to define common frameworks for action enabling the different practices pursued by different national authorities, with their greatly differing supervisory cultures, to be overcome. This work saw a Supervisory Manual devised in which processes and the operational methodology are described. Naturally, certain key aspects of supervisory procedures have still to be smoothed. In fact, the Manual should be seen as an evolving document, the regular update of which on the basis of experience accumulated is needed to complete convergence towards better supervisory practices. Likewise, to achieve greater consistency in the regulatory framework, it has also been necessary to review the national application of the various options permitted under European regulations. European solvency regulations – namely the Directive and Regulation on capital requirements – confer some degree of discretion upon Member States and national supervisors in the implementation of specific regulatory aspects. Such aspects include the timetable for the progressive adoption of new solvency standards and the granting of exceptions in respect of compliance with certain prudential requirements. This degree of national flexibility had to be accepted at the time by European legislators in the complex Directive and Regulation negotiations. Naturally, the fact such a diversity of rules are in place hampers supervisory action and prevents the homogenous treatment of banks based on their objective position. Accordingly, in recent months, the SSM Supervisory Board has worked intensely in this field. Their efforts have seen a preliminary agreement allowing a common approach to be adopted in relation to the application of these “national options and discretions” in the hands of the supervisory authorities. The terms of this agreement are now being subjected to public consultation, a process which will finalise on 16 December. I trust that this agreement, once it is finally approved by the ECB, may be implemented in the opening months of 2016 and that, in any event, future revisions of European legislation will envisage less room for discretion on the part of the Member States, so that the singleness of the relevant legal framework for banking activity throughout the EU may become firmly anchored. To wrap up this first part of my speech, allow me to highlight certain relevant decisions taken by the Supervisory Board during this first year. Among the most important are those relating to the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), which has for the first time been carried out with a common methodology for all SSM banks. This process, which includes both quantitative and qualitative aspects, determines the risk profile of each significant institution, the sufficiency of its liquidity and solvency in terms of this profile and, finally, it sets the minimum capital levels to be maintained. The decisions on capital, the adoption of which for 2016 will be shortly formalised, will, for all the SSM’s significant institutions, entail average capital requirements somewhat higher than those of the previous year: around 30 basis points (bp), rising to 50 bp if the impact of the phasing-in of the capital buffers envisaged in European legislation is taken into account. 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  As you will recall, in January this year a recommendation on dividend distribution policy was adopted in which banks were urged to keep conservative dividend distribution arrangements so as to preserve their solvency. This recommendation will be shortly reassessed. In turn, common criteria have been laid down for recurring decisions such as authorisations for the acquisition of qualifying holdings in credit institutions, assessment of fitness and properness of board members, or the requirements to be made in capital reductions and issuances. Finally, I must highlight the relevant role played by the SSM in the management of the Greek crisis. The SSM not only monitored the situation of the banks continuously, but, once agreement was reached between the European and Greek authorities last summer, it was entrusted with determining the recapitalisation requirements of Greece’s four significant institutions on the basis of a specific comprehensive assessment exercise, whose results were recently published. In the coming months, the SSM must ensure that the recapitalisation of these banks goes ahead as stipulated. 3. Some challenges That said, and as I stated at the outset, the SSM has numerous challenges to face in the near future. I would like to mention four in particular. Firstly, the microprudential policy stance sought must be clearly defined. The SSM, despite its exemplary start-up, is still under construction and its criteria, practices and specific objectives have not yet reached the degree of stability desirable. Evidently, we must shorten the transition as far as possible, so that banks are aware with sufficient certainty of the supervisor’s requirements in the short and medium term and can, in this way, effectively design their strategic and management measures. True, this objective is currently hampered by the still-unstable international regulatory framework. I trust the Basel Committee’s announced intention in its recent report to the G20 to see through the regulatory reform next year will be fulfilled. In any event, in the supervisory realm we must make further efforts to specify with greater precision and permanence the solvency requirements for each bank based on its risk profile, and to establish certain clear guidelines on the application of restrictions on the remuneration of capital instruments and on directors’ variable remuneration. At the same time, as I previously pointed out, we must continue to work on the convergence of supervisory practices, moving towards better standards, and on smoothing the differences that still persist across the different SSM jurisdictions. For example, while some national authorities have traditionally focused on reviewing management procedures, others have placed particular emphasis on reviewing the classification and valuation of assets on financial statements. These differences in supervisory practices involve, in turn, heterogeneity in the professional profile of the employees of the various authorities now sharing missions within the SSM. Against this background, the Banco de España has a tradition – one that I think it is comprehensively successful – of conferring high importance in its supervisory work to monitoring the rigour of financial information and of the models used to calculate risk-weighted assets. Naturally, it is our wish that these elements, which crucially affect the supervisor’s capacity to properly measure banks’ solvency situation, should be part of the common model adopted by the SSM and applied uniformly to all banks. A third significant challenge concerns achieving a fruitful framework of interaction between the SSM and the Single Resolution Mechanism. The regulations have set in place a complex structure in Europe, which includes the creation of a resolution agency (the Single Resolution Board) separated institutionally from the supervisor. This agency has been granted wide-ranging powers both in respect of the definition of resolvability requirements – which include the determination of a minimum volume of instruments capable of absorbing losses – and of 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  the activation of resolution procedures for non-viable banks, as well as the selection of the most suitable tools to implement them. Resolution actions have direct consequences for financial stability, which is a public good that the SSM seeks to protect, and they turn on the more vulnerable banks, which are precisely those that require greater attention from the prudential supervisor. Accordingly, the defining of effective information and analysis co-operation and exchange procedures between the Supervisory and Resolution Boards is crucial for preventing dysfunctions, overlaps and frictions that hamper the proper functioning of the Banking Union. A Memorandum of Understanding between both agencies is currently being drawn up and will, I hope, contribute to achieving the necessary coordination. Lastly, we should sustain our efforts in order to achieve the degree of cohesion between the various components of the SSM that effective supervision requires. The SSM directly supervises 122 European banking groups, encompassing some 1,200 institutions. This is done with supervisory teams that draw on staff from various institutions, with highly diverse skill sets, seniority, experience and working conditions. Evidently, we must strive to fully develop a sense of mission to which all the component parts must contribute, under the leadership of the ECB and its Supervisory Board, without exclusions or unnecessary subordination. That is vital for maintaining the motivation and commitment of all SSM supervisory staff, irrespective of the authority to which they are attached. Indeed, they have to date shown exceptional professionalism. Final remarks In concluding, I will say that the past year has seen major headway in setting the Banking Union in place, but we still have some way to go. We must move ahead in a setting that will be complex for the European banking industry. Specifically, economic activity remains relatively sluggish, price stability is subject to significant risks and, as a result of this, interest rates are holding at very low levels. Against this background, banking business is feeling the effects of the difficulties in reactivating credit, of modest net interest income and of the impaired assets still on their balance sheets. And compounding this are growing regulatory demands which, though they should be conducive to the industry’s stability in the medium term, are raising the pressure in the short term on profitability. It is essential in this setting for managers and supervisors to revise the soundness of banks’ business model and, in particular, their capacity to generate resources in a stable manner that will ensure satisfactory levels of profitability and solvency in the medium term. That may require a correction of the European banking industry’s excess capacity apparently prevailing at present. It is important that the authorities involved should attempt to facilitate the process – which should in any event be led by banks themselves – so that the correction comes about in the most orderly fashion possible. Thank you very much. 
   Ignazio Visco: The Bank of Italy’s analysis of household finances Concluding remarks by Mr Ignazio Visco, Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the conference “The Bank of Italy’s Analysis of Household Finances – Fifty years of The Survey on Household Income and Wealth and the Financial Accounts”, Rome, 4 December 2015. *      *      * Andrea Brandolini contributed widely to these remarks with perceptive suggestions and insights. It is a great pleasure to close this conference celebrating 50 years of the Bank of Italy’s Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) – and 51 of Financial Accounts. Over half a century, both the micro-data of the former and the aggregate estimates of the latter have provided essential information for the economic and statistical analyses carried out at the Bank of Italy, informing and influencing its policy-making process. There is also a personal note, however. Throughout my long professional life at the Bank, I often relied on these data. I hope that you will forgive me if, in these concluding remarks, I shall indulge in some personal memories. Prologue: the survey forerunners Household budgets have long attracted the attention of social scientists. Since the mid-19th century many researchers have gathered detailed information on expenses and revenues of individual households. These budget data stimulated studies on the consumption behaviour of families of farmers, manual workers and clerks, and contributed to the detection of empirical regularities such as Engel’s law. Italian economists and statisticians played a crucial role in formalising these results. In his classical article on “The Early History of Empirical Studies of Consumer Behavior”, George Stigler refers to Rodolfo Benini and Corrado Gini as the authors of the first modern statistical demand studies, and to Gustavo Del Vecchio as the first to estimate, in 1912, a (food) consumption function. Using budget data for a number of countries, Del Vecchio calculated an income elasticity comprised between 0.4 and 0.8, with an average of about 0.6.1 The paper presented to this conference by Neri, Rondinelli and Scoccianti implies an income elasticity of about 0.66, although for total expenditure rather than for food alone.2 A surprising regularity, a century later! However useful to study consumer behaviour, individual budgets cannot tell us much about the distribution of income or expenditure. In June 1947, the Italian Minister of the Budget Luigi Einaudi – who was still formally the Governor of the Bank of Italy, before being later elected President of the Italian Republic – advocated at a meeting of the Constituent Assembly the need to produce a report on “the standard of living of Italian citizens, their incomes, the social categories into which they are divided”. Thereafter, Einaudi, Del Vecchio, then serving as the Treasury Minister, and Giuseppe Pella, the Finance Minister, commissioned a sample survey on household incomes with the purpose of providing a sound basis for economic policies. The survey was conducted by Istituto Doxa, a private agency for 1 G.J. Stigler, “The Early History of Empirical Studies of Consumer Behavior”, Journal of Political Economy 62, 1954, 95–113; G. Del Vecchio, “Relazioni fra entrata e consumo”, Giornale degli economisti 54 (n.s.), 1912, 111–142, 228–254, 389–439. Del Vecchio did not use Italian data, because individual budgets were relatively scarcer for Italy than for France or Germany. However, Giovanni Vecchi has recently dug out as many as 11,500 individual budgets for the period 1855–1911, plus another 9,500 for the years until 1965. See S. Chianese e G. Vecchi, “Bilanci di famiglia”, in G. Vecchi, In ricchezza e in povertà. Il benessere degli italiani dall’Unità a oggi, Bologna, Il Mulino, 2011, 355–389. 2 A. Neri, C. Rondinelli and F.

   the analysis of public opinion founded and directed by Pierpaolo Luzzatto Fegiz.3 It cost 16 million lire, approximately 400,000 euros at today’s prices. A second (smaller) survey was conducted and published by Doxa in 1951. By digging through the Bank of Italy’s archives, it was recently found out that this survey was not only eventually paid for in full by the Bank, but was also designed with the help of economists in its Research Department. Its Director, and the Bank’s Governor 25 years later, Paolo Baffi, set in a letter to Luzzatto Fegiz that the main purpose of the survey was “ascertaining the prevalent opinions on the allocation of a given income rise… between consumption and saving, after distinguishing the former into current expenses and durable goods and the latter into direct investment (real estates and businesses), financial assets and other savings”.4 For some unknown reason the Bank’s primary role in this survey was not publicised, but it testifies to the involvement of the Bank of Italy in the first attempts to measure the income and the consumption behaviour of Italian households. This involvement is remarkable as it reveals the early support of the Bank for the use of representative probability sampling. Official sample surveys were still in their infancy: they had become accepted by statistical agencies in the United States only in the 1940s with the start of the Current Population Survey.5 The Bank’s position is even more significant when seen against the background of an environment which was not necessarily favourable to this statistical tool.6 The readiness to engage in these new statistical techniques is an example of the Bank’s attitude towards paying attention to and taking advantage of developments at the frontier of research. The Survey has continued to be a source of innovation. This has happened, for instance, as regards the dissemination of its results: first, in the 1980s, with the release of anonymised micro-data to academic researchers; then, with the participation since the 1990s in the Luxembourg Income Study, an international cooperative project for the assembly and standardisation of income data at a household level. The integration of use and production of statistical data The Bank’s involvement in the (second) Doxa survey is also noteworthy since it shows that the statistical collection was conceived as closely connected with the needs of economic analysis from the outset. This is not to be taken for granted. Still in 1985, Zvi Griliches observed that “while economists have increased their use of surveys in recent years and have even begun designing and commissioning special purpose surveys of their own, in general, the data collection and thus the responsibility for the quality of the collected material is still largely delegated to census bureaus, survey research centers, and similar institutions, and is divorced from the direct supervision and responsibility of the analyzing team”.7 The history of the Bank of Italy’s SHIW is not one of “divorce” between producers and users but 3 The citation from Einaudi’s speech and the subsequent information are drawn from P.

On the usefulness, but also on several limitations attributed to the use of the “representative method”, an influential opinion was that expressed by Corrado Gini in an article co-authored with Luigi Galvani.

   rather of intense, if at times thorny, dialogue. In the early 1990s, I remember Governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi’s reluctance to accept my proposal to create a Statistical Division within the Research Department on the grounds that the Bank’s economists were those who knew best which statistics were needed, and therefore were also best suited, as potential users, to being involved in their production. A good example of the need for dialogue between data producers and economic analysts is credit rationing. In order to estimate the extent to which households have no access to credit, we require a complex set of interrelated questions, first asking respondents whether they had thought about applying for a loan, then whether they actually made the application, and finally whether they got it. Credit-rationed borrowers are the households which were denied a loan, or not granted the entire amount requested. On the basis of a long time series that starts in 1989, credit conditions are confirmed to have eased in Italy in 2014 from the peak reached in 2012, although we are not yet back to the pre-crisis situation. The rich formulation of the questionnaire also allows for the monitoring of a broader concept of borrowing constraints, which considers what we once called in an article on borrowing constraints “discouraged borrowers”, that is the households which refrain from asking for a loan because they anticipate that their application will be turned down.8 Likewise, the assessment of financial vulnerability and over-indebtedness relies on detailed information and analysis that combine data on income, debt service payments and liabilities. This is shown by the papers by D’Alessio and Iezzi, and Bartiloro, Michelangeli and Rampazzi discussed in this conference,9 as well as by the regular use of the SHIW data in the regular analysis of macroeconomic developments and financial stability.10 The anticipations of economic agents, whether consumers or businessmen, play a central role in the decisions they make, but their measurement is far from straightforward.11 Unsurprisingly, household expectations have been a recurrent topic in the Survey. As shown by Alfonso Rosolia, households were asked already in the first Surveys in the mid-1960s whether they anticipated an income increase or reduction a year ahead, and how they would allocate any income gain between saving and various consumption items. The eagerness of the Bank’s researchers turned this question into a far more sophisticated exercise in the Survey for 1989, when respondents were confronted with a full probabilistic format about the prospects of their labour or pension earnings in the next year that has now become, in a simplified formulation, part of the core section of the questionnaire. The attention to household expectations is important to shed light on consumer behaviour. For instance, in the early 1990s it was used to quantify the impact of subjective earnings uncertainty on precautionary saving.12 The paper presented by Olympia Bover finds that the subjective expectations on house prices matter for predicting the spending behaviour of 8 L.

   Spanish households.13 Yet we should not overlook the difficulties that respondents face in answering probabilistic questions. In the Survey for 1989, 57 per cent of households anticipated a rise in income, by 6.5 per cent on average, but as many as one out of five households did not answer. In the last wave of the Survey the proportion of households which failed to provide an answer fell to below 5 per cent, but the overwhelming majority, 83 per cent, predicted no income change one year ahead. This might be reasonable given the recent income dynamics, but may also signal their difficulty to account for uncertain outcomes. There is a need for further research, but experimenting on measuring expectations is a worthy exercise. It has undoubtedly enhanced the Survey’s reputation. Indeed, Charles Manski included it among the few “major platforms for methodological exploration and substantive research” on the use of probabilistic formats to elicit expectations.14 Manski also mentioned only one survey of firms using probabilistic questioning to elicit business expectations: the Italian Survey of Investment in Manufacturing. This has also been carried out by the Bank of Italy since the mid-1980s and is a good example of cross-fertilisation among different research areas. Micro-data as a necessary complement to macro-data Eliciting expectations or measuring complex economic concepts is not the only accomplishment of the SHIW. Its main contribution has been to allow us to account for the heterogeneity of household characteristics and behaviour in the analysis of the Italian economy. When it started in the mid-1960s, the Bank of Italy’s Survey provided virtually the first detailed information on the budgets of Italian households since the Doxa survey of 1948. Its information proved extremely valuable. Drawing again from my own personal experience, I remember using the Survey data in the mid-1970s to calculate the dispersion of earnings among income earners, and its decomposition into the within- and between-sector components, possibly one of the first “official” applications of the exact inequality decomposition proposed by Henry Theil.15 For a few years, these calculations were published in the chapter on the labour market of the Bank’s Annual Report, integrating the aggregate information on productivity and wage dynamics, and the SHIW main results are still regularly published in the Annual Report. The availability of a relatively long span of estimates on the distributions of earnings, income and, for a shorter period, wealth in Italy has allowed for the documentation of the decline of income inequality among Italian households until the mid-1980s and its subsequent increase. The extent of the rise in the last decades is smaller than that observed in many other advanced countries – the United States and the United Kingdom mostly in the 1980s, Sweden and Finland in the 1990s – but the level of income concentration in Italy is still relatively high when compared at an international level.16 These inequality series have been widely used by external researchers, and are included in many international compilations 13 O.

   used for research in social sciences, assembled at the World Bank, the UNU-WIDER, the OECD or by academic researchers.17 My first approach to the Survey had occurred even earlier, when Francesco Frasca, Ezio Tarantelli, Carlo Tresoldi and I used its data for 1971–73 to provide additional microeconomic evidence on the consumption function.18 As we had no access to micro-data at the time, our assessment was based on comparing cell mean values from cross tabulations of the kind shown in this conference by Alfonso Rosolia. Yet these “granular” data were crucial to study, however crudely, demographic and life-cycle effects, something which was not possible with the aggregate time series. In particular, we could not find, for Italy, the dissaving at old ages observed for other countries, and attributed this result to the system of social security and the family structure prevailing in the country. The Survey’s micro-data have later become a precious source to investigate consumption and saving. An important example of this strand of research is the volume Saving and the Accumulation of Wealth. Essays on Italian Household and Government Saving Behavior, edited in 1994 with Albert Ando and Luigi Guiso from a conference held in January 1992. It includes contributions from quite a few participants in this conference. Reconciling micro and macro During its long life, the SHIW has undergone several changes aimed at improving its quality. Some of them have created discontinuities, which have to be taken carefully into consideration when using results from different waves to construct time series. In order to overcome some of the definition problems, the historical archive now allows researchers to access micro-data from different waves in a common format. Today’s celebration has provided the opportunity to release an entirely revised historical archive as well as to upload selected time series on the Bank’s website. A major overhaul of the Survey took place in 1986–87, following a conference held in Perugia in February 1985. Albert Ando, a close personal friend of many of us and for many years an invaluable consultant of the Bank, played a crucial role in that restructuring. Albert made two important points. First, he argued that it was necessary to increase the size of the sample, possibly reducing its frequency to offset the cost increase, in order to capture the behaviour of small demographic groups (he had in mind distinguishing an old person living alone from an old person living with a younger person). Second, he stressed the inability of the Survey to measure financial assets and liabilities, implicitly suggesting that some serious effort was necessary to cover these variables satisfactorily – although he admitted to having no special insight into how to do so, because this inability appeared to be a “peculiarly Italian problem”.19 Both Albert’s suggestions were implemented: the sample size was doubled to around 8,000 units in 1986, and since 1987 the Survey has been carried out every two years and contains detailed questions on all wealth holdings. Information has considerably improved, 17 See Deininger and Squire’s Measuring Income Inequality Database (http://go.worldbank.org/UVPO9KSJJ0), Milanovic’s All the Ginis Dataset (http://go.worldbank.org/9VCQW66LA0), the World Income Inequality Database (https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-world-income-inequality-database), the Social and Welfare Statistics Database (http://stats.oecd.org/BrandedView.aspx?oecd_bv_id=socwel-data-en&doi=data-00654-en), Atkinson and Morelli’s Chartbook of Economic Inequality (http://www.chartbookofeconomicine quality.com/). 18 F.

   but not all measurement problems have been sorted out, as observed by Gambacorta and Neri.20 In particular, as is well known, the measurement of financial assets still fall short of the corresponding aggregate in the financial accounts: a serious problem of consistency between micro and macro evidence.21 The financial accounts are also one of the Bank’s statistical products. After the Second World War, Paolo Baffi strongly encouraged the collection of aggregate statistics on assets and liabilities of the institutional sectors, and in 1949 the Bank’s Annual Report published a table of flows, called the “national monetary balance sheet”, broken down into public and private sectors. This accounting scheme was the embryo of the financial accounts that first appeared in the Annual Report for 1964, thanks to the work of Franco Cotula and others.22 Financial accounts have been published regularly by the Bank ever since. The completion of financial accounts was an important accomplishment, but it still fell short of producing a fully integrated set of sectoral balance sheets. Over time, the Bank has frequently engaged in the estimation of the value of real assets, with a particular focus on households. I contributed to this effort in a paper with Carlo Tresoldi, where we used the Survey data to compute the value of dwellings.23 This exercise was occasionally repeated, for instance in an Appendix to the volume Saving and the Accumulation of Wealth prepared by Pino Marotta, Patrizia Pagliano and Nicola Rossi,24 until 2007 when the Bank first published the Supplement to the Statistical Bulletin on “Household Wealth in Italy”. With the recent publication by Istat, the Italian statistical office, of the stock of non-financial assets by institutional sector, we are now in a position to estimate for the first time the full balance sheets for the Italian economy. Producing Italy’s integrated wealth accounts is a challenge that Istat and the Bank cannot avoid facing. It is not the only one. I already mentioned the consistency issues for the micro and macro evidence for wealth, but similar problems arise for income. Moreover, flows and stocks need to be reconciled, both at the micro and macro level. Extending the scope of the data we collect definitely enriches our information set, but also calls for a much greater effort to reconcile the indications that diverse sources may provide. Not only flows: the importance of household wealth This long-standing concern for household wealth does not stem from mere academic curiosity. At the opening of the final conference of the Luxembourg Wealth Study held here in Rome in July 2007 at a time when we had not yet any hint of the incoming global financial crisis,25 I observed that “I still have the definite impression that in the last fifteen years there has been a substantial rise in wealth-to-income ratios in the developed countries. This has been especially the case for housing wealth. According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, 20 R. Gambacorta and A.

   the ratio of real assets to household disposable income in the United States rose from 3.7 in 1992 to 4.8 in 2004; in Italy, according to the SHIW, from 5.3 in 1993 to 6.4 in 2004. This is clearly a pattern shared by many other countries. On the other hand, net financial assets show a much more moderate trend. Overall, there seems to be little question that over this long period wealth has increased at higher rates, for many countries much higher rates, than household disposable income”. The work by Thomas Piketty has shown that these trends began even earlier, in the 1970s,26 although the global financial crises may have somewhat modified them. In the United States the ratio of real assets to household disposable income fell back to 4.2 in 2013, although in Italy it still stood at 6.6 in 2014. The increase in wealth may reflect the accumulation of personal savings or changes in asset values. But saving rates do not seem to show marked increases; if anything, in some countries they have been on a declining trend. So, much of the substantial rise in wealth-to-income ratios was due to asset prices. This raises several questions, that matter from analytical as well as policy perspectives. Why have we been observing such a long-term trend in asset prices? What is it that made for such a significant change in the prices of real, and perhaps to a lesser extent, financial assets relative to consumer goods and services? The financialisation of economies, the growing role of stock exchanges, the privatisation of State-owned firms, the expansion of household insurance technical reserves (due to the crisis of public pension schemes) can go some way towards explaining the rise in the ratio of financial wealth to GDP.27 In particular, there may be merit in considering the changes in shelter costs for owner-occupied housing as part of general consumer price changes. In this case, one should conclude that the prices of housing services went up substantially compared to other consumer goods and services. Yet, in part housing expenditure is clearly of a capital-good nature. One should also conclude that house owners were able to extract substantial rent from their accumulated real estate.28 As I observed in the July 2007 conference of the Luxembourg Wealth Study, “in the first case we have an issue of relevance for monetary stability, in the second for financial stability, especially as house prices have been moving faster in relatively short periods of time and the larger house values have been used as collateral in financial deals”. Conclusions: lessons from the past and challenges for the future These remarks on the Bank of Italy’s SHIW and the financial accounts are drawn from my own memories, but I hope to have also illustrated some important lessons that we can all draw from the experience at the Bank. Let me briefly recapitulate them here: 1. Undertaking research means being receptive to innovation and to exploring new statistical and analytical techniques; 2. The production and use of statistical data must be seen as fully integrated activities; 3. Micro-data are a necessary complement to macro-data: they are both essential to forming a comprehensive view of the functioning of the economy for policy-making purposes; 26 T.

   4. The joint consideration of micro and macro evidence for the same phenomena, and of related stocks and flows, raises important issues of consistency, an old problem made more evident today by the richness of available statistics; indeed, the micro/macro and stocks/flows reconciliation are a challenge for all statistical bodies; 5. And, obviously, there is a need to pay attention to both stocks and flows. These observations hold for economic and statistical research at the Bank in general. They are evidence of the Bank of Italy’s long-standing effort to stimulate cross-fertilisation and dialogue among different research areas, avoiding what is sometimes called the “silos culture”. I believe that this attitude, which is not necessarily shared elsewhere, is very important and should be preserved. The scientific community is now wondering about the future of household surveys. Bruce Meyer, Wallace Mok and James Sullivan have recently noted that “large and nationally representative surveys are arguably among the most important innovations in social science research of the last century”, but have extensively dealt with the problems plaguing household surveys and weakening their capacity to describe economic and social phenomena.29 There are new powerful statistical methods that can be used to improve them, such as the integration with administrative archives and web surveys to reach a more mobile and digital population. There are new rich and only partly explored sources of information, the “Big Data” residing on the internet. As has been mentioned by Federico Signorini in his opening remarks, Bank researchers are also exploring these new territories, confirming our attitude towards innovation. Yet, I think that the SHIW, possibly transformed, will be with us for many more years to come. To conclude, I wish to thank the many people who have made it possible for our Survey to reach its venerable age: the economists and the statisticians in the Bank of Italy, the interviewers and the staff of the agencies that have conducted the Survey in the field, the many academics and external users that have used it for their research and have helped us to improve it. Our deepest gratitude obviously goes to the 154,000 thousand households that have voluntarily accepted to be interrogated, some of them many times, on the difficult and confidential issues investigated by the Bank of Italy’s Survey.  29 B.D.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Evolving cyber threats – are we prepared? Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the Cybersecurity Summit for the Financial Services Industry, Manila, 24 November 2015. *      *      * Good morning everyone and welcome to this first Cybersecurity Summit for the Financial Services Industry. We at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas together with our Summit co-organizers BancNet and the Information Security Officers Group are pleased that you have joined us today to tackle the matter of cybercrimes. It is a fact: cybercrimes are being committed and financial institutions and financial consumers are being targeted. Questions are being asked: Is it widespread? Can we stop cybercrimes? How can we protect financial institutions and financial consumers from cybercrimes? Distinguished representatives from the financial services industry, technology partners, stakeholders in our financial sector, we need to address these issues together. Digital transformation in the financial services industry In this digital age, the transformative power of technology is evident in almost all aspects of human undertakings - from modern science, education, health care, financial markets, to personal interaction. Technology has likewise revolutionized banking and the manner it provides services and products. Financial customers can now perform banking transactions anytime, anywhere, at their convenience. We have also seen the adoption of technology by BSP supervised financial institutions or what we call BSFIs in offering innovative products and in the delivery of fast and efficient service at affordable prices. And through technology, financial institutions tap a new breed of costumers who expect top-of-the-line services, financial solutions and products with the flick of a finger. Based on our records as of December 2014, around 22 million users of electronic banking services and channels were being serviced by over one hundred banks across the country. Indeed, we have seen the volume and the value of transactions using e-money and e-banking channels grow steadily over the years. Clearly, technology innovation has become an integral part of the business that it is now considered a “must” for BSFIs to survive and thrive in the digital world. However, as in other fields, there is a downside that comes with innovations in technology - criminal elements have likewise evolved. While it is far from widespread, cybercrimes exploit advances in technology to expand, conceal and perpetrate their criminal activities from the real world to the cyber realm. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The cyber landscape Indeed, cybercrimes have spawned a global industry with skilled hackers-for-hire, terrorists and syndicates that target critical institutions, infrastructure or economies. The Philippines has not been spared from cybercrimes. Considered the social media capital of the world, the Philippines is on the radar screen of cyber criminals who try cyber attacks of varying complexities. Nevertheless, industry cooperation has enabled us to stop and capture cybercriminals. For instance, authorities have arrested foreign nationals associated with cyber syndicates who were involved in ATM skimming, credit card fraud, and phishing incidents. Can we stop cybercrimes? Well, studies indicate that cyber attacks and similar fraudulent activities against the financial services industry are likely to continue. But we can manage the risks related to cybercrimes. Ladies and gentlemen. Our proper response should be to broaden, deepen and escalate our own anti-cybercrime programs and activities together. The stakes are high: institutional and personal losses resulting from cybercrimes could undermine the public’s trust and confidence in financial institutions and ultimately our financial system. The right mindset So, what can we do to ensure industry-wide cyber security? How do we benefit from technology innovations while managing attendant risks and vulnerabilities? Well, according to a SEACEN paper , the right mindset and a holistic multi-stakeholder approach for managing cyber security must be adopted. At the Bangko Sentral, we have reduced these to three major themes that form the acronym PIN. As you know, PIN refers to the personal identification number that must be kept secure at all times by its owners, to prevent unauthorized access to their accounts. Allow me to share what PIN means to the BSP in terms of fighting cybercrime: P is to be proactive, not reactive; I is for information sharing and collaboration; and N is a constant reminder that cybercrime is NOT a technical issue. I will now briefly discuss each of these themes. P is to be “proactive, not reactive” Given a dynamic technology landscape, there is no room for complacency, one has to be proactive. While it may take years to develop a robust and effective security infrastructure, it may only take minutes or even seconds for cyber criminals to breach its defenses. And if criminals gain access to sensitive and critical information, they could trigger financial losses, business disruptions, damaged reputation, and even threaten the viability of the institution itself. This calls for a continuing cycle of rigorous assessments of the institution’s security versus emerging threats and risks. Cyber security controls, processes and procedures must be 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  continuously enhanced to mitigate weak points and achieve a higher state of resilience and maturity. This is the same rationale that underpins the Bangko Sentral’s policy to continuously enhance its supervisory framework through the issuance of guidelines, public advisories and memoranda, as well as the adoption of a robust and dynamic supervisory program. For instance BSP Circular No. 808 issued in August 2013 provides the framework for technology risk management which takes into account robust and multi-layered security controls for cyber-risk prevention, detection and response. The BSP has also introduced various initiatives and supervisory enhancements for a more proactive approach to cybersecurity supervision and oversight. These shall be discussed in detail later by BSP Deputy Governor Nestor A. Espenilla, Jr.  I is for “information sharing and collaboration” With the increasing sophistication and coordination of attacks, cyber security is no longer confined within the boundaries of each firm or organization; it is rightfully a shared concern by legitimate users of the cyber-environment. We believe information sharing and collaboration among various stakeholders is an effective, if not the best, antidote to the threat of cybercrimes. When attacks occur, early warning can spell the difference between business continuity and business catastrophe. While industry-wide collaboration efforts and initiatives are already in place - in coordination with industry associations, namely the Inter-Network Anti-Fraud Committee (IAFC) through the BancNet and ISOG– the ideal would be to expand it to include all stakeholders, such as technology service providers, law enforcement agencies, regulators and relevant government institutions. Ladies and gentlemen. In the fight against cybercrimes, let us remember to be inclusive, let us involve all stakeholders. In particular, financial consumers should be informed about cyber threats and how they can evade cyber attacks to protect their accounts. Indeed, cyber security is a shared responsibility, and each of us has a role to play in making our cyber landscape safer, more secure and resilient. N is for “not a technical issue” Ladies and gentlemen, cybersecurity is not achieved merely by deploying state-of-the-art security appliances and devices. In fact, a number of organizations with the most secure defenses have been subjected to cyber-attacks. More than a technical issue, cyber security should be a top priority concern by the Board and senior management. Cyber security initiatives and investments must be supported at the highest level of management to ensure their sustainability and adoption across all processes within organizations. As a wise man once said, it is the “tone at the top” that defines an institution’s cyber security culture. Given the crucial role that the Board and senior management play in creating a safe and sound cyber security regime, I am pleased to see that we have CEOs, members of the Board and senior management at this Summit. This speaks of executives walking the talk 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  on ensuring cyber security; this also reflects a high degree of cyber governance in the financial services industry. You all deserve a round of applause. Parting shots Ladies and gentlemen. We are fortunate to have with us at this summit, distinguished experts on dealing with cybercrimes. Also with us are industry players deeply involved in ensuring cyber security who will discuss current and emerging cyber threats confronting the financial services industry. Also up for discussion are international best practices on cyber security management. Let us therefore maximize the opportunities to be proactive, to inform and collaborate, and to remember that cybercrime is Not merely a technical issue. These are the lessons of PIN. Indeed, there are many cyber challenges ahead of us. With this summit, I hope we can put our collective wisdom and expertise together to collaborate and develop comprehensive and united solutions for a safe, secure and healthy cyber environment. Together, let us fight cybercrimes. Our ultimate goal is to propel our financial sector forward to an environment where robust financial institutions reach out to the unserved and the underserved to achieve financial inclusion that promotes inclusive growth. Maraming salamat. Mabuhay ang ating mahal na bansang Pilipinas! Mabuhay po tayong lahat!   
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Louis Kasekende: Modernising agriculture – a difficult challenge facing Uganda Remarks by Dr Louis Kasekende, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the Launch of the 2015 Agricultural Finance Yearbook, Kampala, 1 December 2015. *      *      * Hon Members of Parliament, The Executive Director, Economic Policy Research Centre, The Leadership team of the Uganda Agribusiness Alliance Representatives of GIZ and other development partners, Representatives of Ministries, Departments and Agencies of GOU, All distinguished participants, Good evening, Let me begin by commending everyone who worked on the 2015 Agricultural Finance Yearbook for their contributions to this project. Before we launch the Yearbook, I would like to comment on two of the issues addressed in it which I believe are especially pertinent for agricultural policy: first, the appropriate role of the budget and second, characteristics of the support needed by smallholder farmers. The modernisation of agriculture requires support from the Government budget for the supply of public goods and services needed by farmers. However, budgetary resources are scarce and hence it is essential that they are allocated only to areas of expenditure which can generate the highest social rates of return. As is demonstrated in chapter 1.4 of the Yearbook, on fiscal issues, the provision of tax exemptions for agriculture and agricultural lending, of various kinds, has delivered few, if any, tangible benefits for farmers in this country. Any benefits accruing from these tax exemptions were mostly captured by non-farm sectors, such as importers and banks, and not passed on to farmers. This finding is consistent with what is generally known about tax exemptions in countries all over the world; they are rarely effective and very difficult to target accurately and they entail substantial losses of public revenues. The scope of some of these tax exemptions was curtailed in the 2014/15 budget, which is a step in the right direction. Given these findings, the remaining tax exemptions should be abolished quickly so that public resources can be focussed on areas which can really deliver benefits for farmers.  Public expenditure can contribute to agricultural development, but to maximise the benefits from a highly constrained budget resource envelope, spending must be allocated efficiently. The priority for public spending on agriculture should be goods and services which clearly have the characteristics of public goods, in that they cannot be supplied by the market in an optimal manner. In addition, these goods should benefit the smallholder farmers who constitute the vast majority of farmers in Uganda. Examples of these goods and services are agricultural extension services and research and development.  The modernisation of agriculture requires comprehensive, country wide, agricultural extension services. Such a service will have to be funded predominantly with public resources. In addition, budget resources are needed to ensure that the rural infrastructure, such as rural feeder roads, is adequate to support commercial agriculture throughout the country. Scarce budget resources should not be misallocated to the provision and subsidy of marketable inputs, especially those which benefit mainly larger farmers.  The second issue I want to highlight is how we can develop a feasible strategy for the transformation of smallholder farming. Chapter 2.2 of the Yearbook presents some interesting 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  findings on projects run by the One Acre Fund which aim to support smallholders in East Africa; findings which are consistent with those of similar projects and of research in the region. The support which smallholder farmers need to enable them to increase their yields and raise their incomes is holistic. It includes technical advice and training in the use of improved agricultural techniques, the provision of improved seeds and fertilisers together with credit to purchase these inputs, with repayment of the credit aligned with the sale of farm output, and training and support for post harvest handling and storage. With such a holistic support package, substantial increases in farm output and incomes can be realised. The provision of finance alone will do little to help smallholder farmers overcome the constraints that they face in raising farm yields and marketing more of their output.  Unfortunately, only a small minority of the country’s more than 3 million smallholder farm households currently receive the type of holistic support provided by the One Acre Fund and similar projects, which addresses all of the constraints that they face. To modernise agriculture, this approach must be applied much more widely, so that all smallholders can benefit. Both the public sector and non government organisations can contribute to this objective, but it is self evident that substantial public resources will be required to fund it, which emphasises the importance of properly prioritising public spending on agriculture.  Modernising agriculture is one of the most difficult challenges facing Uganda, but given that more than 60 percent of the labour force relies on agriculture as their primary source of income, it is a challenge which is central to socio-economic development and poverty reduction. Despite the country’s abundant natural resources, Uganda’s agricultural performance has been poor; real output growth has failed to even match population growth rates over the last two decades and labour productivity in the sector is very low.  Modernising agriculture should be integral to Uganda’s development plans, but for that objective to be realised, we need well thought out feasible strategies, which focus on supporting smallholder farmers. By highlighting the constraints facing farmers in different sub-sectors in Uganda and initiatives which have helped to alleviate them, the Agricultural Finance Yearbook can contribute to the strengthening of our agricultural policies.  I would now like to formally launch the 2015 Agricultural Finance Yearbook.  Thank you for listening. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andrew Gracie: CCP resolution and the ending Too Big to Fail agenda Speech by Mr Andrew Gracie, Executive Director of Resolution of the Bank of England, at the 21st Annual Risk USA Conference, New York City, 22 October 2015. *      *      * One of the goals of global reform since the financial crisis has been ending Too Big to Fail (TBTF). This is the resolution agenda – aiming to ensure that in the event that a global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) fails there is minimal interruption of the activities of a firm that are critical to the functioning of the broader financial system. And achieving that outcome without recourse to taxpayer bailouts, as public authorities were forced to during the crisis. Progress in developing this new paradigm for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) has been impressive. Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions1 were agreed by G20 leaders around this time four years ago. Statutory regimes consistent with this standard are now in place in the US, EU and Japan – in fact in all but a handful of jurisdictions where G-SIBs are headquartered. Crisis Management Groups (CMGs) have been working on resolution plans for each of the G-SIBs. The authorities participating in the CMGs have committed at a senior level in a resolvability assessment process (RAP) to the resolution strategies emerging for each of the G-SIBs. These CMGs work towards identifying barriers to making resolution work and how these should be removed. Often these barriers are consistent across firms. Perhaps most notable is the requirement for loss absorbency – establishing a liability structure for G-SIBs that is consistent with bail-in, not bail-out. Again, there has been significant progress here. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued a consultation document2 on a minimum standard for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) last November and is committed to producing a final standard ahead of the G20 summit next month in Antalya. This will be a major step on the road to ending “Too Big to Fail.” Additionally, we need to pursue the same TBTF agenda for other types of G-SIFIs, in particular central counterparties (CCPs). I want to spend some time today talking to what – if anything – can be taken from the resolution of banks that is relevant for CCPs. Context for CCP resolution CCPs form a key part of the global financial landscape. They have become ever more important since the crisis. This will continue as mandatory central clearing is introduced around the world. Addressing the systemic risks associated with over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets is one of the reasons why G20 leaders introduced mandatory central clearing. People tell us that we have thus created in CCPs concentration risk and critical nodes. This is true in part, but we did this on the basis that in CCPs risks could be better recognised and identified, better managed and reduced via better netting. Nonetheless, as many before me have commented3 the largest CCPs are becoming increasingly systemic and interconnected such that their critical services could not stop suddenly without risk of wider contagion. Thus, not only do we have to ensure that the level of supervisory intensity matches the risks, something my                                                 1  http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_111104cc.pdf?page_moved=1  2  http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/TLAC-Press-release.pdf  3  Benoit Coeure, Central Counterparty Recovery and Resolution (Nov 2014); Paul Tucker, Are Clearing Houses the new Central Banks? (April 2014). 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  supervisory colleagues are very focused on, we must also address the issue of what should happen if a CCP were to fail. This is already widely recognised. So too is the need for an international solution to the questions that CCP recovery and resolution presents. The largest CCPs are systemically relevant at a global level, important for financial stability in multiple jurisdictions due to the nature of their business and the composition of their members and users. They serve multiple markets, having dozens of clearing members from different countries and clearing products in multiple currencies. A patch-work of approaches to recovery and resolution would risk regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortion and so, whilst the fiscal backstop against the unsuccessful resolution of a CCP is ultimately a national one, it is best that the answer on how to avoid this backstop ever being used is developed at a global level. Fortunately, that work is already underway and CCP recovery and resolution forms an important part of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) continuing agenda to end Too Big To Fail (TBTF). In October 2014 an Annex was added to the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes to cover their application to Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs)4. More recently, the FSB published its 2015 CCP workplan5. As part of this, a group on financial market infrastructure (fmi CBCM), equivalent to the Cross-Border Crisis Management Group (CBCM) that I chair for banks, has been established within the FSB to take forward international work on CCP resolution. Authorities in a number of jurisdictions are responding to the need for effective resolution arrangements for CCPs, with legislative proposals expected in the EU, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and elsewhere to add to existing regimes, including in the US under Title II of Dodd Frank. In the UK, the Bank of England has formal responsibility for the resolution of UK-incorporated CCPs. To aid us in drawing up resolution plans for UK CCPs, we have established the first Crisis Management Group for a CCP. We hope and expect it to be the first of many. But work on CCP resolution needs to be seen in the broader context of financial reform: • The Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures, along with the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO) is continuing its work on CCP resilience and recovery. Work is in train on stress testing, on loss allocation and on disclosure requirements, as well as on ensuring consistent application of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) which set regulatory expectations for CCPs at a global level. All of this is important not only in its own right, but also to provide the market – the users of CCPs – with the tools and incentives to monitor resilience and drive effective risk management in CCPs themselves. To encourage competition between CCPs on resilience, not cost. • At the same time, the first line of defence for a CCP lies in the resilience of its members. Ongoing work to raise the prudential standards for banks on capital and liquidity, among other areas, should greatly reduce the risk of CCPs having to deal with a failing clearing member. And the progress I mentioned before on G-SIB resolution should help to ensure that, where a firm does fail, its payment and delivery obligations to the CCP continue to be met. I should add as an aside that there is more still to be done internationally in terms of removing technical and other obstacles to maintaining continuity of access to CCPs and other FMIs in the context of bank resolution. That continuity is not just essential to the bank in resolution but may also be critical for clients. If there is doubt about continued access to clearing services from a bank in resolution, clients may look to migrate rapidly to another provider. These                                                 4 FSB, (October 2014) Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/2014/10/r_141015/?page_moved=1  5  http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/Joint-CCP-Workplan-for-2015-For-Publication.pdf  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  issues around continuity and portability will be the subject of work within the FSB over the course of the coming year. Together, these initiatives to improve the resilience and recovery arrangements for CCPs and their members will help to reduce the probability of CCP default. But while improvements to resilience are necessary they may not by themselves be sufficient. No institution is “fail sfe”. Ultimately, we need to have a credible resolution approach for CCPs. If we do, resolution should offer a continuing benefit in helping to incentivise recovery by removing expectations that the taxpayer will be compelled to step in. By contrast, if we do not have a credible regime in resolution, we run the risk of weakening the incentives both to manage a CCP prudently, as well as incentives for clearing members to contribute to a CCP’s recovery should it get into trouble. The benefits of resolution to market discipline and recovery are common to all financial institutions. But that is not the only insight from banks that is relevant to CCPs. Before going too far in talking up the similarities, I should note – although it should go without saying – that CCPs are very different from their bank clearing members in many important respects, including their business models, legal structures and balance sheets. CCP recovery and resolution therefore poses some specific issues, some of which I will touch on today. However, at base there are principles that are common to the resolution of any systemically important institution. Perhaps the most obvious similarity between the resolution of banks and CCPs is in the common objective: resolution should deliver continuity of critical economic functions without reliance on solvency support from taxpayers to achieve it. For that continuity to be achieved it is not enough that the financial losses of the institution are fully absorbed; the going-concern resources of the institution, or of any successor institution, must be restored to a sufficient level to command market confidence prior to any post-resolution restructuring or wind-down. In the case of banks, this means that when a bank suffers losses eroding its going concern capital to the point where triggers for resolution are met, (i) it enters into resolution; (ii) its creditors are bailed in to recapitalise the firm; and (iii) this bail-in replicates what would have happened in a court-based commercial restructuring or insolvency. In other words, losses are allocated according to the creditor hierarchy but without the value destruction created by the hard stop of insolvency. This ensures that the resolution provides continuity and meets the safeguard that creditors are not worse off than in insolvency. While these are the essential elements of a resolution, they are likely to play out differently in the context of a CCP. Loss absorbing capacity for CCP resolution Let me start by discussing the loss-absorbing capacity needed for CCP resolution. The use of a bail-in tool on a bank unlocks the loss absorbing capacity of the non-equity part of its balance sheet, the part that would otherwise only bear loss in insolvency or in a voluntary restructuring. Applying this concept of going and gone concern resources to CCPs is a less straightforward task. Unlike a bank, a CCP’s own loss absorbing resources sit both on its balance sheet as margin and default fund and off it in the form of contingent claims on its members. Consistent with the PFMIs, these arrangements are intended to be comprehensive at least insofar as they cover losses that could arise from clearing member default. That begs a question as to what additional loss absorbency the resolution of a CCP can currently unlock that recovery cannot unlock already. The question of loss absorbency is one that the FSB is looking at. Do we need additional resources in the waterfall beyond existing funded and unfunded resources? If additional resources are required, should the initial margin held by a CCP be made available if it would have suffered losses in insolvency? Or should CCPs hold other resolution resources instead? 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  I will not prejudge that debate here. However, I do think there is value in clarifying what is meant by the expression “TLAC for CCPs”. Total loss absorbing capacity is not simply short-hand for subordinated debt. It is instead a qualitative judgement about the credibility and feasibility of the different types of resources of a CCP to absorb loss and replenish its going concern requirements. CCPs have different liability structures from banks and therefore the assessment of the absorbency of these structures and the appropriateness of additional forms of LAC is more likely to be different from banks than it is to be the same. That assessment of LAC will need to consider the extent to which unfunded commitments from members can be relied upon given the procyclicality of calling for them in stressed circumstances. It means assessing the credibility of allocating losses via cash calls or variation margin haircutting and the incentives that this generates in clearing members and clients to continue to clear through the CCP. And it also means looking not just at loss absorbency for clearing member default but also at the CCP’s capacity to absorb losses and recapitalise where a loss springs from operational or other losses not covered in full by loss allocation arrangements with its members. Point of entry to resolution One issue that is necessarily intertwined with the question of resources is the point of entry into resolution. As I have described, resolution is a financial reconstruction. For it to be effective it cannot be exercised only once the financial resources in a firm have already been exhausted. If it is decided that the resources available for resolution lie principally within the existing waterfall, that would further suggest that resolution authorities must have the ability to intervene and to take action before the end of the waterfall. But where does that boundary lie? The UK resolution regime sets the statutory definition for entry to resolution as being the point where the CCP is failing or likely to fail and there is no reasonable prospect of action being taken to restore it to viability. Integral to this test is the principle that this is a forward-looking judgement, capable of being exercised flexibly at different points in a CCP’s distress and dependent on a multitude of factors that drive an eventual decision at the time. That can make it difficult to pin down a single universal trigger point but it is possible to identify some circumstances that could be indicative of this boundary being reached. Those possible scenarios could include an assessment that the default management procedures of the CCP have failed, or are likely to fail, to both absorb losses fully and replenish the CCP’s resources in a sufficiently timely manner to allow the CCP to continue to operate. That failure might arise through legal challenge hindering the default management process or from an assessment that if the losses were allowed to continue they would exceed caps on contributions and could not be credibly absorbed via other means. It could also similarly arise from a determination that there is no realistic prospect of a successful auction to return to a matched book or that the CCP’s own rules to allocate losses or tear up contracts are either not yet available to it or will undermine financial stability or the objective of continuity through full tear-up and closure of the service. So – in line with the Key Attributes – it needs to be possible to place the CCP into resolution before its loss allocation rules are exhausted. These are all examples of entry into resolution caused by clearing member default. But non-default losses could also bring a CCP down and it is certainly possible that a breach of a CCP’s regulatory requirements with no reasonable likelihood of replenishing its capital would present a trigger point for intervention. I have mentioned the incompatibility of full-tear up with the objective of continuity. But an intervention by a resolution authority cannot by itself guarantee a successful auction. To do so, may still require partial tear-up and forced allocation and these would seem to be necessary tools in any resolution toolkit for a CCP. How losses are then allocated upon tear-up again 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  goes to the question of the timing of intervention and whether the tear-up takes place before the resources available to a CCP have been exhausted or after it. Creditor safeguards and CCP resolution Intervention by a resolution authority, especially at a point where default management procedures have yet to be exhausted is action that cannot be taken lightly. Nor can the discretion of a resolution authority to deviate from the existing rules of the CCP be unbounded. Appropriate creditor safeguards are central to ensuring that an effective resolution regime does not unduly interfere with property rights or undermine its own value by introducing unnecessary uncertainty into a financial institution’s contractual relationships both in resolution and outside of it. Perhaps the most fundamental safeguard to creditors in resolution is that the actions of the resolution authority will not leave them worse off than if the authority had not intervened and the firm had instead entered a liquidation proceeding. For the purposes of determining this No Creditor Worse Off protection6, bank resolution takes an insolvency counterfactual; recognition that a failing bank that meets the conditions for resolution would in most likelihood lose its licence at that point if not resolved, thereby tipping it into insolvency (whether cash-flow, balance-sheet or both) if it was not there already. That insolvency counterfactual requires an ex post assessment of the value of assets and liabilities of the firm. That is no easy task but one that can, and has been, credibly undertaken. For CCPs the task of assessing an insolvency counterfactual is likely to be harder still – particularly if it must rely upon a forecast of how the rest of the waterfall would have unfolded, the behaviour of the CCP’s participants and the movements of the markets in the days that would have followed if resolution had not taken place. A liquidation counterfactual must also confront the argument that the CCP would have protected itself from insolvency through full tear-up. Given these valuation challenges, I suspect there will need to be careful further consideration given to the formulation and practical application of the NCWO safeguard; we must end up with a safeguard that is sufficiently certain and capable of estimation in advance that both creditors and resolution authorities are able to make sensible decisions before, during and after resolution. With that, let me conclude by summing up some key points: • CCP resolution is both a necessary and inevitable part of the overall post-crisis reform agenda to end Too Big to Fail. As private, profit-making enterprises CCPs must be allowed to fail, but, given their systemic importance, many will need to be allowed to do so in a manner that maintains the continuity of their critical functions. • Having a credible resolution regime for Clearing Members is a big step forward in helping to reduce the risk of clearing member default and from that the risk of CCP failure. • But reliance on successful resolution of members does not negate the need for CCP resolution arrangements to be capable of responding to both default and non-default losses emerging from both systemic and idiosyncratic shocks. • In thinking about the underlying objectives and needs of a CCP resolution regime, there are many similarities to bank resolution and these should not be forgotten, but clearly there are many differences too and we need to recognise that.                                                 6  See Section 5 of the Key Attributes on Safeguards.  
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • Effective resolution requires the ability to act promptly and before the point at which the chance of stabilising the CCP is lost. The resolution authority must have a variety of tools at its disposal to enable it to respond to the reason the CCP failed. It should be able to intervene in a timely and forward-looking way before the end of the waterfall – but incentives must be aligned and we want this to be set up in a way that promotes CCP resilience and makes recovery work. • In order to continue a CCP’s critical services in resolution, there must be an ability both to cover the losses credibly in a failure scenario and to recapitalise the CCP’s going concern resources – i.e. its capital, margin and default fund. How we achieve this is something for FSB to address so that the shared interest in maintaining stability in the global financial system can be realised. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stephen S Poloz: Release of the Financial System Review Opening statement by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the press conference following the release of the Financial System Review, Ottawa, Ontario, 15 December 2015. *      *      * Good morning. It’s a pleasure for Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and me to be with you today to talk about the December issue of the Bank’s Financial System Review (FSR), which we published this morning. Let me take a moment to give some context for this report. The FSR highlights key financial vulnerabilities and some potential triggers that could turn those vulnerabilities into risks to the stability of Canada’s financial system. The FSR is an essential complement to our Monetary Policy Report – together, these two reports give the basis for a complete discussion of monetary policy within our risk-management framework. At our last interest rate announcement, we kept our key policy rate unchanged, as the economy was unfolding reasonably in line with our latest projection in October. We also said that risks to financial stability were evolving as expected. Today’s FSR provides the analysis behind that assessment. Our interest in financial stability risk has grown since the financial crisis, for two distinct reasons. First, the global regulatory architecture has been strengthened to prevent future crises, and how the system adapts to those changes needs to be well understood. Second, persistently very low interest rates in response to the crisis are fuelling new financial vulnerabilities that bear constant monitoring. Let me start with the financial stability implications of new regulations for financial intermediaries. The global financial system is clearly safer than it was before the crisis. This is important, for it means that vulnerabilities that appear worrisome today need to be assessed against a more resilient system. At the same time, our financial system is adapting to new regulations, and we must be alert for any new vulnerabilities that might emerge as a result. As one example, some observers contend that new capital and liquidity rules have led to reduced market-making in secondary fixed-income markets and may also be responsible for occasional liquidity shortfalls and market gaps. We analyze this vulnerability in greater depth in today’s FSR. In fact, it is proving very difficult to assess the liquidity issue empirically. Most of the available data suggest that government-bond liquidity may have improved in recent years, but these data tell only part of the story. The Bank recently established the Canadian Fixed-Income Forum to enable a continuing dialogue, and we’ve modified our operations to help alleviate some of these issues. The Governing Council believes it’s important to continue studying the matter, not just as it pertains to government bonds, but also to other asset classes. Given the new regulatory architecture, we may not know just how resilient market liquidity is until there’s a true stress event. Let me now turn to vulnerabilities being created by persistently very low interest rates in Canada. The post-crisis situation has quite naturally fuelled the accumulation of household debt, as well as heightened activity in the housing sector. We can observe other elements of risky financial behaviour, but these two vulnerabilities have been our main focus for some time and have continued to grow in importance since our last FSR. In terms of household debt, income growth hasn’t kept pace with increases in borrowing, since mortgage growth continues to rise. More borrowing was expected, given the reductions in our policy interest rate earlier this year. It’s important to remember that while rate reductions have increased vulnerabilities at the margin, they’ve also mitigated the risk to the 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  financial system by helping offset the decline in incomes and employment tied to the drop in commodity prices. Our analysis shows that there has been an increase in the number of highly indebted households in Canada, by which I mean those whose debts are more than 350 per cent of their annual gross income. Not only are there more of these highly indebted households, they also carry a growing share of household debt. These people are more likely to live in British Columbia, Alberta or Ontario, where house price gains have been the largest. The Governing Council’s reading of the situation is that these vulnerabilities are quite highly concentrated – about 720,000 households fall into this vulnerable category. In terms of the housing market, we continue to see regional markets evolving along different tracks, as we’ve indicated before. Activity in the energy-producing regions of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador has declined noticeably, which was expected following the decline in oil prices. The housing markets of Toronto and Vancouver have seen renewed momentum, driven by stronger employment growth and migration, both interprovincial and international. The Governing Council’s base-case scenario continues to be a constructive one: housing activity should stabilize in line with economic growth as the driver of growth in the economy switches from household spending to non-resource exports. However, recent momentum in prices in Toronto and Vancouver may increase the likelihood of a correction in house prices, which could affect vulnerable households. Unsurprisingly, house prices are correcting in oil-producing regions. As in the past, we have illustrated how certain triggers could turn these vulnerabilities into full-blown risks to the Canadian financial system. Risks assessed in this FSR are (1) a severe recession that would reduce households’ ability to service their mortgages and cause a broad correction in house prices; (2) an unexpectedly sharp rise in global risk premiums that could spill over to the cost of domestic financing; (3) economic or financial stress emanating from China and other emerging markets; and (4) more downside risk in resource pricing. These risks are not meant to be exhaustive but rather are used to illustrate the potential consequences of the vulnerabilities we have identified. Other possible triggers might include a large-scale credit event in the global resource sector or a sovereign credit event, for example. The Governing Council acknowledges that certain vulnerabilities are still edging higher, but the overall level of risk they pose to the Canadian financial system has remained roughly unchanged since our June report. In this regard, recent changes by Canadian authorities to the rules for mortgage financing will help to mitigate these risks as we move into 2016. Finally, I’d note that the FSR features reports that take a close look at aspects of the Canadian and global financial systems. With this issue, there’s a report that analyzes the microdata related to household debt, as well as a review of mortgage securitization in Canada. These are very important and useful reports, and I hope you’ll take the time to read them. With that, Carolyn and I will be happy to respond to your questions. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Takehiro Sato: Recent economic and financial developments and monetary policy in Japan Speech by Mr Takehiro Sato, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Nara, 7 December 2015. *      *      * The charts can be found at the Bank of Japan’s website http://www.boj.or.jp/en/whatsnew/index.htm/. Introduction Thank you for giving me this opportunity to exchange views with people representing the political, economic, and financial communities of Nara Prefecture. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japan’s Osaka Branch. In today’s speech, I will begin by focusing on recent economic and financial developments in Japan and abroad, as well as the Bank’s monetary policy. I will then touch briefly on the economy of Nara Prefecture. Following my speech, I would like to hear your views on actual conditions in the local economy and on the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy. I.  Recent economic and financial developments in Japan and abroad A.  Overseas economies Overseas economies – mainly advanced economies – have continued to grow at a moderate pace, despite the slowdown in emerging economies. In a situation where commodity and energy prices remain sluggish, the growth rates of emerging and commodity-exporting economies have not risen, and advanced economies have been affected partly by the decrease in investment related to resource development. This presumably means that the decline in commodity and energy prices, which at first was expected to have favorable effects on the world economy as a whole, is not only due to the supply factor but also has been influenced to a certain degree by the demand factor; namely, a decline in demand from China and other emerging economies. Regarding the supply factor, the textbook view that supply is automatically adjusted through the price mechanism appears to not necessarily fit with reality, as resource developers continue to operate at prices below the breakeven point in order to recover the sunk cost, for example. Considering this situation, it is difficult in the short term to envision a scenario of commodity and energy prices recovering remarkably and to expect a situation where the growth rate of commodity-exporting economies would increase. Therefore, even if emerging economies gradually move out of their deceleration phase due to favorable effects of the growth in advanced economies, the pace of increase in the growth rate of the world economy as a whole may continue to accelerate only moderately. Recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also been fairly consistently revising downward its forecast of global growth in its World Economic Outlook (Chart 1). Although the Chinese economy has been slowing somewhat, mainly in the manufacturing sector, its services sector has been firm (Chart 2). Under the authorities’ strong commitment to supporting growth, the economy is expected to broadly follow a stable growth path, albeit with the growth rate continuing to slow somewhat, as the authorities proactively carry out policy measures to support economic activity from both the fiscal and financial sides (Chart 3). However, there are signs of deflationary pressure from asset price adjustments, as shown in the GDP deflator turning negative again in the GDP statistics for the July-September quarter, and this warrants attention. The key to realizing stable growth will be whether the economy can shift from being investment- and export-driven to being domestic demand-driven, accompanied by structural reforms. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  I see downside risks to the outlook that I have just described, and note the following three points. First, the growth of the world economy is disproportionately led and driven by that of the United States. The expansionary phase of the U.S. economy already has lasted for around seven years since the global financial crisis, representing the fourth longest period of expansion in the postwar era, and from the perspective of the economic cycle, it can be said that the expansionary phase is maturing. Of course, under pressure from balance sheet adjustments, the pace of recovery after the global financial crisis has been moderate compared with that in past recovery phases, so making a simplistic comparison in terms of the duration of expansion may be problematic. However, if wage growth – which so far has been lagging – gains momentum while the slack in the labor market diminishes gradually, it seems it will be necessary to keep in mind the risk that the economy may enter an adjustment phase due to the narrowing of the margin for firms. Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve intends to normalize the monetary policy at a moderate pace. I would like to watch how the normalization of interest rates plays out in relation to the duration of the expansionary phase. Second, in Europe, there remain various adjustment pressures; in addition, the refugee problem is emerging as a serious challenge. For example, an agreement of sorts was reached among relevant countries on the Greek debt problem around the middle of the year. This is supposed to inject capital into banks at an early date in order to maintain financial system stability, but drastic measures to reduce sovereign debt have yet to be drafted. In this situation, there is a fair possibility that the debt problem will attract attention once again. Moreover, the influx of refugees will likely increase the fiscal burden on European countries for the moment. Third, in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the pace of recovery may slow on the whole, albeit with differences across countries and regions, if the slump in commodity and energy prices is prolonged, or if the outflow of funds from those economies escalates in the global financial markets due to an interest rate hike in the United States. In particular, I have concern about the impact that may hit the fiscal position of oil-producing countries and the possibility of geopolitical risks growing if the slump in crude oil prices is prolonged. B.  Global financial markets The global financial markets grew risk-averse toward summer 2015 because of such factors as concerns over the slowdown in the Chinese economy. Although such concerns remain, there has been an improvement in the market’s risk appetite due to last month’s employment statistics, which showed the steadiness of the U.S. economy, and to the proactive stance of the European Central Bank (ECB) on additional monetary easing. Although there are heightened expectations among market participants that the interest rate hike will be implemented in the United States at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting this December, there has been no sign so far of the risk aversion trend flaring up again, as the Federal Reserve has carefully engaged in communication with market participants. While there remain concerns over a further outflow of funds from some emerging markets that may be triggered by the interest rate hike, I expect that the first such hike since the global financial crisis will be welcomed as an event symbolic of the U.S. economic recovery, and also will lead to dispelling the uncertainties that have hung over the global financial markets for a long time. Looking forward, the first point that we should keep in mind under these circumstances is the impact of a decline in market liquidity. The exchange rate reform of the Chinese yuan was presumably the direct trigger of the global turmoil that occurred this summer, and issues regarding the Chinese currency and monetary authorities’ communication have been pointed out on various occasions. However, at a more fundamental level, I have the sense that the global financial markets were affected to a certain degree by the fact that market liquidity declined because risk taking by major market makers was constrained by the full-fledged enforcement of the so-called Volcker rule since July, and consequently the presence of technical players – that is, players engaging in algorithmic trading and high frequency trading (HFT) – grew amid the thin summertime trading volume. I feel it is necessary to carefully 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  monitor whether or not something trivial could lead to market instability not only in summer but also at other times, such as the end of the year or quarter, when liquidity tends to decline due to various constraints imposed by regulation (Chart 4). Second, there is a possibility that the U.S. dollar funding cost will hover at a high level due to structural factors. The cost of converting yen into U.S. dollars in the swap market has been increasing and the basis swap spread has widened, as expectations for the interest rate hike in the United States have mounted, in addition to the usual end-of-year strengthening of demand for U.S. dollar funds (Chart 5). While I assume that Japanese banks already have been making efforts to enhance their stable foreign-currency funding base while expanding their overseas business, I feel that it is necessary to carefully monitor this situation. The Bank, in cooperation with the Federal Reserve, has a backstop in place in the form of the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, but I would like to reemphasize the importance of financial institutions’ efforts to secure their own stable funding base. The third point is the impact of additional monetary easing by the ECB on the global financial markets. In Europe, the presence of negative interest rates already has become prevalent in some countries in relation to the currency policy, even before the deposit rate reduction by the ECB to a negative rate. The ECB’s recent deposit rate reduction is expected to escalate this situation. The yield curve in Germany, used as a benchmark, had temporarily turned negative with respect to bonds with maturities of six or seven years. I am keeping a close watch on how such an interest rate formation, coupled with the interest rate hike in the United States, will affect the flow of funds in the global financial markets, and whether or not the flattening of the yield curve will undermine the sustainability of government bond purchasing by the ECB from the perspective of the sustainability of the Bank’s purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), which I will describe later. C.  Japan’s economy Looking at developments in Japan’s economy, indicators had been relatively weak for the April-June quarter through the July-September quarter, particularly on the industrial production side, and real GDP had declined for two consecutive quarters (Chart 6). Given this situation, there are views, mainly among overseas media, that Japan’s economy has technically entered a recessionary phase due to the slowdown in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly China. That being said, on the back of an increase in receipts of income from overseas business reflecting the yen’s depreciation, as well as an improvement in the terms of trade due to the declines in energy and commodity prices, firms have seen record profits, which consequently is reflected in gross national income (GNI) and gross domestic income (GDI) having been on clear increasing trends compared to GDP. The mechanism of aggregate income formation has been relatively robust and business sentiment at a high level (Chart 7). Thus, it seems that the economy has been resilient recently to exogenous shocks to a certain extent, such as the slowdown in overseas economies. In fact, despite relatively weak indicators of exports and industrial production, domestic demand has maintained its resilience, mainly in private consumption, and a virtuous cycle from income to spending has continued to operate on the whole. Final demand also remained firm in the July-September quarter. This is contrary to what the economy experienced from 2007 until the global financial crisis occurred in 2008, when Japan’s economy actually entered a recessionary phase triggered by the slowdown in overseas economies as the terms of trade deteriorated because of the surge in energy and commodity prices. Let me add a few things about exports and industrial production. Real exports have been picking up slightly recently, albeit with a rising concern over the slowdown in the Chinese economy (Chart 8). This is suggested by the divergence between the volume of exports in trade statistics and figures for real exports, which might be attributable to a rise in exports of goods with relatively high value-added – such as electronic parts and devices – observed after the July-September quarter, reflecting the product life-cycle of mobile phones. Moreover, strength in imports is also a reflection of firmness in domestic demand. Meanwhile, although 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the July-September quarter represented the second consecutive quarter of decrease in industrial production, it is expected to pick up in the October-December quarter, mainly due to the increase in production of automobiles. We are currently in a puzzling situation where exports have been more or less flat while industrial production has posted a relatively clear decrease and business sentiment has generally stayed at a high level. However, such firm business sentiment is evidence that a “mirage of demand,” which commonly occurs during an economic recession, is not taking place, and weakness in industrial production might be only due to the base year of statistics on production being set at 2010, which has not been revised for a while, thus making it difficult to fully reflect the increase in the weight of goods with high value-added brought about by the recent changes in the production structure. That being said, it is unclear whether the virtuous cycle from income to spending is strongly at work. For example, although firms’ fixed investment plans have been at high levels, coincident and leading indicators such as shipments of capital goods and machinery orders suggest that actual business fixed investment has been sluggish, and real business fixed investment on a GDP basis can be assessed as having been more or less unchanged, or even fallen marginally (Chart 9). In addition, firms still seem to have a negative stance toward increasing spending that could lead to an expansion in fixed costs, as seen in the fact that base pay has increased for two consecutive years but the pace has remained only moderate (Chart 10). One of the reasons behind firms maintaining such a cautious stance toward spending would be that the deflationary mindset has not been dispelled in a broad sense. In addition to this, even though corporate profits had registered a record high recently, this was not due to an increase in sales volume, but rather to an increase in foreign exchange gains of income from overseas business reflecting the yen’s depreciation, as well as to a decrease in input costs stemming from the decline in commodity prices. Therefore, firms do not consider the improvement in their profits to be indicative of a permanent increase in income, and remain cautious about expanding their fixed costs. In other words, their growth expectations for profits may not have risen that much. In an effort to assist firms from the financial side, the Bank has been taking the initiative to create accommodative financial conditions through, for example, the fund-provisioning measure to support strengthening the foundations for economic growth. In raising growth expectations, however, there are many issues beyond the scope of monetary policy, and I consider it important for the government to make strenuous efforts to change firms’ and households’ expectations by steadily implementing the growth strategy. In relation to firms’ stance toward spending, I also would like to touch on the annual labor-management wage negotiations in spring 2016. A sustainable rise in workers’ base pay is one of the key points for achieving steady recovery in household consumption expenditure and raising people’s medium- to long-term inflation expectations, which appear to remain lower than those in the U.S. and European economies. Thus, I am paying attention to whether or not base pay will see a rise for a third consecutive year in the annual labor-management wage negotiations in spring 2016. Although the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) has presented a basic stance toward the next spring wage negotiations – namely, demanding a base pay increase of about 2 percent – it is uncertain how rises in the underlying trend in inflation and the outlook for prices will be reflected in base pay. I therefore expect the government to take initiatives such as deregulating the labor market so that firms can find it easier to decide on a base pay increase. D.  Prices Let me now turn to developments in prices. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food has been about 0 percent recently due to the decline in energy prices (Chart 11). The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy, on the other hand, has been about 1 percent recently, and the ratio of increasing and decreasing items in the CPI and the year-on-year rate of change in the trimmed mean have been increasing moderately. In addition, people’s medium- to long-term 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole, albeit with some weakness, partly due to changes in the behavioral patterns of firms and households since the introduction of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE). Given these factors, the Bank is of the view that the underlying trend in inflation has been rising steadily. I am aware that there are various views on how to assess the underlying trend in inflation. In a situation where price indicators have been affected significantly recently by the short-term fluctuations in energy prices, it does sound reasonable to look at the CPI excluding energy prices. Nonetheless, as I will describe later, I believe that it is necessary to closely examine a wide range of price indicators, including wages, as the recent rise in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy might only be attributable to households’ acceptance of price rises, mainly in daily necessities, brought about by the decline in energy prices. With these factors in mind, I would like to discuss recent developments in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy. There is a view that its recent rise can be inferred from the yen’s depreciation observed since the expansion of QQE at end-October 2014, and that such a rise will peak out after the turn of fiscal 2016 as no further depreciation is expected. I would say, however, that it seems unreasonable to explain the recent developments in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy in a consistent manner by the yen’s depreciation alone, as prices of food products and durable goods – leading to the recent rise in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy – have resumed a clear uptrend recently under the yen’s depreciation trend that has generally lasted since around the introduction of QQE in April 2013. I consider that the recent rise is actually attributable to the fact that households have more readily accepted price rises on the back of moderate improvement in the employment and income situation as well as the decline in energy prices, and firms accordingly have taken a somewhat aggressive stance of setting higher prices. Yet, it is uncertain whether or not households will continue to accept price rises if the effects of the decline in energy prices dissipate. Moreover, if no further depreciation of the yen is expected, it is likely that prices of food products and durable goods will stop rising. In view of these possibilities, the key to whether or not the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy will remain stable at around 1 percent will likely lie in whether rises in services prices – which have been lagging recently – would start to be observed following the wage negotiations for fiscal 2016. There are uncertainties over future developments in the wage negotiations, as I mentioned earlier, and also downside risks as to whether price rises in daily necessities and durable goods will lead to a rise in services prices. In my opinion, however, it is possible to generally maintain the annual growth pace of around 1 percent throughout the projection period, excluding the effects of the decline in energy prices. As a member of the Policy Board – which has the responsibility to ensure price stability – I made all efforts to present the most probable scenario in the October 2015 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). In my view, whether or not the underlying trend in inflation will jump to 2 percent depends on whether people’s medium- to long-term inflation expectations will jump to around 2 percent, and this suggests that people’s expectations are unlikely to become so bullish within the projection period as wages have not yet risen to that level. II.  Future conduct of monetary policy A.  QQE It has been two years and eight months since the introduction of QQE. My evaluation of the policy is that, as evidenced by economic and market developments during this period, the intended purpose of promoting the conversion of the deflationary mindset is gradually being achieved, although we are still only halfway toward accomplishing this goal. Meanwhile, in the October 2015 Outlook Report, it was projected that the timing of reaching the price stability target would be delayed to around the second half of fiscal 2016 (Chart 12). I am aware that, consequently, there are various views on the Bank’s commitment to achieving the price stability 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  target of 2 percent in a stable manner at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years. Given this situation, I find it necessary to go over what I had explained about the Bank’s commitment, and would also like to share my thinking again. I consider this commitment to be a rolling target. It is not intended to achieve a specific price level within a specific time frame but rather to achieve the price stability target at the earliest possible time with a time horizon of about two years. I also regard the price stability target itself as a flexible concept with a certain range for upward and downward deviations of the actual inflation rate from the target. I believe such commitment is as reasonable as the framework of the inflation target adopted by central banks in other major countries. In fact, developments in prices depend, for example, on those in crude oil prices in the short term, and inflation expectations that affect the underlying trend in inflation are susceptible to monetary policy as well as other factors that cannot necessarily be controlled directly through the conduct of monetary policy, such as the outcome of wage negotiations and growth expectations. As I have stated before, prices reflect the state of the economy and are not a variable that can be directly operated by a central bank. Therefore, the policy conduct aiming at a specific inflation rate within a specific time frame seems unreasonable in the first place, and if a central bank persists in achieving such an aim, there may be a risk that its credibility will be undermined. Let me reiterate the significance of achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. The price stability target is set based on the CPI for all items, and as reference figures to capture its underlying trend, the Bank has used the CPI for all items less fresh food in presenting the Policy Board members’ projections. However, unlike the cases in Europe and the United States, the CPI entails statistical problems in that stickiness of fees for public services is high and that private rent and imputed rent structurally exert downward pressure on it. Thus, the CPI, which is included in official statistics compiled by the government, seems to have deviated recently from being in line with people’s perception of inflation that reflects a price rise in daily necessities, as shown, for example, in the University of Tokyo Daily Price Index and the SRI-Hitotsubashi Consumer Purchase Price Index. In particular, the year-on-year rate of increase in the SRI-Hitotsubashi Unit Value Price Index – which factors in firms’ strategy to maintain sales prices by making frequent changes in their products – has been around 2 percent recently, representing somewhat more of an acceleration than that in the CPI for the same items covered by this index (Chart 13). If the Bank conducts its monetary policy by focusing only on the CPI in official statistics, in a situation where people’s perception of inflation level exceeds its growth rate, there is a possibility that people would come to feel an excessive rise in prices, and that could cause many distortions in their sentiment and actual spending behavior (Chart 14). What matters is that the inflation rate rises in balance with wages as the level of economic activity increases. With these factors in mind, I would like to reemphasize that achieving 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for all items is not the ultimate goal of the price stability target, but rather that its achievement should be assessed flexibly from various aspects while examining a wide range of price indicators. B.  Continuation of QQE Meanwhile, it seems that market participants still hold expectations for a further expansion of QQE. I believe this might be attributable not only to interpretation of the price stability target, as I explained earlier, but also to the thinking regarding the effects of QQE; namely, that easing and tightening effects would depend on the flow – that is, the amount – of financial assets to be purchased by the Bank. Theoretically speaking, however, the effects of QQE have the nature of strengthening cumulatively with the progress in the Bank’s asset purchases. This means that, even if the Bank maintains the same amount of asset purchases, monetary easing effects will strengthen as long as it continues with the purchases. Therefore, I hold the view that the Bank’s decision at each monetary policy meeting to continue with the current QQE in and of itself is very critical in terms of monetary easing effects.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  The Bank has committed to purchasing JGBs so that its net holdings will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. Nonetheless, considering that the amount of redemption of its JGB holdings will increase, the amount of purchases on a gross basis is likely to rise even under the current policy commitment. For this reason, the Bank’s presence in the JGB market could increase further, although this also will depend on the government’s JGB issuance plan. Given this situation, for the Bank’s explanation – namely, that massive purchases of JGBs are carried out only in the context of the conduct of monetary policy and not in any way to finance the fiscal deficit – to remain fully persuasive, I also would like to reiterate that the government’s commitment toward fiscal consolidation is important.  As I mentioned earlier, monetary easing effects appear cumulatively in theory, but in terms of positive effects and side effects, it is likely that the easing effects have been diminishing marginally, since the pace of decline in nominal interest rates has been minimal despite the progress in the Bank’s purchases, as evidenced by a limited decline in longer-term interest rates since the expansion of QQE at end-October 2014. There is no doubt that policy effects are always accompanied by side effects, and I believe that a basic approach is to decide on the continuation of monetary policy after comparing and examining its positive effects and side effects. I initially did not expect that QQE, which is a kind of shock therapy that influences formation of people’s inflation expectations through massive asset purchases, would be continued for a very long time, and am concerned about a possibility that continuation of the policy will cause the positive effects to decline marginally while the side effects increase marginally. C.  Sustainability of the bank’s market operations As the Bank continues with its JGB purchases at the current pace, the amount outstanding of JGBs in the markets will decrease by the difference between the amounts of the government’s net issuance and the Bank’s net purchases. Since the amount outstanding in the markets is limited, the Bank will not be able to continue with the purchases at the current pace indefinitely. In reality, financial institutions have reasons to hold a certain amount of JGBs, such as for use as collateral, so they would stop selling their holdings to the Bank before the amount outstanding in the markets hits the bottom. At this point, it is difficult to project when this critical point is likely to happen, because financial institutions’ incentive to sell their JGB holdings is expected to depend on the interest rate level and the shape of yield curves at each point in time. If QQE continues to exert its intended effects and market participants’ medium- to long-term inflation expectations rise, the yield curve will steepen and financial institutions will have greater incentive to sell their JGB holdings. On the other hand, in a case where the conversion of the deflationary mindset does not make progress and market participants’ medium- to long-term inflation expectations do not rise, the yield curve would flatten and financial institutions would have a stronger preference for JGB holdings. Therefore, the Bank’s massive JGB purchases involve difficulties, in that there is a possibility that they become easier if the probability of realizing the policy objectives rises, whereas the Bank’s market operations might become problematic if realizing these objectives is considered to be difficult. Thus, when judging the necessity of continuing QQE, I would like to take into account the sustainability of the Bank’s market operations. Concluding remarks: economic activity in nara prefecture My concluding remarks will touch on the economy of Nara Prefecture. Compared with the national average, the industrial structure of Nara Prefecture is characterized by the large weights of not only local industries – such as plastics, rubber, and textiles – but also of electrical machinery and general machinery. The prefecture is also well known for its production of such items as cha sen (a tea ceremony tool), sumi ink, ink brushes, leather products, and somen noodles, as well as goldfish farming. Although the economy of 
   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Nara Prefecture has shown weakness recently in terms of production, a moderate recovery is underway. Production has been declining mainly because of decreases in electrical machinery and general machinery. Meanwhile, in the household sector, the active job openings-to-applicants ratio is rising moderately and employee income has been above the previous year’s levels. Private consumption has been recovering on the whole, as retail sales have remained robust, despite the continued weakness of passenger-car sales (Chart 15). From a longer-term perspective, the transfer of production sites from Nara Prefecture to other locations, including foreign countries, has been proceeding amid intense international competition. In addition to such dwindling sources of employment, there also has been the critical challenge of responding to the aging of society coupled with the low birthrate and shrinking population, which reflects Nara Prefecture’s history of development as a commuter town for neighboring large cities such as Osaka and Kyoto. However, I hear that Nara Prefecture already has been conducting broad-ranging activities through cooperation between the public and private sectors in order to deal with this challenge. For example, as an initiative to become more than just a commuter town, the prefecture is inviting businesses from the outside and promoting the development of local industries by creating an industrial cluster area at a convenient location close to an expressway. Over a period of eight years, the prefecture succeeded in inviting 205 projects for factories and other facilities. In addition, in the southern and eastern parts of the prefecture, where large tracts of abandoned farmland exist, agriculture promotion measures are being implemented to encourage a shift to the so-called sixth industry, including such activities as opening a privately run auberge (restaurant equipped with boarding facilities) using local food materials. In April next year, NARA Agriculture and Food International College will be opened. Furthermore, Nara Prefecture has an abundance of tourism resources, including several World Heritage sites, and the number of visitors has been rising, partly as a result of an increase in foreign visitors in recent years. Until now, there has been a scarcity of inns and hotels in the prefecture, so the rising number of visitors has failed to increase overnight stays, meaning that its tourism resources have not necessarily been utilized sufficiently. However, I hear that there is an ongoing project, in order to resolve the shortage of hotel rooms, to build a large hotel at a site in Nara City that is owned by the prefectural government. I am hoping that Nara Prefecture will further revitalize its economy by continuing with steady efforts to do so through cooperation between the public and private sectors. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Norman T L Chan: Development of e-Cheque usage in Hong Kong Speech by Mr Norman T L Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the Electronic Cheque (e-Cheque) service Launching Ceremony, Hong Kong, 11 December 2015. *      *      * Ms Helen Wong, Mr Allen Yeung, Mr Wong Kuen-fai, distinguished guests, media representatives:  1.  Welcome to the official launch of the Electronic Cheque (e-Cheque) service jointly organised by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. For the first phase of the e-Cheque service, nine banks have started offering the e-Cheque issuance service, while all banks in Hong Kong can already accept e-Cheques deposited by their customers. 2.  Traditional paper cheques have been widely used in Hong Kong, but there are limitations. For example, the payer must deliver a physical cheque to the payee, and the payee must also physically deposit the cheque at a bank. These steps involve quite some time. Besides, paper cheques consume a lot of paper and are not environmentally friendly. In view of this, the HKMA began work with the banking industry on developing the necessary infrastructure for the electronic form of cheque service three years ago. Benefits of e-Cheques 3.  As e-Cheques have a number of obvious benefits over their physical counterparts, I believe they will become a popular form of electronic payment soon. I.  The e-Cheque issuance and deposit service is available via Internet banking platforms and the Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited’s portal on a 24-hour basis. Bank customers can process an e-Cheque any time. II.  As physical boundaries and barriers are no more, both payers and payees can enjoy the e-Cheque service with the convenience of mobile phones or Internet banking platforms anywhere. III.  E-cheques are quick and easy to use. In just a few simple steps, the payer can issue an e-Cheque via an Internet banking platform. Upon receiving the e-Cheque,  Adopting a highly secure digital signature, e-Cheques remove the need for the payer’s handwritten signature as required with paper cheques, reducing the risk of forgery. V.  Unlike certain electronic payments or funds transfers, the payee does not need to disclose his bank account number to the payer in order to receive an e-Cheque payment, which means greater privacy protection. For those payees who have more than one account, he can also enjoy the flexibility of deciding which account to deposit an e-Cheque into. VI.  Corporates and institutions which issue a huge volume of paper cheques can save substantial sums on printing, processing and mailing those cheques. In Hong Kong, listed companies process over 2 million physical cheques each year for dividend payments. Both paper consumption and mailing costs can be reduced substantially each year if shareholders agree switchinig to e-Cheques to receive these payments. Looking forward 4.  The e-Cheque is only at the beginning of its development. The HKMA will continue to explore ways of expanding its application in two areas, namely: 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  I.  Cross-border transactions – we will explore with the Guangzhou and Shenzhen branches of The People’s Bank of China, and the Monetary Authority of Macao with a view to promoting the use and clearing of cross-border e-Cheques. II.  Development of e-commerce – we will explore with the banking industry the use of e-Cheques in supporting e-commerce portals. While offering an additional option of payment for online shoppers, e-Cheques can also increase the efficiency of e-commerce operations. Acknowledgments 5.  The launch of the e-Cheque reflects the continuous effort of banks in Hong Kong to provide a wide range of payment services. It also signifies the HKMA’s commitment in promoting the efficiency and modernisation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure. Besides, the smooth development and launch of the e-Cheque has benefited immensely from the great support of relevant government departments. I.  Firstly, amendments to the Electronic Transactions Ordinance were finalised by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer in early 2015, giving electronic cheques the same legal status as physical cheques. The Pay e-Cheque portal was also launched on 7 December, which allows the public to make payments of government bills and fees with e-Cheques. II.  The Inland Revenue Department became the first government department to participate in the Pay e-Cheque portal, providing a convenient and easy option for paying tax demand notes, business registration fees, and stamp duties as well as purchasing tax reserve certificates. III.  Lastly, the Treasury has also actively helped promote the acceptance by other government departments of e-Cheques in paying general demand notes. 6.  I would like to thank all those involved in bringing the e-Cheque service into fruition. The HKMA will strengthen public education programmes with the Hong Kong Association of Banks to increase public understanding of the use and benefits of e-Cheques. 7. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  François Villeroy de Galhau: Climate change – the financial sector and pathways to 2°C Speech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, at the Conference COP21, Paris, 30 November 2015. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,  This conference organised by the 2°C initiative, the Oxford Martin School and France Stratégie for the opening of the COP21, is a major event in which I am delighted to participate. I would like to make some comments on a topic that has steadily gained ground in the climate change agenda, namely the way central banks and prudential authorities take account of climate-related issues.  This is in fact a relatively new question. We were already committed as both citizens and public policy-makers, but monetary and prudential authorities are today concerned by three broad categories of risk:  – Direct physical risks, related to the increase in both the frequency and the magnitude of extreme climatic events, which raise questions in terms of insurance costs.  – Liability risks, related to the financial impacts stemming from compensation requests from those who have suffered loss or damage due to climate change.  – Macroeconomic risks related to the transition between two production models, which can result in disorderly adjustments in sectors too heavily exposed to global warming or that become unviable due to the governments’ climate change commitment.  In practice, we already observe some financial imbalances in carbon-intensive industries facing rising costs, disruptive technologies, and regulatory uncertainties.1 The market value of most carbon-intensive industries has already been impacted. And re-pricing may occur rapidly and abruptly.  What is less clear at present is how we should react to such a development since the horizon at which climate change risks materialise largely exceeds the traditional horizon of most economic agents, and notably financial players. This is what Mark Carney famously referred to as the “tragedy of the horizon”.2  We all agree that a higher carbon price would send the right economic signal. But we are aware of how difficult international decision-making is in this area. Given my responsibility, and while awaiting such decisions, the following questions thus arise: how to ensure that investors and financial intermediaries are aware of their actual exposure to risks? And how to prevent a misallocation of capital to carbon-intensive sectors or stranded assets?  To address these questions, I will start by stressing that, fortunately, the financial sector and civil society are already mobilised (I). Next, I will discuss the need for public intervention to ensure an alignment of interests (II).  I/ The financial sector and civil society are already mobilised.                                                  1  Cf. Moody’s, “Impact of carbon reduction policies is rising globally”, March 2015. 2  Mark Carney, “Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon – climate change and financial stability”, speech given at Lloyd’s of London, 29 September 2015. 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  This mobilisation, which has yielded progress, appears to have occurred in three main phases.  First, the major public financial institutions were at the forefront of this movement. This is the case for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the Caisse des Dépôts, with its subsidiary CDC-Climat. The European Investment Bank estimates that it currently grants 25% of its loans – over EUR 20 billion per year – to “green” projects.  Second, under the aegis of the United Nations, projects were launched such as the UNEP finance initiative, a partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme and 200 financial sector institutions, which make environmental sustainability a collective responsibility, share best practices and establish principles for green financing. Thanks to the Montreal climate change protocol, or to the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition, signatory investors commit to measuring and disclosing the carbon footprint of their portfolios. The objective is ambitious: reduce investment in carbon-intensive projects by several hundred billion dollars.  Lastly, financial institutions are now making more direct commitments. French banks and insurance companies have recently announced that they have withdrawn their support for the coal industry and increased their financing of renewable energies. Paris Europlace called for the creation of an energy transition fund, which would be invested in by French banks, insurers and asset management companies, and which could in turn invest EUR 10 billion by 2020, with a view to financing projects to improve energy efficiency or promote renewable energies. This is a commendable initiative.  II/ To best align these private initiatives with the fight against global warming, which is a public good, public intervention is nevertheless necessary.  For central banks or prudential authorities, three questions arise: that of financing –and interaction with monetary policy–, that of information – and of disclosure–, and lastly that of time horizons –and stress tests–.  1.  The question of financing: what interaction with monetary policy?  Climate change is likely to affect the price of goods and services. It has a direct impact on food prices. But it will also more generally affect growth and the allocation of resources. Against this backdrop, central banks should remain vigilant about, and possibly monitor the economic consequences of climate change. And monetary policy will have to play its role of contributing to a smoother rebalancing of price structures, in line with its price stability mandate.  Article 2 of the European System of Central Banks statute states: “Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community, with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community [economic activities, sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment…the raising of the standard of living and quality of life].  Some would like to go a step further, using the quantitative easing tool to help finance the energy transition, purchasing “green” assets, granting favourable treatment to green assets that are eligible as collateral, or setting up dedicated long-term facilities; the list of possibilities is long.  However, we must bear in mind the ultimate aim of monetary policy. It is designed to achieve macroeconomic objectives, not sector-specific goals. The underlying assumption for direct monetary policy intervention is that the central bank is better equipped than private agents to ensure an efficient allocation of resources. But it is not a given that central banks would have such an informational advantage. Quantitative easing therefore does not aim to promote some types of assets over others but merely to free up capacity to finance the economy. For instance, current monetary policy encourages investment in longer-term projects, with better returns than government bonds, such as infrastructures and energy transition. But with one prerequisite: prudential regulations must be consistent, which may require adaptations to the framework laid down by the Solvency II insurance Directive. I welcome a number of recent 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  proposals promoting infrastructures made by the European Commission, which are a step in the right direction.  2.  The information challenge: the role of disclosure  The potential risks posed by climate change to the financial sector are complex and we have only just started to understand them. The most urgent need is probably better information.  Much high-quality work has been carried out in recent years to improve disclosure on climate-related issues. The French act on energy transition, which was enacted on 17 August 2015, strengthens the requirements regarding the disclosure and management of environmental risks. Article 173 requires institutional investors to include environmental objectives in their annual reports, in particular the exposure to climate risks, by measuring the carbon footprint of the assets that they finance and the "green” share of these assets relative to a set of targets. The implementing decree of the act, which is currently being drafted, will specify the information concerned and its presentation.  From a broader perspective, we should aim at greater clarity: there are about 400 climate-related information disclosure schemes. Imposing requirements or formulating recommendations in terms of information disclosure can be a powerful instrument for ensuring market discipline, as long as the information is targeted and pertinent, as evidenced by a number of successful examples. At the international level, under the aegis of the Financial Stability Board, a first task force known as the "Enhanced Disclosure Task Force" and composed of sector representatives had already issued recommendations in 2012 to improve, simplify and focus the communication of systemically important banks on the nature of their risks. At the national level, the guide on the relevance, consistency and readability of financial statements published by the French financial markets Authority in July 2015 is another positive example.  Clarification is a challenge to be taken seriously. We have therefore decided, within the Financial Stability Board and with the support of the recent G20 in Antalya, to set up very shortly – by the beginning of 2016 – another dedicated task force (EDTF). Its work should be completed within one year in order to rapidly ensure the effective disclosure on climate risk. It will formulate recommendations for voluntary disclosure, according to harmonised and therefore comparable methods. This should enable stakeholders and the public to find out about the share of financial sector assets linked to carbon emissions and the sector’s exposure to climate risk.  3. The time horizon challenge: the gradual implementation of stress tests  Stress testing is an integral part of risk management by financial institutions. It is particularly developed in the insurance and reinsurance sectors. Modelling disaster risk and capital levels – as set out in Solvency II – takes into account some of the climate risks. But the current regulatory framework for banks somehow overlooks climate change as a source of risk. Yet this would be the way to handle the question of the time horizon. In this respect, the Act on energy transition provides for the submission by end-2016 of a report on the implementation of a scenario of stress tests representative of the climate risks for banks.  However, achieving this raises serious questions. Two approaches are possible. Either comprehensive stress testing, covering all risks and associated asset classes for financial institutions, which would allow supervisors to monitor the total exposure to climate risk. Or granular stress testing, focusing on assets that are more specifically exposed to climate risk, which would be more appropriate for analysing specific sectors and financing needs, such as the financing of the oil sector.  Whatever the approach chosen, the main challenge would be to take account of climate risks, either through economic estimates that we master – such as GDP observed under stress – or directly through climate variables – such as the rise in temperature – which would require 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  developing new methods and gathering new information. This, of course, would mean relying on expert judgment on these issues, in a context where financial institutions do not have enough experience to understand future risks. We will work on this with the ACPR and the public authorities concerned.  * * * Understanding and analysing climate risk is essential. The regulations currently being drawn up – the Act on energy transition and the work of the Financial Stability Board – on information disclosure are useful tools to ensure that the transition to a greener economy is active and therefore under control. These initiatives could also contribute to making market participants more aware of the need to use a discount rate that is more compatible with the transition to a greener economy. The Canfin-Grandjean report of June 2015 also includes many interesting avenues.  However, we must at the same time remain modest. We, the public authorities, do not know everything. And we cannot substitute ourselves for private players, whether financial or non-financial. We need to ensure that any new requirement provides the right incentives to financial institutions, gives a certain degree of flexibility to the authorities and does not create disincentives to make headway in the energy transition process.  Modest, adaptable, yet determined. Because there is a battle to be won and because the current market signals – overly low carbon prices and an overly short time horizon – are insufficient to ensure full mobilisation. There are a large number of private initiatives. But there is also a need for a public framework to ensure the general and lasting alignment of interests. We are determined to play a full part, from Basel to Paris and elsewhere. Thank you. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sayuri Shirai: Japan’s economic and price developments and monetary policy – underlying inflation trend and inflation expectations Speech by Ms Sayuri Shirai, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Shimane, 25 November 2015. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. I. Introduction Good morning. I feel honored to have an opportunity to meet with the local government officials and business representatives here today. Let me also express my sincere gratitude for your kind cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japan’s Matsue Branch. Today, I would like to talk about the Bank’s baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity and prices through fiscal 2017 as well as risks to the scenario, as described in the October 2015 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter the Outlook Report). Accordingly, I also will present and explain my views. II. Japan’s medium-term outlook for economic activity and risk assessment Let me begin with Japan’s economic activity. A. Outlook for economic activity In the Bank’s baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the projected growth rate for fiscal 2015 was revised considerably downward while the projections for fiscal 2016 and 2017 were more or less unchanged, compared with those in the July 2015 interim assessment. Nevertheless, domestic demand is likely to increase and exports are expected to continue increasing moderately on the back of the recovery in overseas economies. A virtuous cycle among production, income, and spending is likely to be maintained in the corporate and household sectors. Firms’ and households’ growth expectations and potential economic growth are also likely to rise moderately in line with continued accommodative financial conditions. In fiscal 2017, the rate of economic growth is likely to decelerate significantly – mainly due to the effects of the planned consumption tax hike and cyclical deceleration in business fixed investment – but is still likely to remain positive (Chart 1). My outlook for economic activity is somewhat lower than the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts: around 1 percent for fiscal 2015; a little less than around 1.5 percent for fiscal 2016; and slightly above 0 percent for fiscal 2017, owing to a significant decline in the growth rate, due, for example, to the planned consumption tax hike. Let me explain in some detail. For fiscal 2015, my projection is lower than that in the July 2015 interim assessment, reflecting the negative economic growth recorded in the April-June quarter (relative to the previous quarter), mediocre performance thereafter, and the prospect that such performance is likely to continue for the time being. Several factors comprise the background to this outlook. First, I adopted a more conservative projection of real exports, not only because external demand was temporarily weak, but also because more consideration was being given to the possibility that structural changes had been hampering rapid export recovery. The latter point is consistent with the fact that industrial production and exports by Japanese firms have remained sluggish while those by their 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  overseas subsidiaries have expanded rapidly since 2009.1 In particular, a shift to overseas production, mainly in the transportation machinery and electrical machinery sectors, left the Japanese economy with the general-purpose, production & business oriented machinery, and information & communication equipment sectors, etc. as the main engine for generating domestic production and export growth. The export performance of these leading sectors has been stagnant, mainly due to a deceleration in economic growth in Asia. Although real exports improved very recently, partly due to the release of new smartphones, they are likely to be more or less constant for the time being in light of the economic slowdown in emerging economies. Second, I revised downward my projection of real private consumption for fiscal 2015. Quarter-on-quarter growth rates for real consumption and real retail sales have turned positive in the July-September quarter. However, this downward revision was attributable to (1) very moderate real wage growth after turning positive in July this year and (2) stagnant developments in the consumer confidence index and its components over the next six months – including consumer perception indices on income growth and willingness to buy durable goods. Nevertheless, looking ahead, a moderate recovery trend in consumption is likely to be maintained as nominal wages will continue on a moderate rising trend, amid the tightening labor market conditions. Third, I revised downward my projection of business fixed investment for fiscal 2015 as well, owing to negative growth recorded in the April-June quarter (relative to the previous quarter). In contrast to positive business fixed investment plans for fiscal 2015 reported by the Bank’s Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), actual machinery orders and capital goods shipment have remained disappointing; some firms may postpone their fixed investment plans because of higher unexpected costs caused by labor shortages and rising prices of construction materials. One positive development, meanwhile, is a sustained recovery in residential investment. The recent problems related to the apartment construction wrongdoings in Yokohama and other related problems may dampen such investment temporarily. However, I continue to project a steady recovery in residential investment under the low interest rate environment, since a front-loaded increase in demand prior to the planned consumption tax hike will gradually materialize. For fiscal 2016, I am projecting relatively high economic growth owing to a front-loaded increase in private consumption and residential investment prior to the planned consumption tax hike, amid the favorable employment situation. However, I made a moderate downward revision compared with the July 2015 interim assessment, mainly due to lower-than-expected real export growth. My outlook is more cautious than the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts, probably because I allocate a greater weight to a potential loss of economic opportunities arising from labor shortages, resulting in a more moderate pace of economic growth. In Japan, firms with good business conditions tend to feel labor shortages and to be increasingly constrained from expanding business activities, while firms with bad business conditions tend to operate their businesses by managing existing employment. This may be one reason why the pace of replacing nonviable less active firms with viable active firms is slow, thereby hampering economic growth. B. Upside and downside risk assessment with regard to economic activity In the October 2015 Outlook Report, the Bank pointed out the following as risks to its baseline scenario for economic activity: (1) developments in overseas economies; (2) the effects of the planned consumption tax hike in April 2017; (3) firms’ and households’ medium- to long-term growth expectations; and (4) fiscal sustainability in the medium to long term. On the whole, it assessed that risks are skewed to the downside.                                                 1  See Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, “Global Shipment Index.” 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In my risk assessment related to economic activity, the upside and downside risks are likely to remain balanced through fiscal 2015 and 2016. By contrast, risks for fiscal 2017 are tilted to the downside. Particularly, I find the following risks related to overseas economies important: • In the Chinese economy, while the labor force population ratio declines, private consumption and Internet sales are firm, due in part to a continuing rise in wages. But the year-on-year rate of increase in retail sales for the first ten months of 2015 remains moderately below the annual target of 13 percent. The tertiary sector, i.e., services industries, is growing and already accounts for over 50 percent of the total value added of the economy. Whether the services industries could become an engine for domestic and global economic growth in the foreseeable future is yet to be seen and may incur downside risk, given that an increasing number of private-sector firms face uncertainty with respect to financing conditions amid the more cautious lending behavior of the banking sector. • Other Asian economies are expected to see stronger growth, led mainly by domestic demand, since the pace of trade growth through the global value chain has decelerated. However, the downside risk is that such developments in domestic demand could be contained by large-scale portfolio capital outflows and the amplified volatility in the foreign exchange and capital markets, perhaps as a result of the normalization of the U.S. monetary policy. • The U.S. economy may achieve greater-than-expected growth if business fixed investment and residential investment expand firmly in tandem with greater growth in labor productivity and wages. This is plausible given that the deleveraging process has made progress in the corporate and household sectors. • In the euro area, the fragmentation in interbank markets has improved and some cross-border capital flows have increased, partly owing to the accommodative monetary easing performed by the European Central Bank, thereby leading to an increase in lending to firms and households. In addition, the intra-regional competitiveness gap has shrunk as the wage growth rate per worker in Germany has been maintained at a high level, at around 3 percent, while wages in peripheral countries have been contained and adjusted. The upside risk is that these favorable developments may enable the euro area to generate stronger-than-expected economic recovery. In addition, for fiscal 2017, the downside risk is greater because there is considerable uncertainty at present related to subsequent declines in demand and in real income after the planned consumption tax hike. It is not clear how much these negative impacts could be offset by a “quantitative” expansion of public- and private-sector fixed investment associated with the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, amid the tightened labor market conditions. III. Japan’s medium-term outlook for prices and risk assessment Next, I will turn to the price outlook and risk assessment. A. Outlook for prices In the Bank’s baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the core consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food and excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes) is likely to be at around 0 percent for the time being, lower than that in the July 2015 interim assessment. After that, the rate of increase in the core CPI is projected to accelerate toward 2 percent as the underlying trend in inflation steadily rises and the effects of the decline in crude oil prices dissipate. Although the timing of reaching around 2 percent depends on developments in crude oil prices, this is projected to happen around the second half of fiscal 2016, assuming that crude oil prices will rise moderately from the recent 
   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  level. Thereafter, Japan’s economy is expected to gradually shift to a growth path that sustains such inflation in a stable manner (Chart 1). Regarding my outlook for prices, let me first present an overall picture. Although the mechanism of the price rises I assume is the same as that in the Bank’s baseline scenario, my projections remain more cautious than the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts. The outlook throughout fiscal 2017 was revised somewhat downward. Currently, my projection is that the rate of increase in the core CPI is likely to rise closer to around 2 percent “from the end of fiscal 2016 to early fiscal 2017” – a delay of about a quarter from my previous projection of “toward the end of fiscal 2016.” Let me explain my outlook in some detail. My projection for prices for fiscal 2015 is that the core CPI will be at around 0 percent. The slight downward revision from the July 2015 interim assessment is attributable to the decline in crude oil prices. Also, the delay in the pace of the output gap improvement was taken into account as the actual output gap deteriorated in the April-June quarter. My projection for fiscal 2016 that the core CPI inflation will rise to a little over 1 percent is rather cautious compared to that presented previously. This reflects (1) the remaining effects of the drop in energy prices, (2) a delay of about a quarter in terms of the timing for the output gap to turn positive, and (3) a delay in the timing for inflation expectations to begin rising owing to a slower pace of increase in prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase in the core CPI will accelerate and reach around 1.7–1.8 percent, or rise closer to around 2 percent from the January-March quarter of 2017 (the peak of the front-loaded increase in domestic demand) to the April-June quarter (the period most likely to see an opportunistic price increase with the planned consumption tax hike). My outlook for fiscal 2017 as a whole is that the average rate of core CPI inflation will decline somewhat and reach around a little over 1.5 percent – slightly below my July assessment – mainly due to the effects of the decline in demand following the front-loaded increase and a decline in real income. On the timing with respect to achieving sustained inflation of around 2 percent in a stable manner, it might be necessary to assess this over a little longer time span. This is because there is high uncertainty regarding the effects of the planned consumption tax hike and the “quantitative” expansion of public- and private-sector fixed investment associated with the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Moreover, it is likely to take some time for inflation expectations to rise. B. Upside and downside risk assessment with regard to prices With regard to risks to the Bank’s baseline scenario for prices, the Bank highlighted the following four factors: (1) developments in firms’ and households’ medium- to long-term inflation expectations; (2) developments in the output gap; (3) responsiveness of inflation to the output gap; and (4) developments in import prices. It assessed that risks are skewed to the downside. My risk assessment related to prices, on the other hand, is that risks for fiscal 2015 are balanced but those for fiscal 2016 and 2017 are tilted to the downside. In particular, there is a great deal of uncertainty related to crude oil prices and foreign exchange rate developments, which could generate both upside and downside risks to the price outlook. On the other hand, there is a downside risk that a steady increase in inflation expectations, a key factor in raising inflation in a stable manner, may not take place as fast as projected. On the whole, therefore, the risks are judged to be tilted to the downside. C. Expression on the timing with respect to achieving around 2 percent inflation In the baseline scenario described in the October 2015 Outlook Report, the Bank postponed the timing of reaching around 2 percent inflation by two quarters, from “around the first half of fiscal 2016” as described in the April Outlook Report to “around the second half of fiscal 2016.” On this front, I opposed the expression “around the first half of fiscal 2016” and proposed to change it to “in or around fiscal 2016” at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  on April 30. Meanwhile, at the MPM held on October 30, I supported the Bank’s revised expression. Let me explain why. Due to the fact that the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts was revised downward sharply this time, it is apparently unfeasible to achieve around 2 percent inflation around the first half of fiscal 2016. Therefore, it is reasonable for the Bank to change the expression. However, given that it assessed that risks to prices are skewed to the downside, it may be appropriate for the Bank to use an expression that allows for a wider time span to reach around 2 percent, such as “from around the second half of fiscal 2016 to around the first half of fiscal 2017” – instead of “around the second half of fiscal 2016.” On the other hand, the timing expressed as “around the second half of fiscal 2016” practically corresponds to the latter half of the intended period in my proposal in April. Also, more importantly, the expression is very similar to my present projection and could be regarded as more or less in line with it by interpreting “around 2 percent” flexibly. Based on these two reasons, I supported the Bank’s revised expression. IV. Conduct of monetary policy Despite the downward revision of the Bank’s outlook for economic activity and prices from the July 2015 interim assessment, I view that it is important for the Bank to maintain the accommodative monetary environment by continuing the current guideline for money market operations. Before I elaborate on my line of thinking, by making referrals in contrast to trends observed last October when the expansion of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) was implemented, let me emphasize that the price stability target of 2 percent does not just pursue a price hike; the target should be achieved with sustained wage growth and expansion of private consumption. On this front, it is important to assess whether Japan’s economy continues to face a virtuous cycle among production, income, and spending operating in both the corporate and household sectors. Let me highlight five viewpoints that are essential to making such an assessment. First, firms’ business conditions and current profits are more favorable than those in the previous year. For example, the Bank’s September 2015 Tankan indicates that the diffusion index (DI) for actual business conditions for all industries – calculated by subtracting the percentage share of firms responding that business conditions are “unfavorable” from the share of those indicating that business conditions are “favorable” – improved moderately from 7 percent in June to 8 percent in September, in contrast to a decline from 7 percent to 4 percent over the same period last year. In particular, the business conditions DI of large nonmanufacturing enterprises improved further from 23 percent in June to 25 percent in September – exceeding the levels of the previous year (dropping from 19 percent to 13 percent over the same period). Projected current profits are favorable as well. The September Tankan shows that the year-on-year rate of change in projected current profits of all industries for fiscal 2015 recorded 3.3 percent (4.0 percent in manufacturing and 2.7 percent in nonmanufacturing). The profitability outlook shows a complete change from that for fiscal 2014 reported in September last year, when the rate of change in projected profits was minus 4.0 percent (minus 2.6 percent in manufacturing and minus 5.1 percent in nonmanufacturing). Furthermore, let me plot the relationship between the year-on-year rate of growth in projected current profits and sales for all industries for fiscal 2015 as of September 2015 (Chart 2). This shows that a relatively large number of sectors are positioned in the first quadrant (positive territory for both growth in current profits and sales). Generally, growth in current profits is much greater than that in sales – reflecting an improvement in the terms of trade (caused by a plunge in commodity prices such as for crude oil) as well as profits from revaluation of dividends from overseas and higher yen-based export prices, both driven by the yen’s depreciation. Noticeable developments are that the rates of growth in current profits and sales in (1) food; (2) accommodations, eating & drinking services; and (3) services for individuals are greater than those for fiscal 2014 reported in September 2014. The food sector, which is 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  included in manufacturing, projects export sales growth of 5 percent and domestic sales growth of 3 percent – suggesting that domestic private consumption is quite solid as well. The aforementioned data indicate that domestic demand is recovering from the adverse effects of the consumption tax hike in April 2014. Second, a risk of returning to deflation is considered low given that prices of a wide range of consumption items, excluding energy, have been rising. While the Bank assesses the underlying trend in inflation based on various indicators, typical indicators are mainly the core CPI and trimmed mean. Both exclude temporarily volatile items in order to grasp the trend behavior of prices. They often are utilized to project future prices owing to their relatively high predictive power. The difference is that the core CPI always excludes the same items that tend to show high volatility from the consumption basket weight. In contrast, the trimmed mean looks at the price changes every month for each item of the CPI and eliminates a certain fraction (e.g., 10 percent) of the most extreme observations at both ends of the largest and smallest changes. Thus, items eliminated each month could vary month to month. The Bank uses the CPI for all items less fresh food, or the “core CPI,” in determining its medium-term outlook for prices in the Outlook Report. Energy prices are included in the core CPI because they did not have a statistically significant impact on CPI movements in the long term. However, as a sharp fall in energy prices since the latter half of the previous year has amplified the volatility in the core CPI, it has become more important to assess the underlying trend in inflation in a comprehensive manner, not only with the core CPI but also with multiple indicators. As one such indicator, the Bank has begun to release the “CPI for all items less fresh food and energy” on a monthly basis. While the rate of change in the core CPI has been at around 0 percent recently, that in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy has risen to 1.2 percent lately (Chart 3). Moreover, the trimmed mean is increasingly becoming important since the indicator automatically removes highly volatile items every month – given that fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates have amplified. The “10 percent trimmed mean” has been rising moderately and is currently at 0.6 percent, and this contrasts sharply with the declining trend observed about the same period last year. Third, firms’ pricing behavior with respect to sales prices has shown positive developments. To see this, let me plot the relationship between the actual sales price DI and the rate of growth in projected domestic sales for fiscal 2015, according to the September Tankan (Chart 4). The sales price DI is calculated by subtracting the percentage share of firms responding that their sales prices are “falling” from the share of those indicating that the prices are “rising.” Chart 4 indicates that a few sectors are positioned in the first quadrant (positive territory for both the actual sales price DI and projected domestic sales). Developments in sectors such as (1) food and (2) accommodations, eating & drinking services are worthy of note. The sales price DI in these sectors used to be negative to a relatively large degree or showed greater responses with “fall” than those with “rise” before QQE was launched. This indicates a significant turnaround in firms’ pricing behavior toward an environment where they find it easier to raise their sales prices than before. The current rise in a wide range of CPI items reflects three factors: (a) an import price rise driven by the yen’s depreciation; (b) an increase in domestic demand; and (c) a pass-through of a wage rise. While it is difficult to disentangle these factors, the impact of (a) above, the import price rise, seems large and it eventually will fade away unless a further depreciation of the yen takes place. Meanwhile, firms have provided high value-added goods and services, and higher sales prices have accompanied a sales increase in some items, as seen in the food and accommodations, eating & drinking services sectors. Looking ahead, nominal wages are likely to rise and the output gap is likely to improve in positive territory, which will help enhance the sustainability of a price rise. Fourth, developments in inflation expectations should be monitored closely, although some indicators have declined recently. Inflation expectations are a collective term referring to those of households, firms, and economists, as well as market-based indicators. Attention should be 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  paid to a recent decline in inflation expectations of firms and economists, as well as in market-based indicators. At the same time, however, a decline in inflation expectations has been a global phenomenon since summer 2015. Therefore, it is important to understand whether such a decline reflects a downward revision of commodity price projections and a temporary deceleration in global economic growth, or alternatively a deterioration of the outlook for the domestic supply-demand balance. On this front, domestic private consumption has been resilient. The corporate sector has maintained its positive business fixed investment plans according to various recent surveys, and thus fixed investment is likely to expand in the near future. These domestic demand conditions support the view that domestic supply-demand balance is not bad at all. Inflation expectations, therefore, are likely to show a sustainable rise once the rate of change in the CPI begins to rise following an improvement in the output gap. Fifth, as a related issue, households’ inflation expectations tend to be higher than those of firms. Households tend to perceive that prices are always rising and they always keep positive inflation expectations even under a mild deflationary phase or a very slight inflationary phase (Chart 5). This suggests the presence of an upward bias in inflation expectations. On this point, I have delivered several speeches abroad in the past and have suggested that the scale of upward bias appears to be generally greater in Japan than in Europe and the United States.2 Given the past long-standing stagnant wages, households appear to have formed an expectation over time that future wages will always decline. This has led households to anticipate tighter budgets, and such strong defensive action has resulted in a larger upward bias in their inflation expectations. In this environment, it is important for households to form a perception that wages will increase steadily and that such an increase will continue; indeed, wages are currently improving moderately. In addition, at present, a further monetary policy action is unnecessary given that current sluggish movements of the core CPI caused by a decline in energy prices are temporary, and that a decline in production costs and the resultant improvement in corporate profits might enhance the opportunity for firms to raise wages more readily. Based on these five viewpoints, it is time to closely monitor whether prices will exhibit a rising trend under the current accommodative monetary easing environment. If such a path toward price rises does not materialize at all, the Bank – depending on the causes – may consider some adjustments with regard to the monetary policy. This brings me to the end of my speech. Thank you very much indeed for your kind attention.                                                  2  For recent speeches, see Sayuri Shirai, “Monetary Policies in a Diversifying Global Economy: Japan, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific Region,” Remarks at the Panel Discussion Organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Bank of Japan, 2015, and Sayuri Shirai, “Unconventional Monetary Policies of the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank,” Remarks at the Panel Discussion at the Bruegel Annual Meeting, Bank of Japan, 2015.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Karnit Flug: Increasing competition in the financial system to benefit the Israeli economy Remarks by Dr Karnit Flug, Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the presentation of the Strum Committee Report to the Minister of Finance and to the Governor, Tel Aviv, 14 December 2015. *      *      * I would like to thank the Committee’s members and its chairperson for their comprehensive and professional work in recent months. The Bank of Israel sees extreme importance in increasing competition in the banking system in particular and in the financial system in general, and toward that end is promoting a series of processes, some in collaboration with the other regulators, in addition to the recommendations discussed here today: • Establishing a credit data register, which will reduce information asymmetries between banks and nonbank credit providers and will provide the customer with negotiating power; • Promoting a securitization market, which will allow an increase in the sources of credit and provide a bridge between the capital held by institutional investors and the credit needs of the economy; • Extended implementation of the vast majority of recommendations by the Zaken Committee to promote competition. The Bank of Israel supports every process that serves the public, and takes this principle into account in every decision it reaches. Therefore, the issues must be examined from a long term perspective, and processes whose negative impact is greater than their benefit and that are liable to pose a risk to the economy should be avoided. We will thus ensure that the reform will bring about the intended changes. There is broad agreement on the need to strengthen the competition in the credit market’s household and small businesses segment, and to make it easier for new participants to compete in the merchant acquiring and payment services sector as well. The Committee proposes ways to increase the number of participants, to create conditions that will increase competition between participants, to increase the sources available to them, and to ease the connection to the payment and settlement systems. During the formulation of these processes, there is utmost importance to ensuring the protection of financial services consumers, and the stability of new entities, which of course impacts on the stability of the entire system. We must not forget the lessons of the most severe financial crisis in our generation, which was caused by irresponsible measures and inadequate supervision. It is important to remember that in the past three years the balance of consumer credit has increased cumulatively by about 20 percent, and credit to small businesses by about 30 percent. As noted, the report contains very significant steps, which will change the state of financial system competition, and agreement has been reached regarding those steps. However, there are quite a few steps regarding which there is still disagreement, such that the discussions have not yet been exhausted and there remains much work ahead of the formulation of final recommendations. I emphasize that the issues which the Bank of Israel opposes reflect, from the Bank’s professional perspective, measures that are liable to negatively impact the public and to serve as a marked risk to the stability of the economy. The Committee’s recommendations reflect agreements that were reached on important and material issues: 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Separating the two credit card companies from the large banks, while providing proportionate protection to the nascent separated companies; A more lenient level of supervision over entities that do not take deposits, which will make it easier for new entities to compete with banks; Constructing technological tools for the consumer (information services and activity initiation) that will allow simple price comparison; Deposit insurance is a measure that will help small banks compete for additional customers, and strengthen our ability to deal with the next crisis; Completing regulation that will apply to nonbank financing companies (including P2P’s). Supervised companies will be able to be connected to the payment systems. Payment services regulation, in accordance with generally accepted principles worldwide with adjustment for the domestic market, and the setting of conditions for access to the controlled payment systems. Setting up a committee to monitor the implementation of the recommendations, and to recommend, as necessary, additional steps. Advancing the steps on which agreement has been reached will lead to a material change in the level of competition in the financial system, without risking its stability and without negatively impacting consumers. It is important that financial system reforms are made with agreement, as a lack of agreement will hamper the ability to implement the recommendations in practice. We must implement these steps responsibly, with a long term view of the benefit to consumers and the economy. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Interview in Handelsblatt Interview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in Handelsblatt, conducted by Mr Jan Mallien and Mr Daniel Schäfer and published on 10 December 2015. *      *      * Mr Praet, rather than the next big flood of money that was expected from the European Central Bank (ECB), there was only a very small expansion of the existing stimulus. Did you have to back down? Does the majority of the ECB’s Governing Council no longer support your and Mario Draghi’s policy? Quite the opposite: we had a very strong majority! By way of explanation: the relevant working groups provide the Executive Board with an analysis of the different measures and the Board discusses a monetary policy package, which I then put forward to the Governing Council. What was agreed last week is exactly in line with what I proposed to the Council on Thursday, taking into account what was discussed in the committees. You had already met the other members of the ECB’s Governing Council for dinner on Wednesday though. Did you encounter so much resistance then that you scaled back your proposals before Thursday’s meeting? The dinner always takes place, but these issues are not discussed during the meal. It is true that at first I was not sure how the proposals would be received. But in the end, the discussion was not very controversial. Not everyone was in favour of my proposals, but it is not the case that we said “we want this”, and then got less. That is just not true. If you didn’t want to achieve anything more, why did you create such high expectations beforehand? We had already talked about reviewing our measures when the Governing Council met in Malta in October. The markets already reacted to this back then, which was understandable. The problem was that the markets’ expectations grew ever bigger in the meantime and were persisting, even though the most recent economic data had been encouraging. One big problem was that, during the quiet period... ...i.e. the days directly before the Governing Council meeting, when members of the Council are not allowed to talk about monetary policy... ...during this period, the markets exaggerated the situation again. But we could not respond to it because we are obliged to remain silent. What do you mean by “exaggerated”? That there was speculation about a package of measures that had never been up for discussion. But prior to the start of the quiet period you and Mario Draghi gave pretty hard-hitting speeches which made the markets feel euphoric. Why didn’t you quickly try to correct expectations? You shouldn’t push expectations management too far. If expectations get out of control, we, as the central bank, will try to correct it. But that simply cannot be done during the quiet period. What are the consequences of this communications debacle? We don’t communicate in order to please the markets, but to fulfil our mandate. Investors seem to have taken a different view. To begin with, the market expected a reduction in the deposit rate, an increase in the amount of monthly bond purchases and an extension of the bond-buying programme. But what was 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  not anticipated at all was the reinvestment of maturing bonds or the expansion of the programme to include regional bonds. The reinvestment of maturing bonds is an important decision because it ensures enough liquidity is available for as long as is necessary. The expansion to include regional bonds is also important because the markets were concerned that, in some instances in the foreseeable future, there might not be enough bonds to purchase. But is that enough to get inflation moving back towards 2%? Firstly, when it comes to our inflation objective, I’m really determined. I’m a hardliner on this point. And we as the ECB are ensuring that the necessary degree of monetary policy easing will be maintained in order to achieve the goal. But there are two big uncertainties: developments in the emerging countries and the effects of the interest rate turnaround in the US. As regards the emerging countries, we have arrived at the third phase of the great financial crisis. It started in the US, continued in the euro area and now it has reached the emerging economies. It’ll take a long time to overcome. I would not be so concerned about this if the position of the euro area were more robust, but unfortunately it is still very fragile. And what risks do you see in the US? We don’t comment on the monetary policy of other central banks. But the markets still don’t know what the effects of the imminent turnaround in US monetary policy will be on long-term interest rates and global bond markets. It obviously brings uncertainty. Are you ready, if need be, to do more, and what would be your preferred instruments? We have clearly said that we are ready to do more, if this became necessary. The precise choice of instruments cannot be determined long in advance; it is based on the specific circumstances. The asset purchase programme is sufficiently flexible for its size, composition and duration to be adapted if necessary. You have been pumping in money since March with large-scale purchases of government bonds. Nevertheless, inflation in November only stood at around 0.1%. Doesn’t that prove that your policy isn’t working? No, it’s working very well. In fact we were pleased to see how strongly our monetary policy has improved credit conditions. The impact on inflation however seems to be taking longer. Some would say that greater patience is called for. We have already pushed back several times our expectations of when the inflation rate will reach just under 2%. If we keep pushing them back, credibility will be put at risk. Is this view shared by other members of the Governing Council? Almost everyone on the ECB’s Governing Council thinks that the measures are working. But that doesn’t mean that everyone finds them good. There are two schools of thought among the critics on the Council. Some say they’re unnecessary because the economic situation isn’t that bad at all. For instance, they don’t regard the development in inflation expectations as being so dramatic. Others say that, because of the special nature of a currency union, such asset purchases should only be used if we are in a deflationary situation. This point can be discussed at length. A large majority of the Council members, which includes me, think that if you deal with that only in the extreme circumstances of deflation then it’s too late. It can only be corrected, the thinking goes, with great difficulty and requires much more effort. But doesn’t the ultra-loose monetary policy reduce the pressure on policymakers to undertake reforms? I am of course concerned about the rather hesitant pace of economic policy reform. Many politicians are afraid of alarming the voters. That’s why they drag out reforms. Monetary policy cannot solve the problems. But we cannot be inactive either, simply because the other side does not deliver. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  You have often used market-based inflation expectations to argue for monetary easing. Are markets still a useful source of information for monetary policy? I never take only one indicator. And we don’t conduct monetary policy on the basis of market prices. That is only one part of the information we look at. Even when there’s no news, the markets are still subject to a lot of volatility anyway. A number of German politicians have recently voiced strong criticism of a secret agreement on the purchase of securities by the national central banks. Some of those banks have purchased on a large scale, others not. Why is there this difference? There’s no secret agreement. When the currency union was founded governments decided to transfer functions and tasks that are necessary for monetary policy to the Eurosystem and to leave other tasks as the responsibility of the national central banks. They invest, for instance, to cover the pensions of their employees or to build up capital and reserves. Some central banks also manage the investment portfolios of other central banks outside the euro area and invest this money so that it stays in circulation. It’s vital that the Governing Council of the ECB is in full control of the size of the Eurosystem balance sheet, and that is the case. If that’s the case, why not do it publicly? Personally, I see no problem in being more transparent on this matter. But the decision has to be taken by the Governing Council. Could the ECB force the national central banks to do that? As I said, the national central banks fulfil some of their tasks under their own responsibility and at their own risk, as provided for in the European treaties. But aren’t these purchases monetary financing? No, the ECB’s Governing Council limits the overall amount and has the necessary information. There is no such thing as “money printing by national central banks” outside of the Eurosystem framework. In any case, the Governing Council ensures that no Eurosystem operations infringe the prohibition of monetary financing. Mr Praet, you were born in Germany and grew up here. Do you understand why the ECB’s policy is being so severely criticised here? The situation in Germany is different from elsewhere in Europe. There has been no credit cycle here. But in Germany it’s often forgotten that we would have faced a catastrophic situation if we had not acted. The European environment is very difficult. We have institutional weaknesses in the euro area which have to be addressed and eliminated. Until this happens, the work we have as a central bank will be more difficult than is the case in other currency areas. There is no proper resolution system for banks, and nothing in the event a state runs into difficulties. It’s not about us favouring one country over another. It is simply about making the best of a difficult situation. What we have done is right. It’s the best we could do, and it has been working. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Interview in La Libre Belgique Interview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in La Libre Belgique, conducted by Ms Isabelle de Laminne and Mr Vincent Slits and published on 21 December 2015. *      *      * What is the situation in the euro area on the eve of 2016? How do you see the coming years? The economic outlook has improved, in an environment where interest rates are low and oil prices have fallen sharply. The positive effects of the structural reforms in a number of countries, such as Spain and Ireland, should also be underscored. These factors have had positive effects on the labour market and on the economic recovery. Fiscal policies will be more neutral too, even slightly expansionary. In fact, they will contribute 0.1% to GDP growth in the euro area in 2016 and 2017. Enormous fiscal efforts have been made, although debt levels are still too high. However, we must bear in mind that real GDP in the euro area in the first quarter of 2016 will barely return to its level of early 2008. This means that over the last eight years the GDP of the euro area has not grown in real terms, on average, even though countries like Germany saw reasonable growth. Other countries have experienced a severe fall in their living standards for a very long period of time. This poses a number of problems. The damage caused by a period of non-growth, with two recessions, is considerable. There is, of course, structural unemployment, but business investment also declined considerably during this period and has still not regained its 2008 level. Countries have also cut back sharply on infrastructure investment. And has the financial sector stabilised now? The financial sector is on a firmer footing. It has largely been recapitalised. Banking supervision is now carried out at European Central Bank level, and that is a very positive development. But pockets of fragility still exist, for example the level of non-performing loans in some countries. Provisions have been made for these debts, but they are an element of fragility nonetheless. The low profitability of some banks and the level of public sector debt, which is still significant, should also be underscored. Before the crisis, public debt in the euro area represented 60% of GDP, but today it stands at nearly 100%. To conclude, the economic situation in the euro area is improving but remains difficult. The main challenge for the euro area will be to demonstrate its ability to bring prosperity and security. An enormous amount of work remains to be done. To this must be added the political risks of what I call “seeping pessimism”. There is still considerable support for the euro but at the political level greater European integration is still rejected to some extent. That is one of the risks for the coming years. The crisis has highlighted not the weaknesses of monetary union, but the weaknesses of an incomplete monetary union. The ECB often sends out the message that it can create the conditions for stronger growth but that governments must, in turn, undertake structural reforms to make their economies more competitive. Do the politicians expect too much from the ECB? Yes and no. No, because everyone responsible must take action. This is not a great coordinated plan. We need a mix. A mix that includes, on the one hand, a policy of structural reforms to stimulate supply in the economy, and support for demand led by the ECB, and, on the other, fiscal 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  policies to achieve both debt sustainability and long-term growth. Cuts affecting public infrastructure should be avoided, for example; they are not good for long-term growth. The principal challenge for governments is to regain the road to productivity, a source of prosperity. If you look back to 2000 and the outlook for growth for the following five years, an average growth rate of 2.4% was expected. In 2015 the growth prospects for the next five years are no higher than 1.3% annually. This problem also affects Japan, the United States and the emerging countries. Productivity gains are limited to certain technology sectors. They need to be rolled out to the rest of society, the health sector for example, or to tax collection. Overall, productivity gains have slowed with respect to previous decades. The priority in structural reform must be the rapid dissemination of these technological advances throughout society. And yes, because people expect too much from the ECB, if other actors rein in their efforts whenever we take action. We are seeing less of an effort on the public finance side. The ECB made it possible to avoid an outright depression in 2012 and 2013, and even the break-up of the euro. It will pursue an accommodative monetary policy for as long as is necessary. Without giving a date, this timescale is fairly long. It’s a long lasting endeavour. Additional risks have arisen from the slowdown in the emerging countries, risks that are pretty significant for the euro area. There are also downward pressures on prices in the manufacturing sector as a result of surplus output and the very high unemployment level. But monetary policy alone will not solve all the problems. Is the situation in Greece under control now? Discussions are ongoing and are still intensive at the political and technical levels, but the will to succeed is there and the atmosphere of the discussions has improved considerably. It is distinctly more positive than it was at the beginning of the year. A great deal of progress has already been made through these negotiations. Significant reforms have been voted in. The banks will be able to be recapitalised. Nevertheless, the situation remains very fragile in this country. After the debt crisis, isn’t the migration crisis the next threat to European cohesion? Or does it represent more of an opportunity? Europe must show that it is a prosperous and secure area. In the short term migration will have an economic impact in the form of a fiscal expansion with some positive impact on growth. Germany’s fiscal situation is likely to deteriorate by around 0.3% to 0.4% of GDP in 2016 and 2017. This deterioration will be weaker in other countries. In the long term we will also have to look at the impact of the refugee crisis. This population is different, and care will have to be taken in integrating the migrants into the labour market, especially in Germany. In the medium term, from a demographic point of view, it can be a positive factor. The key issue is that of integrating migrants into the labour market in line with their profiles. All of these economic aspects are known and straightforward. From an economic perspective, this situation is not insurmountable; it is above all a political issue. The more integration we achieve at the economic level, the more it will be accepted politically. But all of this cannot be done in a day. Europe needs a young and well-trained workforce. We can create an opportunity out of a tragic situation, but it is not going to be easy. It is possible for a country to organise migration, and we have already done so in the past. The issue of security to combat the threat of terrorism will become a major challenge for governments in the months to come. France has already said that it will take a few liberties with the European deficit limits. Shouldn’t the fiscal straightjacket on Member States be loosened? This has been a little bit overstated, because the security figures are quite low in the budgets, and it is not prohibitively expensive to strengthen security. Of course, it is relevant from a fiscal 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  point of view, but the amounts are not very high. By contrast, if we include the cost of national defence under security, then the figures are potentially higher. However, it should be emphasised that this is not the source of France’s fiscal woes: it also has a well-known structural problem. How can we counter the surge in nationalist and populist currents in Europe from an economic perspective? By delivering the prosperity and economic security that was promised when we created the euro area. Today, we have the same level of economic output as we had eight years ago. The crisis caused significant economic and social pain, notably in the countries that experienced a drop in their living standards. Inequality has risen as a result of unemployment. This is unacceptable socially and has political consequences. There is no obvious willingness to integrate the euro area further. We are at a turning point. Integration at the financial level is progressing, but the European project as a whole needs to be further deepened. We must resist the temptation to go into reverse; we shouldn’t agree to stand still: we must forge ahead towards more integration. As a central banker, I am more of an observer than an actor in this area. Monetary policy is only one part of this. But even the harshest critics acknowledge that the ECB is an institution that functions well and has the capacity to take decisions and to avoid catastrophes. The same effectiveness would be required at the political level, even if, admittedly, it is more difficult. And, as I said earlier, the crisis did not reveal the weaknesses of monetary union, but rather the weaknesses of an incomplete monetary union. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Carolyn Wilkins: Innovation, central-bank style Remarks by Ms Carolyn Wilkins, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the Rotman School of Management and Munk School of Global Affairs, Toronto, Ontario, 13 November 2015. *      *      * I’d like to thank Ron Morrow, Alexis Corbett, Jill Vardy and Michael Ehrmann for their help in preparing this speech. Introduction Everyone here knows that companies must innovate to thrive. You may not know that the same is true for central banks, even if we’re the one kind of bank you wouldn’t imagine going out of business. Just like private companies, central banks are often focused on immediate issues. This is hardly surprising, given what has been thrown our way these past few years: a financial crisis, the Great Recession and then the oil price shock. And a central bank exists in the first place to set a solid foundation for the economy and the financial system. In recent years, we’ve kept inflation low and stable. This has made it easier for people and companies to recover from the downturn. Working with other authorities, we also avoided major disruptions in our financial system. Given this track record, why does innovation matter to the Bank? It matters because the world is moving quickly: who would have imagined 20 years ago that interest rates would be below zero in a number of advanced economies? That Canadian-dollar assets would be held as foreign reserves? Or that there would be a Bitcoin ATM in your local pub? Confident as we are in how we do things now, the Bank keeps its eyes on the future. Failing to do so would be a mistake for our business and could have real negative consequences for the Canadian economy. So, for us, innovation isn’t just about reacting to the most recent crisis; it’s about pushing ourselves so we’re ready for whatever the future holds. This is why I’m happy to be here this morning. The Rotman School of Management and the Munk School of Global Affairs are world-leading organizations. People here are passionate about innovation. Now, students here know that to stay ahead of the curve, you need a plan. We have a three-year plan that we’re putting in place, and that’s what I want to discuss today.1  I’ll start by talking about how our plan continues our tradition of innovating by questioning the answers. I’ll then go over some of the tough policy and research issues that we’ll have to tackle and that motivated us to create this plan.2 This will lead me to explain how we’ll get past the obstacles to new ideas by changing our corporate culture. Finally, I’m going to ask                                                  1  Every three years, the Bank sets a strategic course for the medium term. Our current plan, which was adopted in June, is outlined in the Bank of Canada’s 2016–18 Medium-Term Plan and can be found at http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/central-banking-new-era-mtp-2016–18.pdf. 2  Not surprisingly, the Bank’s strategy was built by answering questions similar to those proposed by former Rotman Dean Roger Martin in his book with A. G. Lafley, Playing to Win: What is the Bank hoping to achieve? What areas will it focus on? How will we get better results in these areas? What tools do we need to get there? What does the Bank’s senior management need to do to support our strategy? 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  you – and all the people who care about what the Bank does – to get involved in a constructive dialogue. Questioning the answers The Bank of Canada was itself an innovation when it was created during the Great Depression to support the economic and financial well-being of Canadians. Over the past 80 years, the Bank has done exactly that by carrying out four main lines of business. You know about our monetary policy role, because you read about how we set interest rates to return the economy to its potential and meet our inflation target of 2 per cent. In our financial stability role, we monitor the health of the Canadian financial system and act as the lender of last resort. One example of this work is the extraordinary liquidity that we provided to the system during the 2008 crisis. We’re also the federal government’s fiscal agent, which means that we manage about $650 billion in federal debt and around $70 billion in foreign reserves. Finally, we’re responsible for the bank notes in your wallet. More work goes into them than might be evident: developing new security features, combating counterfeiting and researching new trends in electronic payments and digital currencies. Those responsibilities, combined with a balance sheet of nearly $100 billion, put the Bank at the heart of the Canadian financial system. Even though the Bank has had the same mandate for 80 years, we haven’t been afraid to change our paradigm when circumstances demanded it. The change in monetary policy is stark. Under the Bretton Woods system that prevailed after the Second World War, the U.S. dollar could be exchanged for gold at a rate of $35 per ounce, and other countries pegged their currencies to the greenback. In 1950, Canada was a bit of an international rebel when it became the first industrialized country to adopt a floating exchange rate. Canada returned to a fixed peg in the 1960s, before letting the dollar float for good in 1970. Believe it or not, letting markets determine the value of a currency was revolutionary at the time. That didn’t solve all our problems, to say the least. Inflation became rampant: for a stretch of more than 20 years, it never fell below 2 per cent and sometimes exceeded 10 per cent. Interest rates exploded: for a few months in the 1980s, homeowners paid more than 20 per cent on a 5-year mortgage. The Bank had to react. Its leaders knew this and researched alternative monetary policy regimes. In central banking, just as in business, it can take a long time to bring an idea to market; it took about a decade to develop the inflation-targeting regime that we adopted in 1991. Targeting inflation seems like an obvious choice today, now that it’s been replicated in all major advanced economies. When we started studying it, however, many economists would have told you that it was unworkable. Not afraid to innovate, we were the second central bank in the world to set an inflation target, a few short months after New Zealand. It was a few years before the idea of targeting inflation was fully accepted by the Canadian public, and the Bank took a lot of heat for it. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  These days, most central bankers see inflation targeting as a success. It is credited with contributing to the “Great Moderation” – the 25 years or so before the financial crisis, when the performance of advanced economies was unusually good.3  I wish I could say that was the end of the story. In reality, this success probably distracted central banks from confronting the hard questions about the buildup of financial risks that led to the global crisis.4 It’s a stern reminder that we must resist confirmation bias and complacency. If the Bank’s history teaches anything, it’s that we must always be ready to consider questions that challenge our old answers. How do we do that? By giving innovative thinking a central place in our strategic plan and by creating a corporate culture that fosters different perspectives and challenges the status quo. As former Governor David Dodge once said to Bank staff, “we can have clashes of ideas secure in the knowledge that there are no winners or losers … what we’re doing is exploring all aspects of an issue.”5  Focusing on critical central bank issues Let me turn to what’s in our plan. The Bank of Canada remains committed to inflation targeting and to the expert execution of all of its responsibilities. The Bank is also committed to exploring how best to contribute to the Canadian economy in a world that is going through fundamental structural change. It’s in this context that the Bank is seeking to advance the frontiers along all its business lines. Let me focus on monetary policy. The current inflation-targeting framework is working well, so the bar for change is high. But history tells us we can’t cling indefinitely to a particular way of doing business. One important challenge for central banks now is that conventional monetary policy is stretched to its limits in some countries, where policy interest rates are at, or below, zero. Because of this, a number of countries are using innovative monetary policy measures to return inflation to target. Canada was fortunate to avoid the worst of the crisis, thanks to the relative strength of our economy, our prudently managed and resilient financial system, and well-anchored inflation expectations. Tiff Macklem, my predecessor and your dean, can take a lot of credit for that. It’s not surprising that we are focusing our research firepower on the monetary policy lessons from the crisis. The first lesson is that we have to be innovative with the instruments we have in our monetary policy toolbox. Structural changes have reduced the economy’s potential to grow without creating inflation, so the neutral rate of interest is lower than it was before the crisis.6 That means that, if we continue to target a 2 per cent inflation rate, it’s more likely that policy interest rates will fall to zero than in the past. Remember, only a few years ago, many believed zero was where monetary policy was out of bullets. We now observe that some European countries have tested this limit. There, central banks are charging commercial banks for their deposits, and governments are effectively getting paid to borrow. We published today an interesting staff paper that looks at the                                                  3  L. Benati and P.

   4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  experience of negative nominal interest rates in a number of countries, such as Denmark and Switzerland.7 It finds that the cost of securely storing cash is the main constraint on how low rates can go in these countries. It’s too early to tell how effective negative rates are at creating additional demand. However, it seems that, in the experience of these countries, the exchange rate channel might be particularly important. Our staff, along with many other central bank researchers and academics, are also assessing how effective other innovative monetary policy measures have been. Today, we are publishing other staff research papers that cover some of these issues. The Bank of Canada was one of the innovators when we used a tool called forward guidance. That’s when central banks communicate their intentions on the path of the policy rate or other policy actions. The evidence suggests that forward guidance, when it is clearly communicated and credible, can be an effective policy tool.8 It probably works best when it’s reinforced by other policy actions. Other innovative tools central banks have experimented with to ease monetary conditions are different kinds of asset-purchase programs. We studied the experience of the United States, Europe and other places, like Japan. These central banks designed their purchases based on the part of the market they most wanted to affect. To lower yields further out the curve, they purchased longer-term government bonds.9 To improve credit conditions in specific areas, they bought distressed assets such as corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Our research found that these purchases were successful in affecting yields.10  Research in this area will continue, at the Bank and around the world, because the situation continues to unfold and it will take years to understand all the effects of these innovations. The second lesson from the crisis is that policy-makers must consider the risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system when setting monetary policy. In the lead-up to the crisis, the world economy was bolstered by financial tailwinds that were poorly understood. In its aftermath, the global recovery is being held back by financial headwinds that we also don’t understand well. To address this blind spot, the Bank is making a big investment in economic modelling and research. Economists use theoretical and statistical models to forecast the future and study different policy scenarios. A good model allows us to isolate the cause-and-effect relationships at play in a complex system. Our workhorse models, such as the Terms-of-Trade Economic Model, do a good job of assessing the impact of economic shocks.11 But they can’t handle the behaviours and market disruptions that give rise to financial crises. So this is an area where we are pushing the frontiers.                                                  7  H.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  It’s a big challenge to integrate the financial sector and its interactions with the economy in our models in a realistic way. It’s even more difficult when you consider the fact that finance is being transformed by technological and social trends, as well as post-crisis regulatory reforms. This effort will yield a big payoff to public policy. Our models will inform the discussion with our federal partners on the right mix of policies – monetary, fiscal or macroprudential – that authorities should use to handle a specific problem and support the economic and financial well-being of Canadians. We need to understand better under what circumstances it would be appropriate for the Bank to use monetary policy for financial stability purposes. Models are just the starting point. No model can give the whole picture. That’s why we engage with the outside world to gather some of the missing pieces, here and abroad. This allows us to ask the right questions and apply our judgment. Considering alternative futures Innovation doesn’t stop with simply adapting our theoretical frameworks and gathering information on the world as we see it today. We must also challenge our thinking by contemplating alternative futures. The international monetary system could look completely different 20 years from now. China is increasingly opening its financial markets and liberalizing capital flows with the rest of world. While this is clearly positive for the global economy in the long run, this is a huge change and the transition could be bumpy at times. That means we need to think about how the world financial system will evolve and what Canada’s place in it will be. Will the renminbi become a reserve currency? How would that affect the demand for other reserve currencies, including Canadian-dollar assets? Global and domestic payment systems – the backbone of the financial system – could also look completely different. Technology is advancing and new players like PayPal and Apple Pay are competing with the traditional ones. The Bank will help lay the groundwork for the next generation of Canada’s payment systems.12  Then there are disruptive technologies, such as the distributed ledger that’s at the heart of Bitcoin, or peer-to-peer lending facilities like the Lending Club. These developments are pushing more and more financial activity outside the traditional financial sector. The sharing economy is upending entire industries. Here, I’m thinking about things like peer-to-peer home rental services such as VRBO and mediated services such as Uber. These types of trends raise questions for the Bank. Consider a cashless society where everyone uses e-money, which is monetary value stored electronically and not linked to a bank account. If this money were denominated in Canadian dollars, who should issue it? Who should earn the seigniorage?13 The central bank, as it does today, or the private sector? What would the financial system look like in each case? The Bank needs to consider all these questions. Cash is a public good that many people still prefer, especially for smaller transactions.14  As we think about alternative futures, we have to envision a world in which people mostly use e-money, perhaps even one that’s not denominated in a national currency, such as Bitcoin.                                                  12  J.

Pérez Saiz, “Public Policy Objectives and the Next Generation of CPA Systems: An Analytical Framework,” Discussion Paper No. 2015–6, Bank of Canada, 2015. 13  Seigniorage is the revenue earned from the issue of money. In 2014, the Bank of Canada’s seigniorage was about $1.3 billion. 14  B. Fung, K. Huynh and G. Stuber, “The Use of Cash in Canada,” Bank of Canada Review (Spring 2015): 45–56. 
   6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  This would create a new dynamic in the global monetary order, one in which central banks would struggle to implement monetary policy. And, central banks couldn’t act as lenders of last resort as they do for their own currencies. This means that households and businesses could suffer important losses if such an e-money were to crash. We need to anticipate this and manage the risks and benefits that could arise from the broader adoption of e-money. The Bank will explore these and many other trends over the course of our three-year corporate plan. To do this, we’re expanding the range of techniques we use for analysis. For example, we’ve begun to capitalize on “big data” to do things that aren’t possible with traditional economic statistics. Prices collected from retail websites can be used to study pricing behaviour. Social media used by people of all ages to express likes and dislikes may become a vital source of data to understand the perception and credibility of monetary policy. We’re also drawing on techniques from behavioural economics to study such things as how people form expectations. If we don’t start now to find new approaches to handle these and other alternative futures, we won’t be prepared for whatever comes our way. Cultivating inquiry and informed risk taking Our strategic plan focuses on new ideas. And if we want the new ideas to match our ambitions, we need the right corporate culture. No matter how successful it is, any business faces natural obstacles that can get in the way of innovation. That is why we are being proactive to make sure they don’t get in our way. The first obstacle to innovation is homogeneous thinking. It’s human nature to have affinity with people who think the same way and use the same jargon. But the echo chamber you create is limiting. People at Rotman and Munk know you often have to look outside your own industry to find ways to improve. We certainly did this during the financial crisis with the creation of liquidity facilities, which involved economists, market experts, IT specialists, lawyers and accountants. Scientists in our Currency Department also cast a wide net when they develop new security features for bank notes. A few years ago, they turned a material used in cancer therapy research into a machine-readable security feature. We got a patent for this innovation. The second obstacle to innovation is that people generally avoid conflict. Not everyone enjoys being at the centre of debate or playing devil’s advocate. Having smart and entrepreneurial people is critical to generate innovation, but it’s not sufficient; you must also have a culture that values inquiry and encourages people to speak freely. There is a lot of wisdom in the concept of integrative thinking proposed by former Rotman Dean Roger Martin: often, two ways of looking at a problem can offer insights. Leaders have to give the example. Good leaders have flexible minds and are open to being challenged. They take the time to listen. They look at all facets of a problem to come up with the best strategy. They don’t step on newly sprouted grass too early. So we’ve added innovation as a formal topic of discussion at our senior leadership meetings. We’ve also put innovation at the heart of our leadership expectations. These expectations are being integrated into our leadership training and embedded in performance management, recruitment and other management practices. Practically speaking, this focus will translate into our managers spending more time with employees and on their employees’ ideas. Leveraging our most important asset – our people – will spur creative ideas and diversity of thought. We’re also implementing new practices to help staff assess the kinds of alternative futures I mentioned earlier. We’re developing an innovation lab for cross-functional groups to assess 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  the implications of low-probability, high-impact economic scenarios. I expect this inquisitive “black hat” perspective will benefit our everyday operations as well.15  The last obstacle to innovation I’ll mention is aversion to risk, which is common among central bankers. This is understandable, given our responsibility as economic stewards. There are no take-backs and writedowns in central banking. That said, we can’t escape the fact that innovation entails risks. A company that creates iPads and iPhones will occasionally produce a Newton. Mark Zuckerberg had it right when he said, “In a world that’s changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.”16  We have to find a way to embrace risks and the occasional failure that comes with risk without jeopardizing our mission. This is why we’re fostering a culture of informed risk taking. To support it, we have a risk-management framework that helps us anticipate, mitigate and manage the risks that could undermine our ability to fulfill our mandate. It also gives us scope to do groundbreaking research and improve our operations and business practices. Reputation figures prominently in our risk analysis. It deserves special attention because it is vital to the success of all of our work. Monetary policy is a good example of this, because it’s more effective when people believe that the Bank will achieve its inflation target. Our credibility took years to build and we intend to preserve it. If we take appropriate risks, our actions will stand the test of time, even if they initially face criticism. The most important thing for the Bank is to do the right thing, not the most popular one. Seeking constructive dialogue To get to the right answers, we need to engage with people outside the Bank. If we don’t engage, we leave ourselves open to confirmation bias and tunnel vision. John Maynard Keynes wrote during the Depression that “It is astonishing what foolish things one can temporarily believe if one thinks too long alone, particularly in economics.”17 That’s truer now than ever. What I’ve learned since joining the Bank of Canada over 14 years ago is that we need to be deliberate in reaching out to people beyond our own four walls. We do it through consultations with the public and market participants. We also talk to about 100 firms every quarter as part of our Business Outlook Survey to get a sense of what entrepreneurs see on the ground. As part of our plan, we devised new ways to reach out. First, we’ve recently launched a program in which outstanding scholars will work with Bank researchers.18 We will benefit from this injection of outside leading-edge thinking. We’re also hosting conferences on the most important economic and financial issues facing Canada. Earlier this year, we held a conference on disappointing global growth rates. And we’re getting ready for others, on e-money and inflation targeting.                                                  15  In Edward de Bono’s Thinking Systems approach, the black hat is one of six thinking modes and focuses on how things could go wrong.

   8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Second, we’re engaging domestic and international counterparts more than ever. It’s important that people outside the Bank understand what we’re working on when it’s still in the early stages, not when it’s all baked into policy. That’s why, this week, we’ve expanded the range of work we post on our website. We’ve started publishing staff research papers under a new process that’s independent of Governing Council. These papers are works-in-progress that will eventually be submitted to peer-reviewed journals. We’re also publishing staff analytical notes and discussion papers on timely and topical issues.19 That way, people can benefit from our analysis while it’s fresh. We expect that this kind of work, at times, will show results that are not fully aligned with the views of the Bank’s Governing Council. That’s okay. The innovation process demands that researchers have the intellectual space to explore ideas. Third, it’s not all about us. The Bank’s culture emphasizes sharing our knowledge. Few people know that we provide technical assistance to other central banks. Our assistance spans the globe and runs the gamut of issues, from economic models to bank note quality inspection to business continuity. One area where our help is frequently solicited is web design, because our website has been recognized as the best in central banking. Closer to home, we’ve introduced new programs to encourage the next generation of researchers, including the Graduate Student Paper Award20 and the Governor’s Challenge. The Governor’s Challenge is a monetary policy competition for undergraduate students in economics that is going on right now. These efforts have a big payback. We learn from other central banks’ experiences and from the original ideas students have. Conclusion Let me wrap up. If there’s one idea I want to leave you with today, it’s this: when the world is moving around you, standing still is a risky strategy. At the Bank, we put innovative thinking at the centre of our strategic plan to make sure that we can navigate what’s ahead. For us, innovation comes from taking a hard look at what we’re doing and considering alternatives. Hubris is the enemy of sound policy. Innovation comes from involving people, like you here today, in our quest to find the best answers. Our commitment to innovation extends to all parts of our business. It will give us the tools to support Canada’s economic and financial well-being for the next 80 years and beyond.                                                   19  J. Muellbauer, P.

   Lars Rohde: Denmark’s fixed exchange rate policy Speech by Mr Lars Rohde, Governor of the National Bank of Denmark, at the annual meeting of the Danish Bankers Association, Copenhagen, 7 December 2015. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to speak. I have the following key messages today: In view of the special circumstances relating to the krone at the beginning of the year, and the ECB’s decision last Thursday to reduce its deposit rate further, I would like to make clear that nothing has changed as regards Danmarks Nationalbank’s willingness and ability to defend Denmark’s fixed exchange rate policy. My second message is that a prolonged period of low interest rates may lead to high asset prices. But subsequently the assets may fall considerably in value, which could result in losses, also for lenders. Furthermore, there is a risk that the low interest rates will impede productivity development in Denmark as they will buoy up unprofitable firms that would otherwise close. Finally, I would like to emphasise that under the new EU recovery and resolution regime for banks, Danmarks Nationalbank remains the lender of last resort. But the banks’ liquidity management should not be based on access to emergency liquidity assistance from Danmarks Nationalbank if they come under pressure. First, let me talk about the economic situation. While growth in the emerging market economies has shifted to a lower gear, the advanced economies are still picking up steam. The USA is in a robust upswing, with rising employment and falling unemployment. In the euro area, virtually all member states are growing at a rate above their potential, so that they are approaching a normal level of capacity utilisation. In Denmark, growth will be a little lower than previously forecast this year, but the Danish economy remains on track and spare resources are likely to become more scarce in the next couple of years. This is seen most clearly in the labour market, where employment is expected to continue to rise, while unemployment is declining. As regards monetary policy, the respective authorities in the USA and the euro area are currently pursuing opposite paths. While the market expects the Federal Reserve to respond to a strong labour market by increasing interest rates soon, the ECB last Thursday reduced its deposit rate by 10 basis points to –30 basis points. In addition, the existing asset purchase programme has been extended. Easing of monetary policy in the euro area is aimed at ensuring that the ECB achieves its target of inflation below, but close to, 2 per cent. In the light of the ECB’s monetary policy steps, Danmarks Nationalbank has chosen to keep its monetary policy interest rates unchanged. From April until and including November, our intervention sales of foreign exchange in the market totalled kr. 230 billion, and therefore it is appropriate to allow the interest rate spread between Denmark and the euro area to narrow a little. We have plenty of patience if it should once again become necessary to intervene to prevent the krone from strengthening. In that situation – as at the beginning of the year – there will be no upper limit to the amount of kroner that Danmarks Nationalbank can make available. We have no target for the size of the foreign exchange reserve. As long as short-term interest rates are lower in Denmark than in the euro area, the reserve even yields a positive return. Furthermore, we can reduce Danmarks Nationalbank’s interest rates if necessary. BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   Since March this year, the foreign exchange reserve has shrunk substantially as a result of intervention in the market, and by the end of November it was kr. 484 billion. That is not much higher than the level before the large inflows of capital in January and February. The capital inflows prompted Danmarks Nationalbank to intervene in the foreign exchange market for very large amounts, and our interest rates were also reduced considerably. The gradual reduction of the foreign exchange reserve reflects that investors have sold kroner since the large inflows of capital at the beginning of the year. But they are not selling them as fast as they have done. All in all, the foreign investors who bought kroner at the beginning of the year have sold them again. Domestic investors have also reduced their holdings of kroner, but at a slower pace, and recently their holdings have increased again. Against that background, the Ministry of Finance, upon the recommendation of Danmarks Nationalbank, has resumed issuance of government bonds. So far, five auctions have been held, and demand has generally been high. 10 months have now passed since we reduced the rate of interest on certificates of deposit to –0.75 per cent. At that time we were moving into unknown territory: never before had Danmarks Nationalbank’s interest rates been so low, and internationally only Switzerland had introduced a corresponding level a short while earlier. The low interest rates have had the desired effect. The krone has remained stable against the euro and there have not been any signs of cash hoarding. Historically, monetary policy interest rates have been a little higher in Denmark than in the euro area. But right now the interest rate spread to the euro area is negative. This means that investors are willing to hold financial assets in Danish kroner even if the return is a little lower than for euro investments. The long-term interest rate spread between Denmark and Germany is positive, however. Like Denmark, Germany has a robust economy and current account surpluses. Furthermore, interest rates in Germany are to a large extent affected by the ECB’s asset purchase programme. The reduced interest rate spread to the euro area may be attributable to Denmark’s build-up of considerable net foreign assets in recent years. The increased wealth gives rise to various payment flows that tend to strengthen the krone, thereby reducing the interest rate spread. The accumulation of Danish net foreign assets is not a passing phenomenon. Consequently, there is reason to believe that the interest rate spread to the euro area will, in the long term, be lower than previously. Exactly how much lower it will be is difficult to say. Recent years have been characterised by extraordinary events such as the sovereign debt crisis in a number of euro area member states and, most recently, quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, ECB. So these years cannot be seen as an indicator of the situation in the longer term. All the same, it seems likely that Danmarks Nationalbank’s interest rates will be very close to those of the ECB in future, and at times also a little lower. Shifts in the willingness of domestic investors to hold unhedged positions in euro may lead to fluctuations in the size of Danmarks Nationalbank’s foreign exchange reserve. It can become considerably larger than it has previously been. We have seen a clear example of that this year. If Danish investors are not willing to take on the foreign exchange risk linked to larger net foreign assets, it will fall upon Danmarks Nationalbank, and the interest rate spread becomes low or negative. This is part of the fixed exchange rate policy, which has been the foundation for a stable economy for more than three decades. I will now turn my attention to credit quality. During the crisis we learnt, once again, that the value of the collateral pledged for loans may decrease considerably. This was the case for e.g. agricultural land, commercial properties and not least housing. In some cases the price dropped so much that the value of the collateral fell below the loan amount. As a result, a loan which looked safe at the time when it was granted might later result in large losses if the borrower defaulted and the collateral had to be realised. This led to losses for credit institutions, especially for the banks, as their loans are subordinated. 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   We should not forget that. At present this probably applies mainly to housing loans in the Copenhagen area. Here, the rate of price increase has been unsustainably high for some time, although quarterly price increases for owner-occupied flats have slowed down since the spring. The higher prices should be seen in the context of low interest rates and a rise in the population of the capital. One reason why this has so strong an impact on prices is the absence of automatic stabilisers in the form of countercyclical housing taxes. With the freeze on land tax in 2016, which will push up prices in the cities in particular, fluctuations will be even larger. That will increase the risk of the value of the home subsequently falling below the loan amount. When the housing bubble burst, we saw that prices in Copenhagen can dive very sharply. All the same, the credit institutions’ losses on housing loans were modest. This was mainly because of the low interest rates, which helped ensure that most homeowners were still able to service their loans. However, we cannot assume that interest rates will also be low the next time house prices fall. The fact that interest rates may go up and house prices down should be a natural element in the assessment of potential loans. These are sound principles, which are also reflected in the new guidelines from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority on “Prudent credit assessment when granting housing loans in growth areas”. The currently very low level of interest rates makes it cheaper for firms to service their debt. And the low level of interest rates is, so to speak, acting as a life-support mechanism for some of them. If interest rates rise, and the firms have variable rate loans, it may soon turn out that they are unable to survive. The clearest example of this is the agricultural sector. In 2014, nearly 25 per cent of all farms were operating at a loss, even though they were being buoyed up strongly by the very low interest rates. If the rate of interest had been 2.5 percentage points higher in 2014, nearly half of all farms would have been in the red. That is, twice as many as was actually the case due to the very low interest rates. An interest rate increase of 2.5 percentage points is not a lot. If the variable interest rate on mortgage loans rises by 2.5 percentage points, it will more or less match the current rate of interest on fixed rate mortgage loans. This indicates that close to one in two farmers cannot afford to remortgage into a fixed rate loan, which would otherwise provide protection against future increases in short-term interest rates. This emphasises how vulnerable the agricultural sector is – and that many farmers have only been saved by the very low interest rates. The implications of the very low level of interest rates should be taken into account when a bank assesses how to deal with a defaulted loan. This applies to all loans – not just agricultural loans. In some cases it may be better to shut down the exposure rather than waiting and hoping that the firm will, despite tough odds, survive and be able to repay all its loans, including interest. Especially if the bank must finance a deficit to keep the firm afloat. That is bad for the bank, which risks eventually suffering a larger loss than it would otherwise have done. And it is bad for the economy because it impedes productivity development. Labour and capital are tied up in firms that are not viable, which means that they cannot be employed where they are most productive. I will now address the issue of cyber risk; a topic that is receiving considerable attention both in Denmark and abroad. In an increasingly digitised world, society is dependent on IT systems functioning and data being protected. That also applies to the financial sector. It is well known that future problems may be of a type not previously seen, and the next challenge to financial stability could well be a cyber attack. For Danmarks Nationalbank, increased focus on cyber risk is a priority. I have put cyber risk on the agenda for the meeting of the Systemic Risk Council later this month. Another topic currently receiving much attention is market liquidity. The focus is mainly on declining and less resiliant liquidity in the bond markets. High liquidity supports an efficient BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  
   financial system. Danmarks Nationalbank regularly assesses whether changes in liquidity may have negative implications for financial stability and keeps up a dialogue with market participants. As we also do in other areas, we appreciate our close cooperation with the Danish Bankers Association and its members in this respect. Market liquidity cannot be measured directly. Therefore, an assessment of liquidity must be based on a number of indicators. In the market for mortgage bonds, traditional liquidity measures do not show any clear signs of reduced liquidity. All the same, liquidity has been more volatile since late 2014, which indicates that it has become less resiliant. Hence, there is a risk that smaller shocks than previously may cause liquidity in the bond market to evaporate. Market participants point out that market makers have become less willing to absorb imbalances between bond supply and demand. This should be seen in the context of lower risk appetite and increased capital and liquidity regulation since the financial crisis, which could mean that the banks reduce their market making in the bond market. Over the last year, Danish banks have reduced their portfolios of mortgage bonds for market making, which supports this view. Liquidity in Danish government bonds fell in 2015. The same pattern can be seen in other European government debt markets, but Denmark was particularly severely affected due to the suspension of issuance. Since bond issuance was resumed in October, demand has generally been high, and liquidity has improved. Trading volumes are back at the level seen before the suspension of issuance. Price quotation has also become sharper, but there is still room for improvement. Finally, I would like to mention that we – like the rest of the EU – now have a new recovery and resolution regime, the BRRD, which lays down uniform rules for handling distressed banks. The rules must be fully implemented by 1 January 2016. The fundamental principle is that the owners and creditors should bear any losses, not the government. This is a sound principle that is to eliminate the implied government guarantee for the largest banks. Under the new set of rules, all banks are required to prepare recovery plans. These plans must describe how the bank can respond if it encounters difficulties. The bank should, to a far higher degree than previously, be able to take the necessary steps to restore its liquidity situation itself. A bank must never count on emergency liquidity assistance from Danmarks Nationalbank.  Danmarks Nationalbank is still the lender of last resort, as we have always been. This applies in connection with liquidity problems in the sector in general, but also if a single solvent bank has an urgent need for emergency liquidity assistance – ELA. The role of lender of last resort is an element of Danmarks Nationalbank’s task of contributing to financial stability. But the banks’ liquidity management should obviously not be based on access to emergency liquidity assistance from Danmarks Nationalbank if they come under pressure. If a bank requests ELA, Danmarks Nationalbank as lender will assess whether the bank is solvent and creditworthy and thus able to repay the loan when it matures. Danmarks Nationalbank will include the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority’s assessment of the bank’s solvency and liquidity as a natural element in this connection. Furthermore, Danmarks Nationalbank will require adequate collateral for the amount granted. No banks are precluded from ELA in advance. But besides considering solvency, creditworthiness and the ability to pledge collateral, Danmarks Nationalbank will assess whether financial stability considerations warrant ELA. This assessment will be based on the specific circumstances in the relevant situation. Under the new recovery and resolution regime, the Financial Stability Company, as the resolution authority, is given a number of resolution tools to prevent a resolution from causing financial instability. This means that there is a genuine alternative to granting ELA. We therefore expect the new recovery and resolution regime to limit the number of situations where ELA is relevant. 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   Let me conclude by reiterating my three key messages: Neither the unusual circumstances relating to the krone at the beginning of the year nor the ECB’s decision last Thursday to reduce its deposit rate further affects Danmarks Nationalbank’s willingness and ability to defend Denmark’s fixed exchange rate policy. My second message is that the banks should be aware that a long period of low interest rates may entail credit quality risks, e.g. via fluctuations in the value of the collateral. The low interest rates may also impede productivity as they will buoy up unprofitable firms that would otherwise close. My final message is that Danmarks Nationalbank is the lender of last resort, also under the new EU recovery and resolution regime for banks. But let me emphasise that the banks’ liquidity management must not be based on access to emergency liquidity assistance from Danmarks Nationalbank. Thank you. BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Juyeol Lee: Leverage in Asia Opening address by Mr Juyeol Lee, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the Bank of Korea-IMF conference “Leverage in Asia: Lessons from the Past, What’s New Now?, and Where to Watch Out For?”, Seoul, 11 December 2015. *      *      * Greeting Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for the Bank of Korea, together with the IMF, to host this conference on “Leverage in Asia,” which is sponsored by the Korean Ministry of Strategy and Finance. I sincerely welcome all of you attending. My special gratitude goes to Director Siddharth Tiwari of the IMF Strategy, Policy and Review Department, our keynote speaker, and to Deputy Director Kalpana Kochhar of the IMF Asia and Pacific Department, the conference co-organizer. I would also like to thank First Vice Minister Joo Hyung-Hwan of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, who will deliver the welcoming remarks. Let me express sincere appreciation as well to all of our esteemed conference speakers, discussants, moderators, and panelists. Leverage in emerging market economies has drawn increased attention lately, given the so-called G2 risks, stemming from U.S. monetary policy normalization and slowing growth in China. At this important juncture, I think today’s conference is a very meaningful opportunity to consider the current status of leverage in Asia and the related potential risks, in order to seek effective policy measures in response. Current status of leverage in Asia During the global financial crisis, the global economy suffered a severe recession. Asian economies were also affected, but managed to recover from the crisis relatively quickly thanks to their lower leverage compared to the U.S. and Europe. Whereas advanced countries have carried out deleveraging since the crisis, leverage ratios in Korea and many other Asian countries have been rising. This is due largely to the abundant global liquidity provided by major advanced countries through their unprecedented quantitative easing, and to the accommodative policies pursued in Asian countries. The resulting lower borrowing costs, coupled with easier access to finance, have led to higher leverage in our region. Effects of increased leverage on the economy Leverage occurs in the process where economic agents fund their economic activities. Specifically, it increases when households try to smooth out fluctuations in their consumption, when firms raise funds for investment, and when the government spends more than its tax revenues. As long as leverage increases within a manageable extent, it helps to boost growth by promoting economic activities. If leverage rises excessively, however, relative to the country’s fundamentals, it can constrain consumption, investment and other activities as economic agents’ debt burdens grow. In an extreme case, it can heighten the credit risks of borrowers and financial institutions, and destabilize the financial system. The country’s sovereign rating can fall as a result, with inevitable impacts on the real economy. Since the global financial crisis, the financial interconnectedness across countries has deepened greatly due to expanded international capital movements. As a result, changes in monetary policy or financial conditions in one country can have considerable effects on those 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  in other countries. And if one country suffers financial instability owing to excessive leverage, then other countries are more likely to face contagion risks now more than ever before. Policy response measures In the future, the degree of global financial accommodation is likely to gradually decline with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalization, leading international financial conditions to develop in directions different from those seen until now. In these circumstances, both the public and private sectors need to devote greater attention to stable, appropriate management of their leverage. Financial institutions need to improve their capabilities for screening when supplying credit to borrowers. This will allow them to manage their leverage well, both quantitatively and qualitatively. They also need to expand the shares of stable funding, to minimize any adverse shocks in case the global financial environment changes. Borrowers, for their part, need to maintain stable financial structures, by properly managing their risks stemming from future income flows, from changes in interest rates, and from possible maturity mismatches between their assets and liabilities. On the policy authority side, efforts should be made, using macro-prudential policies, to prevent any excessive rise in leverage. Corporate restructuring is needed as well, since the continuing operation of inefficient firms only leads leverage to increase. And when deciding on monetary and fiscal policies, the effects of these policies on leverage should also be carefully investigated. Asian emerging market economies have substantial external debt, and are therefore vulnerable to external shocks, due for example, to U.S. dollar appreciation. Policymakers should thus devote efforts to developing and implementing new measures to ensure external sector stability. Policies for macro-economic stability are of foremost importance, and the strengthening of financial cooperation among countries world wide is also essential. Conclusion I am confident that today’s conference will be a valuable opportunity for participants to carefully evaluate the potential risks associated with leverage in Asian countries, and to discuss in-depth policies to alleviate them. I also believe that the insightful suggestions made in this conference will help us to find ways of strengthening the financial systems and economic fundamentals of countries in Asia and around the world. Let me conclude by saying once again how much I appreciate you all taking time from your busy schedules to participate in the conference here today. Thank you. 
   François Villeroy de Galhau: Supervision of business practices Opening speech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution (ACPR), at the ACPR conference “Supervision of business practices”, Paris, 20 November 2015. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to welcome you today to this new conference organised by the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution and would like to thank you all for coming. This is an opportunity for me to tell you for the first time how important I find this type of event, where the Authority that I chair explains its actions and the principles that guide it. It is also an opportunity for us all to listen to the parties concerned, on a topic that brings us together today – that of the supervision of business practices – on which I would like to put forward three ideas: (I) First, our supervision of business practices is important for the current mobilisation of the nation. (II) Second, our supervision of business practices is important for financial stability. (III) Lastly, our supervision of business practices must increasingly take account of developments in technology and changes in Europe. Our supervision of business practices is important for the current mobilisation of the nation. Many lessons can be learned from the dramatic events of Friday 13 November in Paris and its suburbs, which requires of us a total mobilisation. Faced with these barbaric acts, I wish to recall the determination of the Banque de France – and of the financial sector – to participate in the fight against terrorism, by attacking its financing.  Many of you will attend this afternoon the presentations, introduced by Mr Delas, Vice-Chairman of the ACPR, on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing in the insurance sector. As you know, the ACPR College, together with Tracfin, adopted just last week new guidelines in this area, applicable to both banks and insurance firms. I am in no doubt that the financial sector will be fully involved in their implementation; we will ensure this together with the professionals. I would also like to recall today our determination to fully participate in the mobilisation of the nation, by contributing more broadly to economic and social cohesion, through greater banking and financial inclusion. The protection of consumers – and in particular the most vulnerable ones – is one of the components of this. Financial education and the fight against overindebtedness are also priorities to which the Banque de France actively contributes. Terrorism, alas, also feeds off exclusion in its different forms. II/ Second, our supervision of business practices is also important for financial stability. Since its creation in 2010, the ACPR has been responsible for safeguarding financial stability and ensuring consumer protection. This is a major innovation, a robust step, in the wake of the 2008 crisis and the loss of confidence of customers in their financial sector in many advanced economies, sometimes due to deceptive business practices. Restoring confidence is of course in the interest of all those present in this room. This means, for us, ensuring compliance with existing laws and regulations, as well as with the best practices observed or recommended by the ACPR. BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   Naturally, this consumer protection task is not designed to enforce these different rules in a blanket fashion. Rather, it must be done in accordance with the principles underlying these regulations and fully understanding the reality of these business practices. To sum it up in one sentence, these principles aim to balance relations between clients and professionals. This rebalancing is mainly achieved by taking account of the information asymmetry that can exist between these players. This may include rules that are specific to vulnerable clients, to a category of complex products, to the obligation to consider the interest of customers when the product is designed or in the organisation of product distribution. The reality of business practices, however, is difficult to sum up in a few words. This is where the work of ACPR staff comes into play; in the supervision as well as analysis of different data and through contact with both professionals and consumers. Collecting data on business practices is a prerequisite for the ACPR to guide its supervisory duties. Against this backdrop, the ACPR redesigned its questionnaire on business practices and consumer protection. It can now understand current market practices, as well as trends in products, services and practices. I will now talk about ACPR inspections. They are firstly intended to ensure compliance with the applicable rules and to make sure that errors are corrected before they have consequences for customers. In the worst cases, such errors lead to sanctions. This approach is necessary to punish violations and useful to increase awareness in the profession. ACPR inspections are not however limited to dealing with bad practices on a case-by-case basis. They also identify more general problems that call for changes in market practices or even in regulations. Several examples will be discussed this morning to illustrate the lessons learned from such inspections. For instance, ACPR staff examined distribution channels in which there are a number of intermediaries between the customer and the producer (bank or more often insurer). The questions that we are asking today are simple. But they are important for the sector as a whole. Do all intermediaries provide value added to the customer? How can we guarantee the customer a reliable and efficient chain, irrespective of its organisation? To enhance practices, the ACPR also has a flexible legal tool, the recommendation. I believe that this instrument is useful for prevention. Recommendations are intended to change or guide the behaviour of professionals. It helps them to identify and actually integrate what is expected of them in terms of consumer protection. Generally, the area of business practices is one in which it is quite conceivable that some best practices can be defined by the players themselves. To do this, dialogue is required as well as commitments that are binding enough to be enforced. The AERAS Agreementwhich aims to facilitate access to credit for people with serious health problems, is a good example and I would like to thank Mr Emmanuel Constans, Chairman of the AERAS Mediation Committee and member of the ACPR College for having agreed to present today the changes in this Agreement. III/ Lastly, our supervision of business practices must increasingly take account of developments in technology and in changes in Europe. I believe that it is important, not only for the ACPR but also for the market, to anticipate these changes wherever possible. European legislation that is recent or in the process of being adopted calls for the standardisation of customer information. This is the case for the Packaged Retail and Insurance-Based Investment Products (PRIIPs), the Directive on Credit Agreements Relating to Residential immovable Property (CARRP), and the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD). Also, under the aegis of the AMF, with which we share a joint unit that is efficient at 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   supervising business practices, there is the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). European legislation recasts the obligations of product distributors to include in particular the concept of independent advice in the sectoral directives. It also makes changes to the obligations of product manufacturers by imposing a product design process that takes account of the interests and characteristics of the targeted customers. Lastly, extensive work on the delicate subject of the compensation of sales staff and other employees should be completed in the coming months. As regards the latest and not least substantial European developments in the area of business practices, the aim of the drive to standardise rules in the framework of a cross-sectoral approach is simplification. This drive should be extended. An obvious case is the Key Information Document of the PRIIPS Regulation. It will allow customers to easily compare two investment products, irrespective of whether they are classified as bank products, insurance products or financial instruments. But I could also cite examples of work in the area of “product governance”, conflicts of interest or compensation, which bring regulations from the three sectors closer into line. I will finish by discussing changes stemming from new technologies. We are all aware that they change business practices by affecting consumption patterns and customer relations. The contractual nature of the banking and insurance industries means that relationships are rich and often long-standing. Such relationships are based on the consent of both parties to the contract and execution on the basis of trust. Today, over and above agreement on the price and on the object, which forms the basis for a sales contract, the possible use and security of customer data is increasingly relevant. The development of new technologies and the appearance of new tools, aimed at making the “customer experience” more fluid or attractive, must also take into account the cardinal principle of consumer protection. This is also a necessary condition for new sustainable and robust economic models to emerge. These areas are currently the main focus of the national and European authorities and the ACPR stands ready to play a full role, drawing on its experience and the dialogue it engages in with the stakeholders.  Let me now hand the floor to Patrick Montagner and to the ACPR staff to elaborate on a number of these aspects and I wish you an excellent conference. Thank you for your attention.

Salvatore Rossi: Finance for growth – a capital markets union Keynote address by Mr Salvatore Rossi, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the Rome Investment Forum 2015 “Financing Long-Term Europe”, Rome, 11 December 2015. *      *      * I would like to comment on the proposal for a capital markets union (CMU) by raising three questions, and giving some tentative answers to all of them. The first question is: do we actually need a CMU in Europe? Should it really be a priority in the European policy agenda? My answer is a resounding “yes!”. The question may seem rhetorical, given the tide of apologetic documents, papers, and seminars (including perhaps this one) that have been dedicated to the project since its official launch last year. However, I think it”s important to keep in mind the reasons for that “yes”, because hesitations and even open dislike are quite widespread in some countries and sectors. The fact is that the European economies, with the partial exception of the UK, are strongly dependent on banks for their financing needs. Too dependent. Let me explain why. A wide literature (I have in mind for example a very recent piece of empirical research by Langfield and Pagano, 2015), shows that economic growth tends to be lower in economies with a bank-based financial structure, particularly at times of falling asset prices, and systemic risk to be higher. A “bank bias”, as L&P dub it, is bad, in any circumstance. But even if we believed, just for the sake of the argument, in the optimality of banking dominance in our financial systems, here comes another hard fact: also as a consequence of the new regulatory and supervisory framework, banks are less and less willing to lend money to risky borrowers such as SMEs, because of the heavy burden of non-performing loans which is the legacy of the crisis; because more capital is required against risky assets, and capital is costly. Requests for more capital buffers come from all international regulating bodies, both at the global level (Financial Stability Board, Basel Committee) and at the European level (Single Supervisory Mechanism – SSM), as a shield against a new, devastating financial crisis. Up to now, in Europe the effect has been procyclical: notwithstanding the cheap, abundant liquidity supplied by the ECB, banks are reluctant to increase lending to the real economy. The corporate sector, especially in southern Europe, is mostly made up of SMEs, for which access to financial and capital markets is difficult, if not impossible. Hence, we have an inconsistent trio: an economic structure mostly requesting bank finance, regulators concerned with the risks posed by banks” activity, and banks consequently stepping back from ample parts of the credit markets. How to sort ourselves out? One way is to move the European financial structure from intermediaries towards markets (Visco, 2015). This will indeed require national efforts, but more is needed: an integrated European-wide capital market, with harmonised and SME-friendly rules. In other words, a CMU. The second question is: can we consider a European CMU a realistic project? This time my answer is much more doubtful. The idea for a CMU was first put forward by the President of the European Commission before the European Parliament in July 2014 (Juncker, 2014), in very ambitious language. Last September the Commission presented an action plan to transform that enlightened vision into reality (EC, 2015). From one document to the other the degree of ambition was apparently scaled down. As Nicolas Véron (2015) recently noted, the plan “mostly boils down to pruning existing rules and correcting some of [the] EU”s own recent regulatory overreach”. BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 
   But this is supposed to be the normal business of the Commission. Let”s check whether this harsh judgment is well founded. What does CMU mean in substance? It means creating a single market of non-bank financial services: the belated completion of the Single Market project of the “80s. A first attempt at merging European financial markets fifteen years ago did not succeed. In the goods market the main obstacles to integration were technical standards: harmonising them was the crucial move. In the financial services market, obstacles are of various kinds: every country has its own legal system, tax treatment, accounting standards, and prudential regulation (Danielsson et al., 2015). These specificities are entrenched with local costumes and traditions, and in some cases they protect national champions. Harmonising the myriad of laws, taxes, and regulations in a short period of time, as the urgency of the matter would require, is extremely challenging. The most delicate problem has to do with the UK. It’s quite obvious that a European CMU excluding the City of London would have little sense. But the UK Government is highly sensitive about London’s competitive advantage as the financial hub of Europe, and the issue will remain almost intractable until the referendum on the UK remaining part of the European Union is held. The third question is: what can be done to facilitate/accelerate the process of creating a pan-European CMU? The approach followed by the action plan is a step-by-step one. Such an approach was recommended, not by chance, by most of the stakeholders involved in a wide public consultation held by the Commission in the first half of this year. Is it the right approach? In principle, one might have preferred a bolder attitude, one that addressed simultaneously and directly all the needed harmonisation in the fields, for instance, of bankruptcy laws, taxes, investor protection and market infrastructure regulations: a Thatcher-like “big bang”. But that would have been definitely unrealistic. What the action plan intends to do, and I quote a key passage of the document, is to proceed “from the bottom up, identifying barriers and knocking them down one by one, creating a sense of momentum”. Among those to be knocked down first are, according to the plan: • red tape and information asymmetries making it too costly for SMEs to list on equity and debt markets; • specific rules in both the new European insurance regulatory framework (Solvency 2) and in the capital requirement regulation for banks (CRR) preventing insurance companies and banks from getting more involved in the business of financing infrastructure investment; • a sort of damnation still weighing on securitisation after the global financial crisis (asset-backed securities were labelled “toxic sludge”), while, if simple and transparent, it could be a fundamental tool to bridge the gap between SMEs and financial markets. • and so on and so forth ... These are all good intentions. Are they sufficient to create a “sense of momentum”? We will see. The risk is that we fall into a sort of “Ten Little Indians” trap. A risk still present, for example, in the banking union story. Banking union was conceived as an institutional framework with three pillars (Rossi, 2015): an SSM, a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), and a Single Deposit Insurance Scheme (SDIS). The three pillars were originally meant to be concurrent, symmetric, and logically connected. But the outcome has been different. The SSM was swiftly realised because it was seen as a prerequisite for restoring mutual trust among countries after the sovereign debt 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   crisis. But mistrust has remained. On the crucial issue of bank resolution, after long and tiresome negotiations it has been decided that sharing the cost of a banking crisis among all the eurozone countries is not for now; it is foreseen as the final step in a process lasting many years, and in any case it will involve private funds only (the Single Resolution Fund, financed by all the eurozone banks). The use of money from the taxpayers of countries other than the one where the bank’s head office is located has been ruled out – contrary to the original intention (anyhow, the use of national public money is in general forbidden by state aid rules). As to the SDIS, it was first postponed to an indefinite future; more recently, a proposal has been presented by the European Commission, but envisaging the same many-year process before reaching a mutualisation such as the one established for the Single Resolution Fund. The CMU, needless to say, is a totally different endeavour. Still, overcoming the variety of national habits and interests will be a formidable task, the inherent difficulty of which must not be underestimated if we want CMU eventually to succeed.

   Mario Draghi: Monetary policy and structural reforms in the euro area Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at Prometeia40, Bologna, 14 December 2015. *      *      * Summary The tools we have deployed since June 2014 are producing the intended effects, said Mario Draghi in a speech in Bologna today. Following the recalibration of our instruments decided by the Governing Council earlier this month, the ECB expects inflation to return to its objective without undue delay. The President also said that if the ECB had to intensify the use of its instruments to ensure that it achieves its price stability mandate, it would. However, while monetary policy can deliver price stability, that alone does not guarantee lasting prosperity. To have a structural recovery we need to raise not just current growth but potential growth as well. The key to this is higher investment. Investment has been held back in the euro area by three things: weak demand dynamics, the still-high private debt overhang and fragile private sector confidence. The euro area today needs to take additional steps, alongside supporting demand, to address the debt overhang and fragile confidence. Structural reforms are key to this end. It is clear that, in some countries, the large stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) is still preventing a stronger recovery in credit. All this explains why facilitating a work-out of NPLs has to be part of the package of policy actions to restore productive investment. The ongoing work towards a Capital Market Union (CMU) is an opportunity to accelerate progress also on this front. If we are to truly underpin confidence, it is important that, even while dealing with more pressing priorities, we do not lose sight of the need to complete our monetary union. *      *      * After a crisis lasting eight years, the European economy appears at long last to be on a more solid footing. The recovery is now led by domestic demand rather than exports; it has proven to be resilient to the recent slowdown in global trade. Monetary policy has given a decisive impetus to this. The tools deployed since June 2014, in particular the asset purchase programme of public and private sector securities introduced in September of last year and expanded in January this year, are producing their desired effects. Following the Governing Council’s recalibration of our instruments earlier this month, we expect inflation to reach our objective without undue delay. But we continue to closely observe movements in economic and financial conditions. As I said at the last Council meeting, and again more recently, “there is no doubt that, if we had to intensify the use of our instruments to ensure that we achieve our price stability mandate, we would”. But the shocks that have hit our economy since 2008 were not merely of a cyclical nature. They were also structural. In this context, while monetary policy can secure price stability, that alone cannot bring lasting prosperity for our economies. It is essential, therefore, to intervene on both the supply and demand sides and to act consistently on all fronts to consolidate the turning of the cycle, and at the same time create the conditions for a sound and lasting recovery. What I would like to discuss today is the way in which different policies can help achieve this result, by acting not sequentially but simultaneously in their respective spheres of responsibility. BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   The role of monetary policy One characteristic of this crisis was the fall in the potential growth rate in the euro area, which is the pace at which the economy can grow on a stable basis without overheating, and so without generating inflation. It is estimated that this rate is now around 1% in the euro area, compared with around 2% in the United States, where the crisis was in fact accompanied by a decline in the potential growth rate as well. This means that even with a strong cyclical recovery growth will be fairly low. To ensure a structural recovery, we must boost not just short-term cyclical growth, but also long-term potential growth. In determining potential growth, the role of investment is crucial. It increases at once today’s demand and tomorrow’s supply. In the euro area, however, the recovery has thus far mainly concerned consumption and only to a lesser degree involved investment, which is still 15% lower than its pre-crisis levels. This weakness is, moreover, common to other advanced economies as well. In the euro area, investment is being held back primarily by three factors: weak demand, the debt overhang, which was building up already in the period preceding the crisis, and the private sector’s shaky confidence in the growth prospects of our economies. At the same time, as in a virtuous circle, an increase in investment, by strengthening demand, supports the recovery, lessens the debt burden and boosts confidence. To this end, monetary policy can play a vital role in speeding up the return of output to its potential level if the output gap is wide and inflation below the objective. This is what the ECB is doing with the measures implemented since the middle of last year, in a context of prolonged low inflation. We have cut the official rates down to negative levels, approved a credit easing packages – most notably with the targeted longer-term refinancing operations – and expanded our purchase programme of public and private sector securities. Since June 2014 banks’ lending rates to firms have fallen steeply, by about 80 basis points for the euro area as a whole and with decreases of up to 100–140 basis points in the countries most badly hit by the crisis. So the transmission of our monetary policy has been powerful: in June 2014, to have a similar effect on banks’ lending rates, we would have had to lower monetary policy rates by 100 basis points, something which at that time was clearly not possible. These measures, according to Eurosystem staff estimates, will help to increase growth in the euro area by about 1% overall between 2015 and 2017. The fall in rates has been accompanied by a recovery in lending to businesses. Last May, before the credit easing measures were announced, lending was declining at an annual rate of about 3% in the area as a whole. Since July, that trend has been halted; in the euro area on average, lending is growing once again, albeit at modest rates. At the height of the crisis, in 2012, small firms reported that access to credit was their principal problem, immediately after the need to find customers. Since April this year, however, access to credit has been one of the least significant of the factors holding back business activity for small and medium-sized enterprises, according to our surveys. Lending terms and conditions have begun to converge rapidly towards those enjoyed by large-scale borrowers. Our measures have therefore proved to be effective in two ways: they have reduced the divergence in lending conditions among euro area countries and they have compressed the dispersion between different categories of borrowers. All of this has helped not just to consolidate the recovery but also to make it more flexible. The weakening of foreign demand from the emerging countries has been offset by increased demand within the euro area, especially from the economies of the “non-core” countries. By supporting the budding recovery, our monetary policy measures have thus made it possible to mitigate the negative effects of the weakening of the emerging countries’ economies on the euro area’s main exporting countries. 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   It is important that the positive effects of our measures have also reached small firms because this means that they have been felt by a large audience and not just by specific economic and social groups, as is sometimes claimed. We must not forget that small and medium-sized enterprises make up 99% of the total number of firms in Europe and, more importantly, provide jobs for two-thirds of all those in employment. Why were our monetary policy measures effective? One of the reasons that lending rates to firms were high in the past is that, given the weakness of economic conditions, banks particularly feared the risk of enterprises becoming insolvent, and for this reason raised their risk premia. However, these higher rates also caused the demand for credit from healthy firms to fall, thus worsening the conditions of the economy and justifying, ex post, the higher risk premia. And so a vicious circle was created. By reducing borrowing costs for new loans, our measures, especially the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, have encouraged banks to resume lending. The increased competition in credit markets has in turn compressed rates, driving lending and improving the macroeconomic picture. We have thus succeeded in breaking the vicious circle. The public and private sector purchase programme has also fuelled competition in credit markets by driving down the yields on sovereign bonds and thus reducing their appeal with respect to loans, ensuring that a growing volume of banking activity is directed towards the real economy. In addition to the direct impact of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, analyses conducted by the ECB show that the asset purchase programme has had an indirect effect on credit supply conditions, by also improving the macroeconomic outlook and further reducing risk premia. And these measures have not damaged the banks. Far from it. Although they may sometimes have led to a contraction in interest income, our measures have also led to capital gains in banks’ assets, and higher volumes and quality of credit. Considering all of these effects, the staff of the ECB estimate that the impact of our measures on the profitability of the banking sector has been essentially nil for the euro area as a whole. The role of other policies The effectiveness of our monetary policy shows that the ECB has all the appropriate tools to achieve our price stability objective and thus to support demand. And within our mandate we are unconstrained in our choice of instruments and the way we deploy them. We can always bring inflation to our objective; we must, and we will. But monetary policy cannot and must not be the only instrument. On the one hand, the risks of a very accommodative monetary policy over an extended period must be addressed with the most appropriate macroprudential instruments. On the other hand, it is clear that there are other economic policy instruments which could improve the effectiveness of monetary policy in closing the output gap. In the past, the limited space for the deployment of fiscal policy has increased the burden on monetary policy; today, the two policies seem to be more coherent in this regard. So monetary policy benefits if other policy areas play their part in their spheres of responsibility. At the same time, insofar as monetary policy succeeds in supporting the cyclical recovery, this facilitates the introduction of structural policies which could encounter greater resistance in a weak macroeconomic climate. None of this is controversial. The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors clearly stated it in the communiqué issued after the meeting in Ankara in September: “Monetary policies will continue to support economic activity consistent with central banks’ mandates, but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth”. For the euro area this means that additional steps need to be taken, alongside supporting demand, to address the other two factors holding back investment: the debt overhang and fragile confidence. BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  
   So what does this entail? Let me highlight two points in particular. First, structural reforms clearly have to be part of the equation. Beyond current demand, investment largely depends on firms’ sentiment about the future: at the micro level, how easy it will be for them to do business, and at the macro level, how confident they feel about future growth. If obstacles to entrepreneurship are high, or if there is too much uncertainty about growth prospects, investment will be lower than it could be. That is why structural reforms are important. By reducing red tape, they cut the costs for firms of starting new projects, thereby raising the effective return on investment. And by encouraging higher labour participation and boosting productivity, reforms raise expectations of demand, giving firms greater confidence to invest today. Investment is, after all, a bet on the future. So structural reforms are, in fact, essential to comply with that part of the Treaty which espouses the objectives of balanced growth, full employment and social advancement, and the promotion of scientific and technological progress. None of those objectives will be achieved unless firms invest in research and development, and in exploiting new technologies and developing skills at the upper end of the value chain; unless, in other words, the conditions that favour high private investment are re-established. Moreover, it is worth remembering that reforms that raise potential growth produce permanently higher income not just for the economy as a whole, but also for governments, through higher tax revenues and more sustainable public debt, which opens up fiscal space. And that, in turn, means there is more scope for fiscal policy to support monetary policy in stabilising the economy. Second, in the area of structural reforms, special attention should be paid to measures that bring about a reduction in the debt overhang. Certainly, a lot has already been achieved in the banking sector with the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and as part of that, the comprehensive assessment and the ensuing significant recapitalisation of the banking sector. This has also supported the repair of the banking lending channel and the monetary policy transmission mechanism. But it is clear that, in some countries, the large stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) is still preventing a stronger pick-up in lending. High stocks of NPLs can dampen credit supply for several reasons: they absorb resources and operational capacity; they tie up bank capital in unproductive uses; and they reduce bank profitability, which weighs on banks’ capacity to generate capital internally. Such effects on lending tend to be exacerbated for smaller firms, which are more dependent on bank lending. Moreover, slow resolution of NPLs hampers the necessary process of corporate restructuring during which viable firms reduce their debt and start investing again, and non-viable firms exit from the market. Creating the conditions for a rapid workout of NPLs has to be part of the economic policy actions to restore conditions that favour productive investment. Each country has its own list of actions needed to speed up this process, and delays on this front are a serious drag on growth. In particular, well-designed insolvency regimes are key in separating viable from non-viable borrowers and in facilitating the valuation of assets to be sold off. An efficient judicial system is also essential. Analysis by ECB staff shows that the pace of deleveraging is faster in countries that have a strong and effective legal apparatus. From this perspective, the recent reform of insolvency law in Italy is welcome. It is estimated that the average length of bankruptcy procedures will be halved. Foreclosure times are also expected to decrease significantly. This is important because a shorter time to recover collateral brings the market value of non-performing assets closer to a level at which transactions can take place, meaning bank deleveraging can accelerate. The ongoing work towards a Capital Markets Union (CMU) is an opportunity to accelerate progress on all fronts. A true CMU should aim to harmonise insolvency regimes and improve 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   their overall quality by converging towards international best practices. That should in turn also help expand secondary markets for distressed debt, helping banks get NPLs off their books more easily. And if CMU is successful in developing European markets for SME asset-backed securities, banks will be able to diversify credit risks from lending to SMEs more easily, strengthening credit supply. Finally, if we are to truly underpin confidence, it is important that, even while dealing with more pressing priorities, we do not lose sight of the need to complete our monetary union. In that context several steps taken by the Commission are steering the process in the right direction. But what is also important for confidence is that those steps form part of a longer-term vision that removes fragility from our union. In sum, the combination of our monetary policy measures on the demand side, coupled with structural reforms on the supply side, goes a long way towards creating the conditions for a genuinely structural recovery. Monetary policy and structural reforms together support demand, deleveraging and confidence, all of which are key for increasing investment. But when it comes to actually implementing the reform agenda, in many countries of the euro area hesitation seems to prevail over determination. Certainly, we need to bear in mind that the necessary changes are on such a scale as to be unachievable without major consensus. But we also need to bear in mind that delays in making important structural reforms, which make a country more prosperous and more able to face today’s challenges, may sometimes have political reasons, but never economic ones.

   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Eddie Yue: Internationalisation of the renminbi – trends and developments Keynote address by Mr Eddie Yue, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the 5th Hong Kong - London RMB Forum, Seminar on RMB Business, Hong Kong, 11 December 2015. *      *      * Katharine [Braddick], Peter [Alexander], distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to be hosting the 5th Hong Kong – London Renminbi (RMB) Forum. May I extend a very warm welcome to all of you attending this Seminar which forms part of the Forum, especially our guests travelling from London. This annual congregation is a reflection of the importance we place in the long-established RMB business co-operation between Hong Kong and London. And, the Seminar could not have come at a better time. Just 10 days ago, the International Monetary Fund announced its decision to include the RMB in its Special Drawing Rights basket. Naturally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority welcomes the announcement as it represents a milestone in the development of the RMB. The IMF’s decision reaffirms the Chinese currency’s status as a freely usable currency, and enhances the representativeness of the SDR basket. Indeed, based on market projections, the RMB’s inclusion in the basket could bring up to US$1 trillion worth of investments in RMB assets by central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranational organisations, large pension funds and institutional investors over the next five years. More importantly, I believe, the IMF’s decision will promote further confidence in using the RMB for international trade and financial transactions, giving more impetus to RMB’s internationalisation process. The IMF’s decision therefore represents a key milestone in the RMB’s internationalisation. Significant progress has also made in other areas in the cross-border use of the RMB over the past year. And, I see three important trends emerging: Key trends on RMB internationalisation First is the continuing liberalisation of the capital accounts with major breakthroughs in new policy headroom granted by the Mainland authorities. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect has been in place and operating smoothly since November 2014, allowing international investors access to the A-shares listed in Shanghai through the stock exchange in Hong Kong, and vice versa. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds scheme was implemented in July this year, allowing Mainland and Hong Kong funds to be distributed in each other’s markets through a streamlined approval process. Eligible funds currently going through that approval process are expected to be launched in the market shortly. Since June, offshore banks have also been allowed to conduct repos in the onshore interbank bond market, while since July, foreign central banks, sovereign wealth funds and supranational organisations have been allowed access to the onshore interbank bond market without investment quotas and to conduct a much wider range of transactions. They were also granted access to the Chinese foreign exchange market in September. These have been key steps in liberating the capital accounts. And there will be more to come. We look forward to the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and looking further ahead, the Mainland authorities have announced plans to consider implementing the Qualified Domestic Individual Investors scheme (QDII2) on a trial basis. It’s certainly true that individuals on the Mainland have shown a great deal of interest in diversifying their investment holdings. This is an area where we see Hong Kong having a strong competitive advantage, with our strategic location, our expertise in private banking and wealth management business, coupled with our strong client networks on the Mainland. To 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  capitalise on these emerging opportunities, we have been liaising closely with the Mainland authorities on QDII2.The second trend is that not only is Chinese capital “going out”, Chinese companies are also increasingly "going out". Outward direct investments (ODI) by China to the rest of the world amounted to RMB758.5 billion in 2014, a 63% rise over the past five years. And, it’s interesting to note that 16% of these flows are settled in RMB, up from a mere 3.7% in 2011. This “going out” trend has been continuing for some time, but has been given fresh impetus by the greater desire of Chinese enterprises to diversify into other non-RMB asset classes. New policy measures by the Mainland authorities, notably the ‘Belt and Road’ initiative, has also played a key role. According to the Ministry of Commerce, Chinese enterprises have already invested a total of US$13.2 billion in 49 countries along the “Belt and Road” in the first ten months of this year. The commencement of operations of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is expected to bring about more Chinese capital and companies “going out” over time. Hong Kong’s deep and mature financial markets will be an ideal place for corporates to raise funds for infrastructure projects and manage investments for their ‘Belt and Road’ developments. The capital investment projects are also expected to create new opportunities for the use of RMB in trade and investment activities, giving rise to new opportunities for RMB settlement, financing and asset management in the region. To ride on these opportunities, Hong Kong has been actively pursuing measures to develop into a hub for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) as Chinese corporates and multinational companies expand their footprints and increasingly demand centralised treasury management. The HKMA has been working closely with the Government to develop a concessionary tax regime to provide a more market-friendly environment for these companies to set up their CTCs in Hong Kong, and the relevant amendment bill was introduced into the Legislative Council last week. The third trend is that market developments, both in terms of turnover and product range, have picked up momentum in the past year. There is a rapidly growing list of products provided by our banks in Hong Kong to meet their clients’ liquidity, hedging and other business needs in RMB. At the end of April, the daily turnover of RMB foreign exchange transactions in Hong Kong had reached US$93 billion equivalent, more than eight times greater than five years ago. The average daily turnover of Hong Kong’s RMB Real Time Gross Settlement system also exceeded RMB1 trillion recently. Going forward, we should see more products denominated in RMB. This is an area where market participants can play their part and why we also think seminars like this are important in bringing together ideas and looking at solutions. Building market infrastructure The HKMA has played a major role in promoting market development, with our strategy focusing on strengthening market infrastructure to support offshore RMB business. Indeed, liquidity is the linchpin in growing this offshore business and the HKMA has in place a RMB400 billion currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China which can be activated when market conditions warrant. In addition, we have made available an RMB liquidity facility to banks which is currently offering intraday repos of up to RMB10 billion, as well as overnight funds on T+0 basis and one-day and one-week funds settled on T+1 basis. We have also appointed seven banks as Primary Liquidity Providers (PLPs) and provided each with a bilateral repo facility of up to RMB2 billion. These facilities have helped banks to better manage their RMB liquidity and played a significant role in offshore market development. These facilities will be reviewed from time to time with the aim of providing better liquidity support to the offshore RMB market. Hong Kong has also developed a highly efficient RMB clearing and settlement system. As I mentioned, its average daily turnover exceeded RMB1 trillion recently. We will continue to enhance the service capabilities of our RMB clearing and settlement system to keep pace with business growth. Our system will complement the recently launched Cross-border Interbank 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Payment System (CIPS) by the Mainland authorities, making RMB business transactions even more convenient. Conclusion In conclusion, China’s 13th Five-Year Plan for 2016–2020 has reaffirmed its commitment to opening wider to the world, accelerating the opening up of the capital market and developing RMB as a convertible and freely usable currency. Financial centres like Hong Kong and London, with their robust and mature markets, can play a major role in facilitating further usage of the RMB internationally. In this context, the Hong Kong – London RMB Forum is an essential element in sharing our experiences and learning from each other, particularly in the areas of market and product developments. I wish you all a fruitful seminar.  
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  DeLisle Worrell: Keeping the economy stable and achieving growth Featured address by Dr DeLisle Worrell, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, at the BCCI Finance & investment Luncheon Seminar, Bridgetown, 28 October 2015. *      *      * By dint of economic policies suited to our circumstances the Barbados economy has been kept stable ever since the onset of the global economic recession, now seven years ago. Foreign exchange reserves have been protected by fiscal contraction to reduce spending and importation, to ensure the balance between inflows and outflows of foreign exchange is maintained. As a result, foreign reserves remain adequate, and economic policy and the future development of the economy remain firmly in our own hands. As I have often said, the great value of adequate reserves is that Barbadians are our own economic bosses. The challenge before us remains, to use our mastery of our destiny to take actions that further the economic development of our country. I invite you to join me in assessing the advantages Barbados brings to the international markets in which we do business, our performances in those markets, the obstacles we face, and how we may overcome them and accelerate the pace of economic development over the coming years. Our advantages We are rich in the resources that matter for tourism, international business, culture and other services that can attract business to our shores. These include our equitable climate, our geographical location, our abundant sunshine, the fact that English is our native language, and the physical beauty of our island. We have enhanced our appeal to visitors and investors – and bettered the quality of our own lives – by the investment we have made over the years in health, education, roads, our port and airport, public utilities and our system of law and order. As a result, Barbados has the reputation of being a safe, salubrious country, and it scores highly in indexes of freedom and transparency. Barbados outshines most of the competition in the majority of global indexes which offer comparisons among countries. We are Number One in Latin America and the Caribbean in The Global Innovation Index, published by the UN World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and others; first in the Caribbean in The Global Tourism Competitiveness Report, published by the World Economic Forum; and second only to Panama in the Caribbean and Central America in The Global Competitiveness Report, published by the same body. Among factors which work to Barbados’ advantage are the quality of our institutions, our Social Partnership, the relative development of our business and financial markets, local internet penetration and international connectivity. The quality of life in Barbados is high, attested to by the Human Development Report, published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In recent reports Barbados is credited with high human development, an indication that in terms of what our salaries will buy, as well as educational and health status, Barbadians live as well as people do in some advanced countries. We have all but eliminated dilapidation in housing, access to electricity, water and sanitation is universal, and homelessness has been reduced to a level that many rich countries would envy. We have our very wealthy, and our poor people, but on the whole we are a remarkably egalitarian society. Our economic performance The Barbados economy runs on foreign exchange, as I have often said. We live quite well, by international standards, by selling the goods and services we produce at competitive prices for 
   2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  foreign currency, and using that foreign currency to import everything we need for our modern lifestyles. Our main focus is therefore always on the activities that earn us foreign exchange: tourism and related activities, international business and financial services, and rum, chemicals and a few other manufactured goods. There is one sector where we have the potential to increase output without the use of foreign exchange, and it is in the energy sector. Every day in Barbados we produce far more energy than we could possibly use, but almost all of it is completely wasted, because it is in the form of heat generated on our roofs and other surfaces that absorb and reflect the sun’s rays. We currently harvest a small amount to heat water. However, affordable photovoltaic systems now provide an opportunity to businesses and middle class households to generate all their electricity needs. Of course, we would need a means of supplying electricity at night. It has been shown that with a combination of solar and wind energy, plus biofuels and storage, Barbados could become self-sufficient in electricity generation. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to pass up. Barbados’ tourism is rising to the challenges of the 21st century. The Barbados brand is highly regarded, and developments in the sector have largely enhanced the quality and appeal of the Barbadian tourism product. The visitor experience has been enhanced by top quality sports, dining, shopping, music, culture and heritage. Our visitors are in search of authentic experiences, and we continue to enrich our offerings in ways that are Barbadian and Caribbean, which Barbadians can also enjoy. The strength of the Barbados International Business and Financial Centre is that it is focussed on attracting international companies to set up businesses of substance in Barbados, to employ Barbadian skills to perform tasks of various kinds for their international operations. We offer a strong network of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) and Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs), and a world-class regulatory framework. Why would companies want to do these activities in Barbados rather than in Toronto, New York or Luxembourg? The advantages mentioned above are the obvious answer, plus the fact that the skills these companies need cost less in Barbados than in their home countries. The Barbadian manufactured products which command significant export sales are those which have achieved a name for themselves. Chief among them are our branded rums. Our producers of chemical products for household use have also been successful in racking up sales in the Caribbean region. The obstacles we face If Barbados were fully to realise the plans and projects currently being implemented or under serious discussion in tourism, international business, sugar and its products, and in alternative energy, the country’s sustained growth rate rises to 5 percent or more. In contrast, Central Bank’s current projection for growth is no more than 2 percent in two years’ time. The difference could be transformative: at 5 percent per annum GDP doubles every 15 years; at 2 percent it takes 35 years. The measures that make the difference are within the purview of all of us, and do not depend critically on any external circumstance. It is important to persist with and complete the process of fiscal consolidation, to reduce the ratio of debt to GDP, eliminate Government arrears and restore Government’s international credit worthiness. In this way, periodic apprehensions about the Central Bank’s ability to defend the value of our currency on the interbank market become a thing of the past, and the investment community will have a resurgence of confidence. The quality and efficiency of our public services needs to be very significantly upgraded. The inefficiency of our bureaucracy is at the top of the list of factors that inhibit business activity in Barbados. 
   BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  A priority item for attention by the Social Partnership is the ever widening gap between unit labour costs and the average worker’s contribution to output. We live in a globally competitive world, and the engines of our growth will not perform at their best if worker productivity and engagement does not improve significantly. We must close the gap that has worsened over more than a decade, and achieve productivity gains that can be shared with workers. Ongoing reviews of the incentive regimes for private investment are necessary to ensure that the overall thrust of government policy continues to provide incentives for investment in foreign earning activities and in green energy solutions. Also, we should ensure that incentives that have served us well, such as duty free imports of computers, are maintained, and that any remaining inconsistencies in the incentive regime are removed. The bottom line Barbadians remain firmly in charge of our own destinies, and we have the resources and talent to realise a path to a future of greater prosperity. That path does involve some tough challenges: in too many areas we are not up to speed with the finest services and products that are on offer in the industrialised world, and outmoded and inefficient processes will need to be discarded. Our own collective decisions on the timing of these inevitable changes will determine the extent of our economic success, and the speed with which we are able to improve the livelihoods of all Barbadians. Faster growth increases the size of the pie to be shared among everyone; that must be our focus. 
   Timothy Lane: Inflation targeting – a matter of time Remarks by Mr Timothy Lane, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the CFA Society Atlantic Canada, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 27 October 2015. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for inviting me to speak to you here in Halifax. In my remarks today, I want to take you inside the Bank of Canada and walk you through our monetary policy decision making. In particular, I want to discuss how we take into account the dimension of time. Let’s start with a very basic reality: all Canadians make choices in the present that we know will have consequences far into the future. Anyone who makes a decision on whether to take a job, pursue further education, buy a house or save for retirement has to form a view of what the results will be. Businesses deciding whether to hire more workers, expand their plant and equipment, seek new customers, adjust their prices, or finance their operations face a similar reality. As CFAs, you know that time is at the centre of every financial decision you make or advise on. The Bank of Canada’s mandate – to deliver low, stable and predictable inflation – is fundamentally rooted in the importance of time. Our job is to make sure that those longer-term decisions are not wrong-sided by unexpected changes to the value of money. The confidence Canadians have in their money can’t be taken for granted: it’s something we work hard to achieve and maintain. When we look around the world or even back over Canadian experience, we see many cases in which either high inflation – or its opposite, deflation – has had damaging, or sometimes even devastating, effects. The second aspect of time that we have to address is that, for the Bank of Canada too, our short-term decisions have long-term results. To achieve a good inflation outcome, we need to make decisions on our policy interest rate in the short run – every six weeks. These decisions influence how the economy and inflation will evolve over a much longer period. As you know, six weeks can be a long time for the economy and the markets. We approach each decision with a vast set of new information. To start with, inflation itself can fluctuate, both for fundamental reasons and as a result of various temporary and one-off factors. In addition, we receive all kinds of other economic data from Canada and the economies that affect us; financial market and commodity price data; as well as many relevant news items about economic policies, foreign conflicts and even the weather. So how do we react to all that information – without overreacting – and keeping our eyes on the prize? I hope you aren’t disappointed that I won’t tell you what we will do next. To tell the truth, I don’t really know. A lot can happen between now and our next policy announcement on December 2! What I will do is spell out the logic of our approach – how we think about the underlying trend in inflation and how we make sense of the stream of information coming in. The test of time Let’s start with some background on our inflation-targeting framework. Canada’s decision in 1991 to set a target for inflation did not come out of the blue: it was a product of two decades of unacceptably high and variable inflation. During the 1970s and 1980s, inflation became part of everyone’s calculations. Adjustments for inflation were a contentious element in wage negotiations. Interest rates rose into high double digits, building in a premium for the high expected rate of inflation and the uncertainty around it. High and variable inflation also had very different effects on different groups: some BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   saw their salaries, savings and pensions erode away, while others reaped windfalls on their houses and financial investments. For most of that period, Canada’s monetary policy struggled to find a clear direction. Half a century ago, it was anchored by the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates.1 That system collapsed in the early 1970s in the face of increasingly open financial markets and contradictory policies in the United States and other major economies. In the mid-1970s, Canada, like many other advanced economies, tried targeting the rate of growth of the money supply. This approach was based on extensive research showing that inflation tended to be associated with increases in the supply of money in the economy. But with deregulation and financial innovation, the relationship between the rate of expansion of the money supply and the rate of inflation proved unstable. Money supply targets were no longer viable and were abandoned in 1982. Before and after that money-targeting period, the Bank of Canada had no clear policy framework to guide monetary policy actions and anchor the public’s expectations of inflation. Inflation rose higher as monetary policy reacted by accommodating the inflationary pressures coming from commodity prices, fiscal deficits and higher inflation in other countries. While inflation was eventually tamed during the 1980s, it was a long and arduous process that came at the cost of several years of sub-par economic growth. In 1991, recognizing the importance of inflation to the economic and financial well-being of Canadians and the central role of monetary policy in controlling inflation in the longer run, the Bank began pursuing an explicit target for inflation. The results have been impressive. Since 1991, inflation in Canada, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), has been remarkably stable. Inflation has averaged 2 per cent (Chart 1), and its variability has fallen by roughly two-thirds. Canadians have benefited in a number of important ways. Greater price stability has allowed consumers and businesses to manage their affairs with greater certainty about the future purchasing power of their incomes and financial assets. Real and nominal interest rates have also been lower across a range of maturities, in part, because they no longer include a substantial premium to compensate investors for inflation risk. More broadly, low, stable and predictable inflation has facilitated more stable economic growth in Canada and lower and less-variable unemployment (Table 1). Our inflation-targeting regime has also stood the test of the 2007–09 global financial crisis. As the fallout was hitting the Canadian economy, the Bank of Canada responded. We eased monetary policy aggressively to forestall a deeper and more prolonged economic slump. Inflation targeting gave us the flexibility to allow that strong policy response. It provided an analytical framework for calibrating how far we should go, and for how long. It also anchored the public’s confidence that, despite the extreme conditions of that period, policies would remain on track to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. A particularly useful feature of our inflation-targeting framework is that, every five years, we renew our agreement with the federal government. The agreement sets the target for inflation and the parameters for achieving it. And the renewal process provides the opportunity and the discipline to reassess our approach in a systematic way and look for room for improvement. But the bar for any major change is high. We know that inflation targeting has turned out to be far superior to any other framework that has been tried. Also, as I have stressed, part of 1 Canada adhered to Bretton Woods for only part of the post-war period. See M. Bordo, T. Gomes and L. Schembri, “Canada and the IMF: Trailblazer or Prodigal Son?” Discussion Paper 2009–1, Bank of Canada, 2009; and D. Dodge, “The Evolving International Monetary Order and the Need for an Evolving IMF” (speech to Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton, New Jersey, 30 March 2006). 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches                                                  
   the purpose of a monetary policy framework is to allow Canadians to make longer-term decisions without having to worry too much about inflation – and that argues against changing our framework unless it’s really necessary. A matter of time Let’s now look at time and the way in which it enters into how we target inflation. Targeting inflation involves important challenges, because we don’t control inflation directly. Normally, we influence inflation through our policy interest rate – more precisely, a target for the overnight interbank rate. Our policy rate affects other interest rates in the economy, overall financial conditions and, in turn, the economy at large. It affects inflation through the amount of excess demand or supply in the economy – the output gap – which can generate pressures for inflation or disinflation. The exchange rate and expectations can also play important roles in transmitting the effects of monetary policy to inflation. There can be long lags in this transmission process – and these lags can vary significantly, depending on the economic context. Total inflation can be “noisy” because many temporary sector-specific factors impinge on inflation in the short run and, in many cases, are quickly reversed (Chart 2). Some examples are consumer energy prices such as gasoline prices, or prices of certain food products that may fluctuate because of weather and other factors. In Canada, for example, 90 per cent of the observed monthly variations in the CPI are linked to price changes in just eight categories of goods and services, which together amount to only about one-seventh of the whole CPI basket. There are many examples of such temporary factors, but let me take just one. In the early 2000s, auto insurance premiums soared by about 30 per cent over a span of one year. By itself, this one component of the CPI basket was adding a full percentage point to inflation (Chart 3).2 This outcome was not reflective of broader inflationary processes. In this setting, we can’t hit our inflation target precisely or continuously – and we don’t try to. To illustrate, consider what would happen if we raised our policy rate mechanically whenever inflation was above target and lowered it whenever inflation was below target. We would end up reacting to a lot of temporary factors. And because our policies work with long lags, we would have to overreact, making huge adjustments in our policy rate to have any effect, followed by huge corrections to compensate for the lagged effects of our own policies. This would lead to what has been called “instrument instability” – a kind of policy over-steering that would quickly land us in the ditch. This reasoning points us in two directions. First, we need to be able to look through temporary factors that affect inflation in the short run, so that we don’t overreact to shocks that are going to reverse themselves anyway. Second, we need to understand and anticipate the forces that will affect inflation in the future so that our policy decisions will keep inflation on target until their effects have worked their way through the economy. Both of these elements go into making a judgment on the underlying trend in inflation and how it is evolving. So, rather than trying to hit the inflation target continuously, we set a time horizon for reaching it. Normally it’s two years, based on estimates of what is a reasonable time frame for policies to have their effects and for temporary shocks to dissipate. 2 M. Khan, L. Morel and P. Sabourin, “A Comprehensive Evaluation of Measures of Core Inflation for Canada,” Discussion Paper No. 2015–12, Bank of Canada, 2015.

   But we have the flexibility to return sooner or to take longer, depending on the nature of the shocks affecting the economy. In particular, under flexible inflation targeting, we have the scope to take longer to get back to target in a situation where returning to target within two years would require aggressive policies that could result in a buildup of imbalances in our financial system and possible instability down the road. This point was made explicit in our inflation-targeting framework the last time we renewed it in 2011. The timing for a return to target thus requires a judgment on the balance of risks. Even when inflation is at target, we can’t afford to be complacent. Sometimes there are forces pushing inflation higher or lower, and we need to use monetary policy to counteract them. In such cases, the policy rate will need to deviate from its long-run level to provide the stimulus or restraint necessary to offset these forces.3  There are also some situations in which we need to get ahead of shocks that we can see will have a significant effect on inflation in the future. Otherwise, we would be in a situation of trying to catch up with these effects after they have already become entrenched. That was the logic of our January 2015 rate cut. We could see that a 60 per cent decline in the price of oil would, on balance, be bad for the Canadian economy. So even though it was still uncertain how large and prolonged that effect would be, we needed to act promptly to achieve our inflation target. The combination of long- and short-run factors affecting inflation, the lags in the effects of our policies, and the uncertainties around each element makes monetary policy fundamentally an exercise in risk management. While one can try to write a reaction function or rule to describe monetary policy, a rule or function can only go so far. For example, the Taylor rule holds that monetary authorities adjust the policy rate in response to deviations of the inflation rate from target and output from potential. That’s a useful rule of thumb, but too mechanical to go very far in explaining how policy actually behaves. Inflation targeting is also “informationally inclusive,” meaning it doesn’t just react to the current inflation rate and GDP. It also takes account of a broad range of other information. That information includes economic data as well as soft information such as the responses to our Business Outlook Survey and a wide range of more informal conversations that we conduct with businesses and other Canadians. We use a combination of models and our own judgment to understand the underlying forces working on inflation. We want to get as clear a picture as possible, not only of what is actually going on, but also of what could go wrong if the unexpected happened. Underlying inflation In thinking about targeting inflation over time, an aspect that has received a lot of attention recently is underlying inflation: the inflation rate that would prevail in the absence of various sector-specific and one-off factors that can affect the measured CPI from month to month. Conceptually, underlying inflation should be driven mainly by the amount of excess supply or demand in the economy, together with the public’s expectations of inflation. Underlying inflation has been a particularly important concept this year. We have the impact of the oil price shock, which is pushing inflation down via prices of gasoline and other consumer energy products. At the same time, the weaker Canadian dollar, which is largely associated with the lower prices of oil and other Canadian commodity exports, has been pushing measured inflation upward. A number of other one-off factors have also been affecting inflation. Our challenge is to distinguish the trend from the temporary to avoid 3 For a more detailed discussion of the use of monetary policy to counteract headwinds or tailwinds, see Technical Box 2, Bank of Canada Monetary Policy Report (July 2011): 28. 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches                                                  
   overreacting to the temporary – and give the public confidence that inflation will return to the right track. For this reason, the Bank of Canada, along with many other central banks, uses a number of measures to calculate core inflation, which are designed to minimize the influence of transitory price movements (Table 2). An effective core measure must have four key properties. It must be less volatile than total inflation; closely track long-run movements in the total CPI (in other words, be “unbiased”); be related to the underlying drivers of inflation, notably the output gap, in order to reliably predict future trend movements in the total CPI; and be easy to understand and explain to the public. Since 2001, the Bank of Canada has featured one measure of core inflation as our operational guide for monetary policy: CPIX, which excludes eight of the most volatile components of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components for the effects of indirect taxes (Chart 4).4 Included in those eight components are mortgage interest costs, which CPIX strips out for a different reason: to avoid giving a perverse reading of the impact of monetary policy on core inflation. (A measure of core inflation that includes mortgage interest costs increases when policy is tightened to bring down inflation.) Another exclusion-based core measure, CPIXFET, takes out food, energy and indirect taxes. Yet others calculate core inflation using a trimmed mean, which excludes different components each month based on whether or not they are exhibiting volatility at that specific point in time. More sophisticated methods track common price movements across categories in the CPI basket. Such movements are more likely to reflect aggregate demand fluctuations than sector-specific developments. The advantage of these tools is that they take information on all the prices in the CPI and use objective methods to filter that information. The disadvantage is that in some cases they are constructed using techniques that, while firmly founded in logic and statistical theory, are very opaque. All the measures have followed similar tracks (Chart 5). Each measure satisfies the key properties identified above to differing degrees. They all display less volatility than total inflation (Chart 6). And all but one track long-run movements in total CPI very closely. While the various measures are correlated with the output gap to differing degrees, they all have some predictive power for total inflation (Chart 7).5  But no formula can completely exclude idiosyncratic factors. We’ve had some examples of those lately with automobile pricing, telecoms, consumer electricity and natural gas. The products that are subject to idiosyncratic factors can change from period to period; obviously, we can’t change our measure each time that happens. Nor should we ignore those sector-specific factors: sometimes, movements in individual prices can be an advance warning of wider price movements, so we have to look at them in the right context. As we prepare for the renewal of our inflation-control agreement with the federal government in 2016, we are examining the properties of these measures of core inflation to determine whether the Bank should continue the practice of identifying one pre-eminent measure as its 4 The excluded items in CPIX are fruit, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest costs, intercity transportation and tobacco products, as well as the effects of changes in indirect taxes such as the GST. 5 All the core measures are generally better predictors of total inflation than total inflation itself. However, none of the measures outperforms a naïve forecast of 2 per cent. BIS central bankers’ speeches 5                                                  
   operational guide and, if so, whether CPIX should continue to play that role. We published today on our website our latest technical assessment of these measures of core inflation.6  Exchange rates and inflation targeting I want now to discuss one factor that can have a particularly important effect on inflation: the exchange rate. Inflation targeting can only work with a flexible exchange rate, which gives the Bank of Canada room to set monetary policy independently of other countries. We don’t target the exchange rate or even publish a forecast. With a floating exchange rate, the external value of the Canadian dollar can change for a variety of reasons, and that affects inflation in Canada through two channels. It has a direct pass-through effect on the prices of imported goods. The exchange rate also affects inflation more indirectly through its impact on aggregate demand in the Canadian economy, mainly through its effects on the competitiveness of Canadian-produced goods and services relative to those produced elsewhere. The pass-through effects are transitory, while the effects on aggregate demand will generally persist over a longer period. The importance of both of these kinds of effects is particularly clear when the change in the exchange rate is as large as it has been recently: in less than two years, the Canadian dollar has lost more than 20 per cent in value against the U.S. dollar. The effect of this depreciation on exports and the real economy is already evident. It has improved the competitiveness of Canadian producers. Export categories that historically have been sensitive to exchange rate movements are showing stronger activity. Examples include building and packaging materials, furniture and fixtures, clothing and textile products, and large motor vehicles (e.g., heavy trucks and buses). Exports of services, which constitute about 15 per cent of total exports, are also benefiting. The pass-through effects are also quite significant. They are estimated to be adding 0.9 to 1.1 percentage points to total CPI inflation (Chart 8).7  So how does monetary policy react? If the change in the exchange rate is seen as a temporary factor reflecting other structural changes, it is clearly appropriate to look through the pass-through effects in assessing underlying inflation and in making policy. That is the case at the present time. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar is driven mainly by two factors. First, it is associated with the sharp decline in Canada’s terms of trade as the prices of oil and other Canadian commodity exports have decreased. These commodity price developments are, in turn, a result of the dynamics of supply and demand for those commodities in a global market, certainly not a result of Canadian monetary policy.8 Second, it is part of the general strengthening of the U. S. dollar as that economy strengthens and the Federal Reserve moves closer to normalizing monetary policy. By that logic, we exclude the direct impact of the pass-through effect of the exchange rate movement in assessing underlying inflation. Therefore, we judge that underlying inflation is around 1.5 to 1.7 per cent. Of course, the effect of the weaker Canadian dollar in stimulating the Canadian economy is an essential element of our projection that underlying inflation will return sustainably to target, with the economy back to its potential, over the next couple of years. 6 M.

   Although we believe that’s the right decision at the present time, it would not always be the right call. There are times, as in the 1970s, when exchange rate movements are part of a broader inflationary process. In such cases, looking through the pass-through could put us on a treadmill of accommodating higher inflation. Moreover, identifying pass-through depends on a combination of estimation and judgment. For that reason, we issue our estimate of the underlying trend in inflation as our own judgment in the current policy context, rather than as an alternative measure of core inflation. Expectations Expectations of inflation, which are based on actual inflation as well as the credibility of our target, also play a central role in the conduct of monetary policy. Many economic decisions depend on expectations of future inflation. For businesses, inflation expectations influence their stance in wage negotiations and price setting, as well as in assessing rates of return for decisions on production, hiring and investing in productive capacity. For households, expectations have an impact on savings decisions as well as on their choice of alternative savings vehicles.9 Through their influence on all of these decisions, expectations tend to become self-fulfilling. It would be much more challenging to keep inflation on target if expectations were to become unanchored – or anchored at a lower or higher level. For these reasons, we keep a close eye on expected inflation. We measure business expectations with our own quarterly Business Outlook Survey and recently began tracking household expectations with a quarterly online poll of 1,000 Canadian consumers. The poll measures both the inflation expectations of participants over various time horizons and the uncertainty surrounding those expectations. It also covers a wide array of other economic expectations that will inform the Bank, and Canadians in general, on issues ranging from labour market prospects to personal finances. Conclusion Let me wrap up. Our inflation-targeting framework has stood the test of time. It has proved vastly superior to any other policy alternatives that have been tried. Our periodic renewals are important opportunities to make sure it continues to serve its purpose and to suggest improvements. I have focused on one set of improvements that we are considering: how we assess the underlying trend in inflation, separating it from price movements that are likely to be temporary. The critical test is the confidence you have that inflation will remain within our target range. We would like the public to take 2 per cent inflation for granted. We don’t, however, take your confidence in us for granted. We know we have to earn your trust by delivering, without fail, on that commitment. 9 A.

   Gent Sejko: Do crises change economic fundamentals in SEE Speech by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the Conference “Do crises change economic fundamentals in SEE?”, hosted by the Bank of Albania, organised in cooperation with the South East European Studies at Oxford, Tirana, 30 October 2015. *      *      * Your Excellency Prime Minister, Dear Governor Hamza and senior central bank representatives, Your excellencies ambassadors, Dear guests, friends and colleagues, I am delighted to welcome you to the annual conference of the Bank of Albania organised in cooperation with the South East Europe Studies at Oxford. It is a pleasure to see that this cooperation brings together old and new partners. This has been a tough year full of challenges for the Albanian economy, consequently for the work of the Bank of Albania. The full recovery of economic growth and its further improvement in the future are and remain one of the top priorities of our work for the year. The prolonged crisis has impelled us and homologous institutions across the world to review many of the economic axioms, which we had taken for granted for a long time. It is not by accident that the main topic of the conference focuses on the causality and solutions for long-term problems we are facing during this period. Over the five year period, the Albanian economy has been growing in positive territory, yet, below its potential. This is a global phenomenon in the post-crisis period, extending across the entire South East Europe, which have experienced even lower growth rates. I hope that during this conference we will have the opportunity to analyse in depth the reasons behind this situation, sources that feed it and the difficulties it imposes on the business model and financial intermediation. Furthermore, it would be useful to discuss on the options available to policymakers and the way out of this situation, which, I believe, is a temporary situation rather than a long-term economic equilibrium. The Bank of Albania has been actively using two main instruments, the monetary policy and macro-prudential one, to give its contribution for a swift and systematic closure of the negative output gap in Albania. The Bank has continued to implement an accommodative monetary policy lowering the key interest rate to the historic 2% level. Notwithstanding the scepticism that has accompanied this process, the lowering of the key interest rate is reflected in a wide range of interest rates in the financial market, including those on loans and government securities. The fact the economy continues to grow below its potential, does not necessarily reflect the absence of an effective transmission channel for the monetary policy. We are more and more convinced that, above all, we have a weak aggregate demand, which is not generating the much needed stimuli for the recovery of the economic activity. Recent data, however, render us more optimistic. The real sector is showing signs of constant recovery, corroborated by some positive developments in the external economy. I would like to underline that a clearer prospect of the political and economic situation in Greece will have a positive impact over the upcoming period. The Bank of Albania has been continuously monitoring the developments in our Southern neighbour, aware of the various risks that could spill over in the Albanian economy. But, thanks to the precise and duly interventions, especially in the banking sector, these risks never materialised. BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  
   The constant easing of the monetary policy seems to be reflected especially in investment indicators, with the domestic and foreign ones showing significant improvement over the first half of the year. On our side, we are happy that these investments were not only due to public sector interventions. There was also a substantial component by the private sector. This makes us believe that well-studied projects by the investors, coupled with an increasingly sound and pro-investment business climate, will serve as main drivers for the economy towards not only higher but also more sustainable growth in the near future. In accordance with the best contemporary practices, the Bank of Albania has endeavoured to enhance the transparency in its communication with the public, not only about the actual decisions but also about our forecasts. The Bank of Albania has constantly conveyed to the economic agents the idea that the monetary policy will remain accommodative and will sustain the revitalisation of the economy. As a result, we hope that the forward guidance on the monetary policy stance of the Bank of Albania will be adequately understood by all market agents and the public. Banks and entrepreneurs should use this opportunity to boost their activity resting assured that the central bank will continue to sustain and support their activity. In addition to the monetary policy easing, the Bank of Albania has paid special attention to the reform in the financial sector and the prudent supervision of the banking sector. The Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Ms. Yellen, in a statement not long ago leaves no doubt about the necessity of reforms in the financial sector, I quote “... a sine qua non for sustained economic recovery following a financial crisis is a thoroughgoing repair of the financial system.” From the perspective, in cooperation with the Parliament, government and other public regulatory entities we have undertaken a series of legislative and regulatory initiatives, aimed at creating incentives for the recovery and assurance in lending. Thanks to the reforms we have undertaken during this year, we have started to reap the first positive results as regards the situation of the non-performing loans. As a result, the ratio of the non-performing loans fell for the first time after almost seven years of continuous rise. The write off of loss loans, as I have explained in previous statements, was the finalisation of joint inter-institutional efforts. During this process, we have been assisted and overseen also by important international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Beyond the non-performing loans issue, the banking system continued to be well capitalised, liquid and financially sound. The issue of non-performing loans will require some more time to resolve, but this should not keep us from the recovery of the credit activity at home. For as long the positive performance of the other above-mentioned indicators continues, the banking sector has room and the potential to credit convincing projects and investments. In my judgement, it is important to administer with courage and persistence the prevalent perception that non-performing loan have forced banks to adopt a very conservative approach to lending. To permanently address this problem, additional measures have been taken and will be taken in the future. I would like to briefly focus on the latest initiative in this regard: a coordinated plan between the Bank of Albania, Government of Albania, Association of Banks, and International Monetary Fund, consisting in two main pillars: The first pillar relates to the drafting and completing the legislation that regulates lending from the moment of concluding a contract until the final repayment, including disputes among the parties. These changes aim at making more precise in legal terms all procedures related to banking activity, bailiff services, borrowers and other relevant state institutions. The second pillar is related to the regulatory framework of the activity of the banking system, therefore, related to the day to day activity of the Bank of Albania and the banking system. 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  
   We have identified the regulations that will be subject to amendments. In addition to the objective for creating higher flexibility in relation to certain aspects of the activity in the treatment of the credit portfolio, we will aim at adopting a new concept: the “background check (biografi)” of the client in relation to bank borrowing. We believe that this new element will help banks assess the borrowing potential of each client. In spite of what I said above, it is a fact that, recently, lending in the national currency has seen positive growth over the months. This phenomenon, among others, has been accompanied with a positive side effect at a higher speed and intensity in the pass through mechanism of the monetary policy in the economy. Dear guests, As I pointed out, at the beginning, economic activity at home remains in a positive trajectory, but it has not yet reached the level we wish it were. Research at the Bank continues to confirm that the Albanian economy has unutilised potential and that the closing of the gap remains the main challenge for policymakers. Interventions through both the monetary policy and macro-prudential elements insofar have not succeeded to definitively close the gap. I listed these facts intentionally as the conference of this year is called “Do crisis change economic fundamentals?” These interventions are main actions central banks are allowed by the legislation, and recommended by the most modern theory. If these interventions fail to introduce a long-term positive equilibrium for the economy, then a question arises naturally: what else should be done? The answer is in the phrase “structural reforms”. While the phrase may have often been speculated, the truth firmly confirms: only the willingness to project and undertake courageous and visionary reforms is the golden key to success”. This fact was strongly emphasised in the final statement of the Ministers of Finance and central bank Governors of 24 most developed nations, (Financial Committee of the IMF) in the annual meeting of the IMF organised earlier this month in Lima, Peru. A secure sustainable long-term growth requires timely-implemented and well-sequenced structural reforms which remain critical to raise productivity, potential output, and living standards; they should bolster confidence in the economy and reduce social inequality. Concluding, I would like to underline the support of the Bank of Albania for a series of reforms undertaken recently as part of the medium-term agreement between the Government of Albania, Bank of Albania and the International Monetary Fund. Similarly to the rest of South East Europe, Albania needs a new path, in which investors will be able to see again profit opportunities. It is vital for all of us, for the region to detach itself as fast as possible from the perception as an irrelevant geographical areas, fragmented, with insignificant human, financial and economic potentials. We should do anything it takes, at any cost, to restore once again the trend and vitality this region showed before the crisis. Thank You! BIS central bankers’ speeches 3
