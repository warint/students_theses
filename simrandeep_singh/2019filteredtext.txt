 françois villeroy de galhau: the euro area - stay coursethrough uncertaintiesintroductory remark mr françois villeroy de galhau, governor bank france, thebank france symposium & 34th suerf colloquium occasion 20th anniversaryof euro, paris, 28 march 2019.* * *good afternoon everyone welcome paris. this 34 suerf colloquium butalso 10 banque de france international symposium. it also marc-olivier’s lastsymposium i would like warmly thank team suerf banque defrance hard work. i also wish express gratitude speaker moderatorsas key player “staying course uncertainties”. in open remark i willmodestly describe different type uncertainty discuss possible implication forpolicy. **1 – there actually four different type uncertaintywe often talk uncertainty single phenomenon. there are, however, multiplesources form uncertainty different implication policy maker andshould respond. to introduce discussion next two days, i mention four ofthem.first, “current state” uncertaintyone form uncertainty grapple time completely sure weare economically. so-called soft data, survey sentiment indicators, marketsignals always align hard official statistic generally know somedelay. statistical technique exist try combine source together “nowcast” butthe error band around central estimate still quite wide. they also cannot deal withone difficult problems: make so-called “idiosyncratic factors”? forinstance, extent recent stutter german economy due car industry andto new emission standard low level rhine possibly climate change?these hard judgement make. second, “future path” uncertaintyif unsure are, even le certain going, mostobviously shock cannot precisely predict. a potential slowdown china ordifferent choice brexit – discus today – two examples.economic dynamic also drive underlie momentum difficult gauge. be therecent growth slowdown temporary persist? a temporary slowdown is, know, thebase case ecb, recently revise staff macroeconomic projection realgdp growth substantially 2019 slightly 2020.third, “strategic” uncertaintyin cases, uncertainty face policy maker do. this isparticularly pernicious unpredictability consider source strategic advantage. forinstance, seemingly credible threat one party take action lead mutualdisadvantage prompt concession other, (or not). a former american president,thth 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech richard nixon, call “mad man” theory apply war vietnam thereare echo idea current international trade disputes. such behaviour underminesmultilateralism important source stability growth many decades. ifstrategic uncertainty source unilateral advantage, dissipate remain sourceof latent policy risk.last, “structural change monetary policy” uncertaintythere fundamental structural change occurring, notably euro area economy alsoelsewhere, poorly understood. the ongoing demographic transition, example, ischanging employment, investment save decisions, probably low naturalrate interest.the monetary policy transmission mechanism also seem changing. a sustain period ofaccommodative monetary policy boost growth employment finally show upin nominal wage growth: first part phillips curve work. but high nominal wageshave yet pass core inflation. it eventually, pertinentissues – much – unclear. there is, thus, single mechanicalrelationship monetary policy instrument inflation, rather distribution likelyresponses. furthermore, difference demographic trend structural policy choicesbetween country eurozone (or state us) may create perpetuate someheterogeneity across large monetary areas, issue discus tomorrow morning.2 – how respond uncertainties?without pre-empting discussions, let flag possible responses.i’ll first, address issue policy uncertainty central bankers. so far, is,fortunately, simple one: so-called “game chicken” clarity policyintentions beneficial all. the frequent exchange bis,g7, g20 even event symposium, valuable create mutual trust avoidthe possibility large policy surprises. our monetary policy independent, rightly so, butthey concert commit avoid currency wars. clarity reactionfunctions clearly also extend financial market public large.second, could respond current state future path uncertainty? the textbookanswer, date back theil tinbergen, work best guess act youare completely sure. this sometimes describe certainty-equivalent approach. thereare, however, symmetry assumption type model necessary hold realworld. uncertainty around central projection may skew one direction.applying certainty-equivalence approach also assume upside error regardedequally downside errors. but give inflation still objective, market-based long-term inflation expectations, upside shock would welcome equivalentdownside shock present.let point add word negative rate follow remark lisbon lastfebruary, state obvious: march 2019, long march 2016 wecut dfr –0.40%. this gap time two consequences:first, were, time, significant deflationary risks, decide accordingly astrong calibration monetary answers. a deflationary risk receded,there obviously reason go negative interest rates.second, three year evidence combine effect variousunconventional monetary tools, include negative rates, financial intermediation theirimpact transmission monetary policy – combine effect might 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech evolve time. so mario draghi rightly stress need monitor thebank lend channel reflect possible measure take preserve thefavourable implication negative rate economy, mitigate possible sideeffects.knightian uncertainty different situation, assign probability feasible, isa concept anyone try forecast recent outcome house common wouldinstantly recognise. in situations, usually argue best strategy try avoidthe bad outcomes, do prepare no-deal brexit. and sometimes needto bold avoid truly bad outcomes, exactly mario draghi say euro-system would “whatever takes”.third, respond uncertainty structural relationships? uncertainty thetransmission mechanism often use justify act gradually. sometimes describe as“tiptoeing dark room”, central banker follow brainard principle attenuate hisresponse inflationary shock uncertain precise sensitivity inflation tomonetary policy. but cautious first step, ready totake several additional steps: gradualism inaction.structural shift economy also constantly change economic dynamic andequilibrium relationships, r* (the natural rate interest) u* (the natural rate ofunemployment). but john williams new york feed point out, star aretoday fuzzy blur single bright point light. so whilst help broadorientation monetary policy, uncertainty star wide permit precisenavigation.overall, therefore, theoretical guidance respond uncertainty open, saythe least. my understand present debate lead follow four pragmaticsuggestions i hope stimulate discussions:1. remain clear objective – uncertain time right one createadditional doubt about, say, inflation target – capacity anddetermination use tool predicable sequence.2. but, whilst consistent guidance, flexible precise calendar andcalibration implementation. in short, predictable possible, never beprecommitted.3. act prevent bad outcome occur without supply complete insurance,which would create moral hazard.4. never base policy one expect path economy. in conclusion, cannot seek control, avoid, uncertainty; instead must implementstrategies robust it. the french philosopher edgar morin put nicely: “laconnaissance progresse en intégrant l’incertitude, non en l’exorcisant” – “knowledge advancesby integrate uncertainty, exorcise it”.with mind, let wish productive symposium lively enlighteningexchanges views. christine, floor yours. 3 / 3bis central bankers' speech 2 the terrace, po box 2498, wellington

condition time ecbdecided implement unconventional measures.the euro area economy undergo double-dip recession. inflation outcome flirt withdeflation, sign inflation expectation become de-anchored. thetransmission monetary policy across whole euro area impaired. fiscal policy offeredlittle way countercyclical stabilisation. traditional monetary policy reach limits,with nominal interest rate close zero contemporary measure real equilibriuminterest rate zero.the choice ecb time stark. we could either restrict conventional123456 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech monetary policy, fail fulfil price stability mandate. or could implementunconventional measures, respect mandate.i would argue real choice.the treaty afford u broad discretion choice tool honour price stabilitymandate. but offer discretion whatsoever choice whether fulfil thatmandate. these condition central bank independence sustainable.that essence first watchword – necessity. by carry monetary policy use arange additional tool legally available u – use successfully centralbanks advance economy – ecb support recovery help ensure sustainedadjustment path inflation. we would manage without unconventionalmeasures. i believe central bank independence sustainable unelectedbureaucrats refuse take action necessary honour legal mandate.it true tool unpopular, central bank strange tounpopularity. indeed, act best interest long-term prosperity always popular,monetary policy could safely leave hand politicians.proportionalitybut necessity mean action justify pursue price stability mandate?the short answer no.policymakers need take account impact tool primarypurpose, also potential side effects. policy need maintain proportionality – secondwatchword today.proportionality one basic legal principle architecture european union. it isenshrined foundational treaty demand content form union actionshould exceed necessary achieve objective treaties. for monetarypolicy, proportionality imply ecb’s action must, first, suitable address theidentified risk price stability. second, ecb’s measure must necessary achievetheir intend objective. in words, alternative monetary policy measure entail morelimited action would enable objective achieve effectively rapidly. third,proportionality stricto sensu imply expect benefit ecb’s action mustoutweigh costs.these principle provide hierarchy tools, unconventional measure beused conventional measure exhausted.let address, then, criticism distributional consequence unconventionalmonetary policy undermine central bank independence.it worth recall monetary policy always distributional effects.cutting short-term interest rate tend reduce income saver boost income ofdebtors wealth asset holders. it also affect income macroeconomiceffects employment wages. in short, conventional monetary policy havedistributional effects, partly work cause them. in normal times, effect areviewed secondary importance aggregate welfare benefit price

coveremployment.the ecb also attempt minimise unwanted side effect carefully design tools. forexample, become clear asset purchase programme (app) contribute tochallenging condition repo market. by

monetarypolicy discussion govern council.the takeover bank supervision accompany additional far-reachingaccountability obligations, interinstitutional agreement european parliamentand number memoranda understand institutions. a separation principle wasestablished; supervision broad regulatory power like monetary policy.so unconventional measure undoubtedly side effects, essential point thatthese side effect manifestly disproportionate primary objective measure –contributing price stability. but continuously monitor ongoing appropriateness ofour measure order preserve balance cost benefits. and thegrowing number new tool activity move action central bank close toother policy realms, boundary never cross – confirm european court ofjustice. therefore, use measure crisis represent break withthe framework justify central bank independence.but continue ass impact measures, negative interest rate inparticular, area bank profitability, consider whether mix policymeasures remain suitable proportionate.probitymy final watchword refer policymakers conduct policy, personal conduct.at time increase external pressure central banks, important policymakers actwith probity.the treaty afford significant personal independence member ecb’s governingcouncil. these provision play vital role unique institutional framework, since monetarypolicy must appropriate euro area-wide conditions, may different theconditions policymaker’s home country. by provide strong protection sit governingcouncil members, treaty aim isolate political pressure.these protection also come obligation act

high court confirm unconventional measure take ecb werelegal, subjective – albeit erroneous – impression breach mandate enough totrigger increase political pressure.the best protection – unjustified –

vulnerability inthe global financial system develop strong regulatory supervisory policy createa resilient global financial system pursuit financial stability. our broad mandate hasconsiderable overlap field jmcb cover within pages. the fsb include 24jurisdictions 73 representatives, include member g20. also similar thejmcb, fsb celebrate anniversary year, creation occur 10 yearsago. we far cry jmcb’s 50 years, i hope time continue work—andnot response late crisis—will prove valuable enough one day merit asimilar celebration.i especially please speak conference today fsb welcome andencourages participation academic community tackle issue global financialstability. i would like see great direct contribution academic subject-matterexperts work. you may notice fsb send call nomination lastmonth academic advise work evaluate post-crisis reforms—in particularinstance, evaluation examine effect too-big-to-fail reform package theg20 endorse 2010 fsb standard setter implement sincethen. in initiative examine consequence post-crisis reform, academiccommunity help advance field analytical tool critical insight.the financial crisis expose fault line financial system addressedimmediately, comprehensively, vigorously. the body post-crisis regulation resultedwas found work academics, include important paper publish jmcb, andinvolved energy effort many standard

basel iii final, largestglobal bank substantially capital liquidity, over-the-counter derivative marketsare safer, step take address risk too-big-to-fail institutions. throughgreater monitor policy measures, fsb address risk nonbank financialintermediation. and remarkable progress difficult unglamorous task ofestablishing workable resolution regime consistent fsb’s clearly definedprinciples. while must still work ensure full, timely, consistent implementation theagreed reforms, time fsb turn energy attention future.in time today, i would like two things. first, i would like share myview work fsb must evolve merit future celebration someof core principle i think inform work. after discuss principles, i wantto focus attention work priority fsb address throughout2019 beyond, include nonbank financing, fintech, evaluate too-big-to-fail reforms.core principle 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech let turn core principles—engagement, rigor, analysis. these core principlesreflect goal inward outward looking. from within, fsb member theoccasion reflect work executed—that is, must ask canaccomplish mission effectively, improve financial sector’s ability supporteconomic growth without threaten financial stability. outwardly, endeavor reach outto great number constituent stakeholder input important financialstability issue encountering. this also good time inform wide public audienceon nature mission clear, articulate, jargon-free manner.engagementas fsb pivot away urgency post-crisis reform development, opportunetime improve effort effective engagement. recognize wide-reaching effect itswork, fsb must seek input broad range stakeholders, bring adifferent perspective issue consideration. while directly accountable theg20, are, g20, accountable people affect actions. in myview, mean must engage genuine, substantial dialogue stakeholders,to great effective degree past.to start, strengthen role six regional group part fsborganization. in 2011, fsb establish six consultative group represent large region ofthe globe—the americas, europe, middle east north africa, sub-saharan africa, thecommonwealth independent states, asia. the intent expand outreach programbeyond membership systematic manner good reflect fsb’s global mission. eachgroup meet twice year help fsb obtain broad input policydevelopment agenda. these group re-engineered promote implementationof international policy initiative within respective regions, also strong positionto keep abreast development financial market thus inform fsb policy. we haveinitiated study operation regional group help inform u way toupgrade effectiveness outreach feedback mechanism. i particularly interestedin take lesson learn study move forward enhancedengagement.engagement outside fsb also important mission. we currently engage withbusinesses, institutions, market participants, academic much fsb work. forexample, past conduct public consultation fsb policy recommendations,albeit sometimes short timetables. we establish expectation publicconsultation least 60 days. we need give public adequate time comment onfsb proposals, can, times, quite complex.beyond public consultation, must convene meet private sector andacademic community build robust meaningful dialogue. for example, kickedoff work undertake behest japanese g20 presidency studydifferences regulatory environment market condition across jurisdiction may havefinancial stability implications—often refer “market fragmentation"—by host aworkshop key stakeholder academics. this quite successful, i look forward tosuch interaction rule. in addition, need improve interaction cooperationwith standard-setting bodies, basel committee, committee paymentsand market infrastructure, international association insurance supervisors, theinternational organization security commission (iosco). while work togetherin past, owe global community seek opportunity improvedcooperation engagement.to improve fsb transparency, take number important steps. for example, onfebruary 12, 2019, fsb publish comprehensive work program website year1 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech ahead. this first time fsb’s history work program disseminatedpublicly. over term chairmanship, i continue look step allow allstakeholders open window fsb’s decisionmaking process products.i believe improve transparency fsb process critical mission. i’m remind oflord hewart’s famous—and oft-quoted—remark concern importance jurisprudence tothe public: “not must justice done; must also see done.” we ableto apply concept field global financial standard setting.rigorous vigilancethe second principle i would like discus concern ass mitigate vulnerabilitiesin global financial system. the post-crisis reform address fault line lead thecrisis contagion effect felt around world, never replace need forvigilance. if rigorously vigilant, still risk another crisis. what need forward-looking methodology use advance analytical tool spot vulnerability well inadvance lead widespread financial distress economic costs. here theacademic community continue contribute cutting-edge robust modelingtechniques.we mitigate financial vulnerability identify accurately timelymanner. a such, fsb’s stand committee assessment vulnerability theleadership fsb vice chair klaas knot dutch national bank direct aconsiderable amount energy develop cutting-edge framework identification andassessment financial vulnerabilities. again, principle transparency engagement willshape work group. it important wide spectrum financial participant bebrought process, bank nonbank financial institution financial regulator tonational authority multilateral standard-setting body broad academic community.this task essential mission fsb; financial development move rapid pace,and able quickly accurately ass vulnerability essential take actionto prevent future crises.analysisfinally, fsb member must employ critical eye toward effect regulation thathave put place. many reform place long enough beevaluated. we judge whether reform intend effect make thefinancial system resilient. be regulatory reform cause unintended, adverse effects?can achieve same, strong level financial resilience reform efficient,simple, transparent, tailored? the fsb must champion efficient effective regulation inorder maintain public support progress made.key piece fsb’s work plannow i would like turn three prominent issue fsb’s agenda 2019. i start withtwo relatively new issue continue evolve grow sophistication: nonbank financingand fintech, i turn important work begin evaluate effect ofreforms aim end big fail.fintechi loosely define fintech technology-enabled financial innovation result materialchanges provision financial services. a often case technological innovationmeets establish business, fintech attract great deal attention, range utopianclaims hostile skepticism. claim fintech’s promise abound: power andpotential reduce economic inequality, increase financial inclusion, boost economic growth.1 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech through introduction new methodologies, great information curation, reduction inprocessing costs, fintech could potentially reduce financial volatility vulnerabilities.we already see significant change many people around world obtain financialservices. for example, kenya, mobile payment technology introduce mobile wallet tomillions people, many never bank account. in unite states, largestmortgage provider online lender. in china, technology firm start world’s largestmoney market fund.yet, alongside growth fintech, predecessor fsb chair emphasized, asregulators must ensure maximize potential benefit development fintechwe minimize potential risk costs. the fsb monitor analyze financial stabilityimplications financial innovation part mandate identify address vulnerability inthe global financial system. let outline two area start examine greaterdetail: potential effect entry large technology firm financial service thepotential effect growth decentralize financial technologies.over last decade, world witness explosion large technology firm areweaving daily lives: example, facebook, amazon, apple, tencent, andbaidu. some firm increasingly provide financial services, aspayments, credit, insurance, asset management. their involvement support financialservices broadly. for example, technology may increase speed efficiency, theubiquity presence life may allow offer financial service moreconvenient way low cost consumers. further, dip toe intothe edge financial service water, effect provision financialservices could grow enormously dive in.looking technology underlie recent innovative financial products, seea move toward decentralization—that is, movement toward technology connect financialmarket participant directly without intermediary. the potential area impact broad:settling interbank payments; verify reconcile trade finance invoices; executing, enforcingand verify performance contracts; keep audit trail deter money laundering.both potential entry large, establish technology company financial service andthe ability technology decentralize financial transaction raise number issues, ofwhich may touch financial stability. technological innovation offer promise asubstantially efficient financial system. but new systems, processes, type ofbusinesses bring novel fragilities. we continue responsible ensure thatthe financial system sufficiently resilient business household worldwide need notfear collapse system serf needs.these open question need addressed, touch issue offinancial stability, fsb put significant resource understand potentiallyimportant developments. to clear, try oppose innovation, innovation,including fintech, offer world many potential benefits. a group charge ensuringfinancial stability, however, work ensure reap benefit offer bythese new technology without harm financial stability. we hope offer answer tothese question come year line principle i outline earlier. wewill address question discipline analytical rigor way incorporate viewsof public key stakeholder result answer practical intelligible.nonbank financial intermediationthe second issue i would like discus nonbank financing. since global financial crisis,nonbank finance grow relatively rapidly, absolute size relativeimportance intermediate credit. in jurisdiction fsb closely monitors, nonbank 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech financial asset 50 percent total global financial assets, share grownby close 5 percentage point since 2009. nonbank financial intermediation (the artist formerlyknown “shadow banking”) provide valuable alternative bank finance help tosupport real economic activity. accordingly, shift within financial system toward nonbankfinancing represent welcome increase diversity source lend firmsand households.even though core financial system much resilient globalfinancial crisis, strengthen bank capital liquidity requirements, nonbank finance hasbeen source systemic risk. nonbank finance often feature high leverage, maturity andliquidity mismatches, opaque structures, concentrate hold risky assets. nonbankfinancing also lead low lend standards, bid price risky asset andsending encourage signal credit underwriters. all channel play role therecent global financial crisis. more recently, new form interconnectedness nonbankfinancial firm bank system emerge could, scenarios, act aschannels domestic cross-border amplification risks.given potential risks, large—and increasing—role nonbank financing, needto monitor closely development. be growth nonbank finance alter exist marketstructures? be new vulnerability financial system? how nonbank financingdevelop?to answer important questions, fsb progress three relate tracks. first, thefsb produce annual report outline development nonbank financing, detail theglobal trend potential risks. second, fsb promote resilience nonbanks throughthe development range policy address systemic vulnerability arise, whilenot impede growth sustainable nonbank finance models. in way, hope topromote resilient nonbank financial intermediation. the fsb, work alongside standard-setting body basel committee iosco, monitor implementation ofthese policies. finally, know arrogant expect get everything right first timearound, imperative start analyze effectiveness policy beenimplemented. how alter policies? have model risk nonbankfinancing accurately? have miss crucial new source systemic risk? these allquestions must ask ourselves.evaluation too-big-to-fail reformsthe third issue i would like raise problem “too big fail"—that is, perceptionby investor institution receive support government becomedistressed. this weaken market discipline allow firm become even larger, moreleveraged complex. to address challenge, fsb global standardsetters develop framework set policy measure intend reduce moralhazard risk pose systemically important financial institutions. these measure intendedto make financial system resilient, example high capital liquidityrequirements, simultaneously allow institution fail without cause disruption tocritical services, payments. a key element fsb’s policy measure address toobig fail total loss absorb capacity standard. under standard, fsb introduce abail-in (in contrast bailout) strategy necessarily employ go concern post-failureloss-absorbing recapitalization capacity set global systemically important banks.crucially, raise resolution standards, improve potential non-disruptive bankfailure. the implementation standard advance bank sector,especially large globally important banks. the fsb establish crisis managementgroups, collection supervisor monitor resolution plan firms. at time,we must conscious actually test failure large bank 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech marketplace—surely good thing!standing decade start financial crisis, must ask ourselves, howeffective reduce problem big fail? have achieve objectiveto reduce eliminate problem? have introduce new unintended risk financialsystem cost financial market participants?to start answer important questions, part broad effort evaluate effectsof reforms, fsb launch evaluation effect too-big-to-fail reforms. weintend bring analytical rigor questions, recognize academiccommunity undertake much work area. a result, draw extensively onacademic advisor phase work undertaking. i also encourage otherexperts field look closely consultative document come studynext year. we welcome input undertake study signature issue thecrisis.conclusionlet conclude reiterate broad theme i intend convey today. first, itouched key principle i hope guide fsb work i chair. thoseprinciples include expand engagement broad range stakeholder experts,rigorous careful examination financial vulnerability may threaten financialsystem, analytical examination past reform ensure make financialsystem resilient efficient manner possible.second, i share key question work relate rise largetechnology firm financial sector decentralize financial technologies, growingimportance nonbank financial sector, burgeon effort look well wehave address big fail, signature issue recent financial crisis.moving forward surely additional issue address area examine.a duringmy time chair fsb, i hope make progress area i outline ona range forward-looking issue continue demonstrate value fsb. internationalstandard-setting body serve important role within global financial sector, i lookforward fsb advance progress work areas.the document available www.fsb.org/2019/02/fsb-work-programme-for-2019/11 6 / 6bis central bankers' speech richard h clarida: global

u.s. foreign equity bond market hastrended broadly upward several decades.channels transmission global shock u.s. economythis increase integration i describe heighten exposure u.s. economy toexternal shocks. but channel transmission shock unitedstates?for concreteness, let u consider case negative demand shock originate abroad, suchas foreign recession. first, shock affect unite state direct trade links,lowering demand u.s. export and, thus, low u.s. gdp.second, foreign recession lead low interest rate abroad and, thing equal,raises value dollar, turn low u.s. export boost u.s. imports. thedollar appreciation also put downward pressure u.s. import price and, thereby, inflation.the extent foreign worry lead safe-haven flow may add dollar’s strength.finally, contagion u.s financial

thespillover risk aversion u.s. market might well also push equity price widen1234 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech corporate credit spreads, add contractionary pressures. however, safe-havenflows

borrower lenders. the ability make payment securely irrevocably fundamental sustain confidence financial system. digitalisation proliferation mobile internet service change way pay things. new application technology promise ever faster, easy cheap pay-ment option via smartphone, tablet smartwatch. the entire payment ecosystem set undergo profound change result. my colleague thomas moser i take detail look innovation shap-ing development payment arena. we focus particular challenge innovation present central banks. in past, payment innovation often drive private sector. facilitate – especially secure – operation payment system long fundamental task many central banks, however. it thus essential various stakeholder maintain constructive dialogue. in spirit, finish presentation, hear view panel expert represent fintech, banking, infrastructure provision snb. to run efficiently, economy need function payment system payment system play important part enable economy function smoothly. allow illustrate point brief anecdote take book entitle ‘across africa’ british explorer verney lovett cameron. cameron cross equatorial africa 1875, first european so. at one stage travels, need boats. he manage page 3/9 find boat owner, owner demand pay ivory, cameron have. however, word reach person vicinity sell ivory. there one hitch: person would accept cotton cloth payment, cameron either. eventually, cameron come across somebody own cotton cloth happy part exchange wire. mercifully, cameron bring wire him. so give man require quantity wire, take cotton cloth, use pay ivory, – finally – buy boat exchange say ivory.1 this story bring home high transaction cost exchange be. if cameron need boat urgently, transaction would presumably never come pass. what miss generally accept mean exchange, i.e. money. cost efficiency driver innovation let u conduct brief think experiment. imagine moment boat owner accept gold payment, cameron him. the payment process would good deal easy faster, would benefit party transaction. have say that, transaction would still entirely free cost risks. after all, would able guarantee via-à-vis boat owner gold genuine desire purity? in addition, gold heavy involve transport costs, risk loss due accident theft (especially travelling) considerable. the desire cost efficiency security always major driver innovation realm payments. way back 7th century bce, lydian king begin issue small, standardise gold coin stamp royal emblems. by emboss coin way, king could guarantee weight purity gold coin issued.2 in first slide – highly simplify depiction history money – initial phase: transition privately own gold gold coin guarantee state. this milestone evolution trade prosperity. late on, merchant invent payment instruments, include promissory note cheques; and, 17th century, first privately issue banknote emerge europe.3 these innovation significantly reduce transport cost involve make payment simultaneously improve security. on slide, second phase: transition coin intrinsic value promissory notes, cheque privately issue banknotes. 1 a reproduce rudolf richter (1990), geldtheorie – vorlesung auf d grundlage d allgemeinen gleichgewichtstheorie und d institutionenökonomik, berlin, pp. 120 et seq. 2 specifically: electrum, naturally occur alloy gold silver. 3 the existence paper money china date back 10th century. in europe, first banknote issue 1661 stockholm. in switzerland, first banknote put circulation berne 1826. page 4/9 central bank play fundamental role payment system now, important remember neither promissory note cheque – even banknote – era actual money, merely claim money. such instrument could use settle payment obligation finality. there always risk borrower would enough precious metal honour payment obligation due date. the use payment promise trade thus entail substantial credit liquidity risk. these risk could undermine confidence payment instruments, bring trade standstill. and this, lady gentlemen, central bank enter equation. central bank reduce payment-related risk effectively. by establish security confidence, contribute decisively efficiency payment system. today, money change hand mainly via transfer direct debits, payment book directly commercial banks’ account central bank. settle electronic central bank money equivalent settle cash; final irrevocable. this approach reduce credit risk inspire confidence – payment system money itself. on slide, third phase: transition private promise pay central bank money – words, today’s banknote electronic sight deposit commercial bank hold central bank. rtgs system – milestone evolution cashless payment let u turn switzerland. for many years, postal cheque service swiss post heart cashless payment system. this area begin become attractive bank well middle 20th century. around time, so-called ‘bank clearing’ – switzerland’s first interbank payment system – come existence. this important step development cashless payment system. however, predominantly manual nature system make cumbersome. it could take four day execute payment, make efficient liquidity management virtually impossible participate banks. furthermore, ‘bank clearing’ system, payment settle net basis. in words, incoming outgo payment offset other, net difference transfer bank end settlement period. in order facilitate banks’ liquidity management, snb allow temporarily overdraw account end settlement period. this delay settlement create credit risk snb. these shortcoming prompt bank seek new solutions. in 1987, new payment system know ‘swiss interbank clearing’ (or sic, short), enter service. in sic, payment swiss franc settle bank real time gross basis. this type arrangement refer rtgs. each payment settle individually via sight deposit account central bank, provide sufficient fund available accounts. page 5/9 the advent rtgs system major milestone quest efficient secure cashless payments. it surprise, then, rtgs system become standard payment settlement mechanism recent decades, 100 central bank worldwide operate them.4 the sic system exhibit specifically swiss characteristics, least close partnership exist bank snb. sic own swiss bank operate six interbank clear ltd behalf, subject oversight, snb. another unique feature switzerland’s sic system that, unlike rtgs systems, use exclusively process interbank payments,5 also settle retail payment – exchange payment behalf households, corporation public body – individually gross basis. experience sic system show combination interbank payment retail payment beneficial. first, economy scale bring transaction cost significantly. second, fact retail payment also settle central bank money increase security. moreover, sic participant optimise liquidity management reduce technical interfaces, since use single system swiss franc payments. the transition net settlement electronic money rtgs system last phase evolution payment system show slide. sic prove adaptable, secure cost-effective system. since 1980s, payment requirement demand place payment system rise relentlessly. for one thing, volume transaction increase hugely, especially retail sector.6 equally, new payment instruments, e-banking, emerge years.7 more recently, iso 20022 standard introduce basis national international harmonisation retail payments, sic’s operate hour extend allow same-day settlement retail payments. new challenge digital age lady gentlemen, digitalisation bring whole new set change payment systems. what implication change entire payment ecosystem? and adjustment cashless payment system undergo remain efficient secure future? 4 allsopp, peter et al. (2009), the evolution real-time gross settlement – access, liquidity credit, pricing, the world bank financial infrastructure series – payment system policy research, february 2009. 5 interbank payment comprise payment relate fx operation money capital market transactions, also large-value payment transact non-bank sector. 6 postfinance’s decision 2016 settle domestic payment via sic future also significantly increase volume retail payment sic system. 7 the recent snb survey payment method show cash continue play important role payment switzerland. however, large proportion payment household conduct via credit card, via debit card. swiss national bank (2018), survey payment method 2017 – survey payment behaviour use cash switzerland. page 6/9 before turn important questions, i emphasise i talk cryptocurrencies bitcoin ether.8 the question i focus today is: digitalisation change payment systems? one important find change work digitalisation affect entire payment ecosystem. just cog wheel watch mesh together, change unfold specific sector occur isolation; interrelated, slide shows. what drive fundamental changes? the initial impulse transformation often come new technical possibility smartphones tablets, big data application artificial intelligence. these technology open new payment service end client (e.g. twint) new business model companies. the mantra invariably faster, easier, cheaper. at time, technology low barrier entry new player market payment services, fintech companies. and finally, payment infrastructure regulatory framework play important role, term secure payment system ensure fair competition – turn permit innovation future. these change present major challenge stakeholder payment ecosystem (cf. slide 3). i would like discus four great detail. first, central role client interface; second, disaggregation (or ‘unbundling’) value chains; third, digital ledger technology (dlt); fourth, cyber risks. the first challenge concern client contact client data. for establish provider cashless payment services, banks, payment interface long important client touchpoint. in digital age, non-banks, large internet platform online retailers, leverage payment data target client personalise products. a digitalisation progresses, quantity value client data increasing. establish provider payment service confront fact competition client interface competition client data intensifying. in digital age, wide network branch traditionally give banks’ competitive edge long provide advantage. development china show quickly bank lose client interface non-banks payment arena: within short years, online marketplace alibaba news app wechat manage capture 90% rapidly expand mobile payment segment.9 the grow focus client interface client data also represent challenge central banks. gross misuse data lack reliability could seriously erode trust payment system – ultimately money itself. even new technology 8 i cover topic money market event year ago. i stand point i make – namely, cryptocurrencies like speculative investment instrument stable payment methods. 9 financial stability board (2019), fintech market structure financial services: market development potential financial stability implications, fsb white paper, 14 february. page 7/9 possibility come stream, payment transaction must continue function secure. for payment system remain future-proof, in-depth discussion main stakeholder swiss financial centre therefore essential. the second challenge throw digitalisation unbundling value chain. in past, value chain – payment initiation, authorisation clear complaint process – largely concentrate hand single entity. thank technical innovations, however, payment service provider unbundling reconfiguring value chain. for instance, take product specialise provider – e.g. relate fx transactions, payment guarantee ‘mobile wallets’ – combine them. establish provider payment service adapt unbundling. they cooperate new players, invest value chain simultaneously satisfy demand ever fast easy payment methods. the central banks, too, face challenge: need develop core payment infrastructure way unbundling value chain successfully navigate – without new risk created. a result, see many central bank adapt rtgs systems. for example, retail payment increasingly settle via rtgs system (something long time unique switzerland), long operate time introduce settlement time shortened. these major international trends, switzerland think wish position ourselves. there also question integrate new player – fintechs – payment infrastructure. in next slide, payment ecosystem two-tier financial system present simplify form. on first level, via rtgs (blue field), central bank enable financial institution settle payment use secure system electronic central bank money. on second level (green field), financial institution enable retail payments. when come integrate new players, currently two models: first, indirect access via banks. this ‘open access’ approach, show left-hand side slide ‘model 1’ (client –> fintech –> bank), one adopt eu. the new payment service directive (psd2) require eu bank grant fintechs access bank accounts. the second option involve grant fintechs direct access core payment systems. this ‘direct access’ approach show right-hand side slide ‘model 2’ (fintech –> rtgs). switzerland choose approach. a snb announce begin year, grant fintech company access sic system snb sight deposit accounts, provide fintech licence business model make significant participant area payment transactions. the advantage direct access model also allow retail payment make use page 8/9 payment solution new provider settle efficiently securely central bank money. this change create level play field within sic system exist new provider – ensure swiss franc payment system remain efficient, secure future-proof. the third challenge concern possible application dlt payment transactions. switzerland, particular, witness establishment fintech ecosystem recent years, lead fintech hub. for central banks, dlt raise least two fundamental questions. first, could end replace current core infrastructure, rtgs? various central bank experiment idea, close collaboration private stakeholders. the result yet demonstrate dlt superior modern rtgs. yet, area core infrastructure, security settlement, entirely plausible dlt-based system could take hold. the second question is: how exist system base conventional technology new dlt-based system interoperate? should central bank private sector player establish link? specifically, context: central bank offer digital token certain dlt application – security settlement? here, too, number experiment underway, currently example token become established. furthermore, private sector provider put money dlt system ‘tokenising’ (e.g. form ‘stable coins’).10 a see, lady gentlemen, lot question still answered, require careful analysis. innovation important, must come expense stability confidence exist payment systems. the fourth challenge relate downside digitalisation: cyber risks. cashless payment particularly attractive target cyber attacks. a lot stake central bank regard too, loss confidence payment system could ultimately undermine confidence money. tackle risk may open new business opportunities. achieve significantly great resilience cyber risk could give switzerland important competitive edge future. in particular, might worth invest new, robust secure data communication infrastructure. promise solution currently develop right doorstep. for example, team eth zurich create scion, new internet architecture enhance security reliability internet communication considerably. this technology could form basis secure swiss finance network. for 10 while token would back official currency like swiss franc, represent claim give private sector provider, central bank. page 9/9 swiss payment ecosystem particular, would allow secure flexible communication participants. to meet four challenge prepare digital future, swiss financial centre need engage open dialogue strategic options. it important reach consensus robust, attractive future-proof payment system switzerland look like. which digital challenge interest party manage own? and might share solution beneficial concerned? ultimately, common goal: maintain confidence currency. against backdrop, efficient secure payment system critical ever year ahead. conclusion lady gentlemen, snb mandate facilitate secure operation cashless payment systems. it fulfil task act commission party sic system, guide latter’s ongoing development conjunction banks. in doing, create condition infrastructure level efficient, secure future-proof swiss franc payments. the snb act interest stakeholder cashless payment system swiss francs. to end, engage active dialogue bank non-banks. this evening, give perspective central bank, however important hear perspectives, too. so i particularly look forward panel discussion. the note economist author jürg müller act moderator. after discussion, panellists, thomas moser i happy take question audience. i hope continue conversation drink reception. andréa m. maechler, member govern board thomas moser, alternate member govern

view base assessment resilience thelabour market therefore wage growth. wage dynamic far broadly withstand thegrowth slowdown.growth compensation per employee fell slightly last quarter 2018 2.5%

2019.* * *as prepare deliveryintroductiongood morning. thank much kind introduction. i happy participate conference “bank regulation, lending, growth,”sponsored columbia university bank policy institute. the agenda cover number ofimportant bank issue i talk idea policy efficiency supervisoryperspective.before beginning, let emphasize view i express necessarilyreflect federal reserve bank new york federal reserve system.public policy strive efficient, efficiency simple concept, particularly thecontext supervision large financial firm world complex, official sectorhas multiple objectives, impact lag long uncertain. for example, supervisor careabout safety soundness individual financial firms, provision financialservices support real economy, consumer welfare financial inclusion, aboutfinancial stability. more generally, supervision regulation design supportproductive financial intermediation limit disruption financial stability risks.today, i talk simple framework one view policy efficiency world twopolicy objective – financial intermediation financial stability. a traditional finance theory,one think “efficient policy frontier” map trade-off among objectives. one might choose set policy support high level financial intermediation alsoaccepts high risk disruption crisis. this might achieved, example, relativelylight oversight low capital requirements. alternatively, one might choose different set ofpolicies, intensive oversight stringent capital requirement likely reducesrisk, also limit intermediation.an efficient policy one minimize risk desire level intermediation—it theefficient policy frontier. this efficiency idea distinct policy choice itself, ofthese policy regime efficient sense risk low possible desiredlevel intermediation. i’ll emphasize framework agnostic merit one policychoice another. that is, positive framework normative one, i won’t look atthis normative perspective. policy preference vary set bypolicymakers.i believe simple framework useful assess discuss change supervisoryor regulatory policy design different purpose mind. for example, policychange could design increase efficiency move toward frontier. this could entailchanging rules, regulations, supervisory practice order promote financialintermediation without increase risk. obvious example could eliminate complexcompliance regime activity bank long perform reduce redundancy datareporting. it seem like good idea always pursue type efficiency gains.123 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech alternatively, policy change could design achieve different risk return profile. thiscould shift mix policy design achieve low-intermediation low-riskoutcome mix policy design support high intermediation accept greaterrisk. either regime efficient consistent policymakers’ preferences, butthe expect outcome would quite different.from public policy perspective, view, important clear distinguish betweenthese two type policy change. for example, one might expect great number bankfailures stress le effective supervisory oversight high borrow costsin world high capital requirements. those may desire outcomes, wouldbe predictable ones. from risk management perspective, might view acceptedrisk particular policy choice. by contrast, policy change design increase efficiencymight come undesirable outcomes.in practice, however, difficult differentiate among driver policy change due tomeasurement assessment challenges, potentially long impact horizon, differentviews social private perspective. i’ll turn describe efficiency frameworkand discus practical issues.policy efficiencyas point departure, i’ll begin idea i expect familiar you. standardfinance theory suggest investor face trade-off risk return outline theset feasible option across portfolios. an investor choose portfolio high expectedreturns high risk, portfolio low expect return low risk.i think useful analogy supervisory regulatory policy. on one hand, officialsector care provision financial service credit, deposit-taking, payments,and risk transfer, effective intermediation support economic growth consumer well-being. this basic function financial sector think return onbanking. on hand, official sector also care reduce disruption theprovision service broad financial stability risks. it decade since thefinancial crisis 2008–2009 impose enormous social cost u.s. economy,so risk remain salient many us.in context, risk disruption financial crisis matter potentialreduction necessary financial service economic activity future. a i discuss atalk conference year ago, short-term discussion balance firmresilience provision financial service may reframed long horizon adynamic trade-off provision financial service today future. thisrisk/return framework extend perspective one care volatility financialservices across different state world time.the idea multiple objective suggest policy trade-off efficient frontier. in thisframework, efficient financial sector regime realize intermediation accept ahigher risk financial instability le intermediation future. a second premise thatthe official sector impact outcome relative frontier combination rules,regulation, supervisory policies. for example, reduction loan documentationrequirements, risk management review supervisory oversight might allow increase lendingin short-run, potentially low loan quality increase risk time. a particular set calibration policy efficient way increase financialintermediation accept high risk disruption crisis. equivalently, efficient outcome isone way reduce risk accept le intermediation. this say allcomponents supervisory regulatory policy come trade-off, point,456 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech policy intervention become le effective, intermediation

financial intermediation, also relatively low financial stability risk. in thisenvironment, supervisor might impose tight lend standards, project positive netpresent value low risk potentially leave unfunded. you might see high capital charge onrelatively low-risk activities, restriction prohibition certain risky activities, relativelyfrequent exams. intermediation credit growth might slow

disruption financialcrisis. in environment, bank might incline assume “risk-on” posture withlooser underwrite standards, risky project funded. oversight would low bankswould feel le constrained. on average, great intermediation would likely support moreeconomic activity short-run high probability disruption late on.finally, point c represent outcome policy regime efficient. a different mixof policy could increase intermediation decrease risk (or both) associate trade-offs. point c never good outcome. example policy might burdensomecompliance regime activity bank doesn’t engage in, redundant data request theofficial sector, risk management system address material risks.to summarize, point a point b think efficient outcomes, onlyway support financial intermediation accept high

change policy mix push outcome toward efficient frontier arelikely welfare-enhancing. the official sector always look opportunity tomove financial sector toward frontier.as practical application framework, consider federal reserve’s commitment totailoring ensure supervision scale appropriately risk associate withdifferent type institutions. recent example could include stress test

ability tailor regime reflect risk associate differenttypes institutions, would likely leave one-size-fits-all approach optimal forany type firm financial system whole.discussion issuesthe simple

thatrely big datasets sophisticate predictive algorithm might change risk/returnopportunities associate certain intermediation services. similarly, supervisory innovationslike stress test sophisticate horizontal assessment could make official sectoroversight effective. finally, change business strategy like shift diversifiedbusiness model might change overall risk certain activities. one think

choicesmore effective. this area i believe official sector, industry participants, andresearchers continue make progress.social private perspectivea second interest issue reflect perspective risk return. in traditional portfolioinvestment problems, clearly risk return private investor. when think aboutpolicy, however, appropriate perspective official sector society whole, whichlikely differ perspective individual firm. that is, official sector privatesector might measure ax differently—particularly risk axis—because official sectorcares spillovers, externalities, market failure private actor may ignore. this broad perspective critical part supervisory framework large bank wasimplemented financial crisis. in particular, official sector recognize potentialimpact stress large bank

socialand private perspectives.distinguishing policy changes101112 4 / 7bis central bankers' speech a third issue always easy distinguish policy change move outcome alongthe frontier policy change

proposal around stressedcapital buffer, example, simplify capital regime also relax assumptions. finally, policy change might interact blend together.how know policy intent? the obvious answer look state rationaleand motivation associate policy change. for example, analysis baselcommittee long-term economic impact strong capital liquidity requirementsaccepted potential cost high loan spread reduce output levels, beviewed movement leave along frontier. it also useful think carefully expect impacts—both desire undesired—andmake ex ante predictions. what likely behavioral response? how might balance sheetand income statement change? what might financial market reflect?at risk take simple framework far, let’s think might happen marketindicators two scenarios—a movement toward

complex dynamic financial institution develop betterpolicy.resource efficiencyfinally, i’ll emphasize i focus one specific type policy efficiency look theability achieve multiple objectives. alternatively, one could think efficiency directlyin term resource burden, private sector official sector. forexample, federal reserve aim minimize compliance burden achieve policygoals. that

requirements, interest rate nplsa core element strategic plan ensure financial system resilient, itcan withstand future shock protect wide economy financial instability. the first setof issue invite address – capital requirements, interest rate npls – becaptured objective.in term capital, domestic bank system far resilient past.its capital position (relative risk-weighted assets) improve almost threefold relative to2007.reliance short-term wholesale fund international capital market hasdeclined. the domestic bank system primarily fund domestic customerdeposits. 2 / 5bis central bankers'

build additional resilience institution whose failure would systemic impact onthe economy financial system.in consider prevail mortgage rates, number factor need take account.these include:historical default rate level npls irish residential mortgage portfolios;mortgages ireland continue issue relatively high loan-to-value ratios, whencompared level within jurisdictions;the small scale irish market mean cost base higher, view theincreasing importance fix cost bank (including cost it systems);lower level mortgage switch ireland observe many europeanmarkets; andthe limit number bank reduce

resilience-enhancing measure take atimely manner, strengthen balance sheet good time allow economyand financial system good withstand adverse economic financial conditions.building resilience also critical credit union sector. the central bank recognise theimportant role play credit union ireland. our vision “strong credit union safehands” underpin statutory mandate ensure credit union protect

don’t rush quickly conclusion it’sfair say conversation started.if conversation started, mean interest rate stay low evenlonger?praet: i think it’s difficult say today. when look prices, market prices, yes date thefirst lift-off push market participants, debate tiering beencoming. a i say, perspective rate long something look at, theconsequences that.does tiering make tool negative interest

that. we bigeffects negative rate economy, good also bank themselvesbecause customer good it’s also good them. the question come today isthat slow economy, international geopolitical factors, getlower

pipeline. if eurozone head recession, thesituation deteriorate significantly, what’s actually leave ecb do?praet: we don’t like speak much toolbox. there many question thetoolbox say, oh, mysterious toolbox that? once start talkingabout something, get lot speculative attitude speculation andhow far go go. you say path always control need dosomething mandate, find way that. i think realistically situation whichis probabilistic term economy recover come quarters,because that’s scenario, basically would see increase credit spreads.you would see impairment lend conditions, standard would tighten. then 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech appropriate instrument example tltro central bank influencelending conditions. that’s tiering discussion come back see point theconditions evolve way see impairment lend part thecorporate bond markets. then central bank may wish use instruments.that’s context. speculate big crisis, i think that’s something i don’t want do.is qe still possible

it’s time speculate this.you look back eight year ecb i wondering, yourworst possible day job?praet: i don’t bad day ecb, really. i think things, i’mreaching end. i difficult days, yes, sometimes

sometimes extremely stressful.when team change totally situation least me. i cannot speak theworst day.if really push me, thing bad day, i would immediately say wasless unity. you see, situation

international spillover monetarypolicy relate financial stability concern euro area. i focus ourfinancial stability assessment present juncture. in so, i briefly refer ananalytical tool employ monitor ass bank system’s resilience.globalisation cause inflation output become increasingly synchronisedacross countries. equity price finance condition become synchronised, too.most synchronisation stem (common) global shocks, effect internationalspillovers monetary policy le obvious.in talk today, i touch upon issue surround international spillovers, whetherthey concern financial stability euro area.in globalise financially integrate world, spillover monetary policy one countryto economy unavoidable.we identify least three international transmission channels:1. the “aggregate demand” channel, monetary policy affect domestic demandand, thus, demand foreign goods.2. the “exchange rate competitiveness” channel, monetary policy affect theexchange rate, mean change price domestic good relative foreign goods.3. the “financial channel”, monetary policy affect domestic financial conditions.when strong financial connection countries, condition maychange abroad well.from transmission channels, let focus “financial channel” remainder ofmy talk.financial spillover u monetary policy euro areameasuring international spillover easy, global shock lead economy movingin synchronise manner reason unrelated monetary policy.in line previous evidence, recent ecb research identify large financial spillover usmonetary policy global financial conditions, include euro area financial conditions.more specifically, course one month, monetary policy tighten federalreserve system drive euro area corporate bond spread much u corporatebond spreads. it also trigger decline euro area stock market similar magnitude thedeclines u stock markets.however, financial spillover ecb monetary policy u bond spreads, foreignequity markets, find le impactful. this asymmetry international

policyof federal reserve euro area inflation output. this suggest ecb monetary policyactions are, large, able shield euro area economy spillover usmonetary policy.but undoubtedly, evidence u monetary policy driver “global financialcycle”.in step financial cycle risk euro area financial stability change well.current financial stability concern euro areaas know, characterisation main risk euro area financial stability remainedbroadly unchanged recent years. we see four main risks: the prominent riskstems possibility disorderly increase global risk premia. the second risk isrelated renew debt sustainability concerns, sovereign debt particular. the third risk isthat banks’ intermediation capacity may hamper continue low profitability. finally,we opinion possible liquidity strain investment fund sector constitute agrowing risk. all four risk intertwine would have, materialise, thepotential mutually reinforcing.in 2018, grow economy improve bank sector resilience important positivefactors support financial stability. now, however, assessment affect weakeningeconomic growth outlook euro area. in late ecb staff macroeconomic projections,expected real gdp growth revise downwards, outlook continue view astilted downside account persistent uncertainty relate geopolitical factors, thethreat protectionism vulnerability emerge markets.in view, deterioration growth outlook increase risk financial instabilityparticularly via two main channels. first, low economic growth raise concern sovereigndebt sustainability. and second, dampen profitability prospect bank sector.a weak growth trajectory challenge euro area sovereigns’ ongoing deleveraging. lowgrowth elevate public sector debt also leave number euro area country vulnerable tohigher fund costs. furthermore, threat stem rise protectionism around globe,and high political uncertainty within europe, may amplify potential correction sovereign bondrisk premia. these risk notwithstanding, market-based indicator stress euro areasovereign bond market remain relatively contain 2019, debt sustainabilityconcerns remain country-specific. look ahead, growth prospect moderate isimperative fiscal buff rebuild country government debt still high.a prolong period low economic growth also pose challenge euro area banks. over thepast ten year follow great financial crisis, fund strain subsequently hamperedbank intermediation capacity relate low bank profitability figure prominently riskassessments. the low growth inflation environment probably exert downward pressureon risk-free rate component bond across maturities. a result, profitability stemmingfrom maturity transformation business may come renew pressure – least asretail household deposit tend bind zero. furthermore, downside risk theeconomic outlook materialise, high loan loss provision may compress bankprofitability.accommodative monetary policy greatly support bank profitability past years. in fact,conventional unconventional measure improve quality credit overall, thereby67 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech reduce provision needs. our measure also increase demand loans, whichhas offset negative effect compress margins. furthermore, structural factorsare also weigh heavily euro area banks’ profitability.in environment cyclical factor may exert downward pressure bankprofitability, bank would need step effort overcome structural challenges. suchmeasures may include cost reduction – include low staff cost streamline ofbranch networks, enhance digitalisation – imply initial, one-off large-scale investments,revenue diversification reduction stock non-performing loan six countrieswhere level still high.a number regulatory policy measure could help improve institutional set inwhich bank sector operate facilitate banks’ effort adjust business models.such measure include complete bank union (in particular establishment aeuropean deposit insurance scheme), subsequent removal remain non-harmonisednational option discretions, make progress capital market union. this couldfoster consolidation, include across borders, address problem overcapacityin euro area bank system.assessing financial stability euro areabeyond regular monitor activities, financial stability analysis entail assess impact onthe financial system risk materialising, include risk relate international spillovers. suchassessments also help inform calibration possible appropriate macroprudential policyresponses.the stress-testing framework important analytical tool quantitatively ass financialsystem vulnerability risks. stress test exercise bank sector ass thesector’s resilience perform adverse circumstances, thus provide measureof severity risks. individual bank result provide information banks’potential capital needs. stress test therefore show financial system react whenrisks, relate spillovers, materialise.in order enhance stress-testing capacity, ecb invest analytical frameworkthat track resilience bank sector also account interact withand fee back economy whole.this framework complement eu-wide stress test conduct aegis theeuropean bank authority (eba), predominantly microprudential nature.our so-called macroprudential stress test loosen assumption banks’ balance sheetsare constant. a bank hit by, say, negative (spillover) effect global environment,they may react deleveraging loan books. this type stress test also account forwhat implication banks’ reaction would real economy. in words,macroprudential stress test consider adverse credit supply shock may lead anamplification macroeconomic effect global shock, which, turn, could furtherdamage banks’ balance sheets. by model negative feedback loop bankingsector real economy beyond first round shocks, believe exercise becomesmore realistic.a macroprudential stress test bank directly supervise ecb, use baseline andadverse scenario recent eba stress test, confirm general resilience euroarea bank system. results, however, point additional fall gdp 1.6% across theeuro area, top gdp shock adverse scenario three-year horizon.this stress-testing framework also inform calibration macroprudential policy the8 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech aim limit unintended spillover part financial system real economy.in spirit pre-emptive macroprudential policy, exercise emphasise need forthe timely build-up capital buffers, use absorb loss risksmaterialise, affect growth employment.finally, stress-testing framework use analyse spillover effect themacroprudential policy themselves.for instance, another find framework capital-constrained bank likely toreduce foreign exposure domestic ones. we particularly concern aboutspillover effect macroprudential policy within euro area, build-up acapital buff one country should, extent possible,

theunited states.but convince appropriate policy tool largely shield euro areaeconomy financial system spillovers. monetary policy macroprudential policyhave different objective and, therefore, different set policy tools.cyclical factors, compress interest margins, pose challenge banks’ operatingenvironment, gain far greatly offset losses. in turn, euro area bank need toaddress structural

export good service act main driver growth domestic sector well-below historical average. last year mark turn point growth become balanced. private consumption strengthened, support improvement employment major sector well government measure support low income groups, state welfare card project. in addition, private investment expand increase investment machinery equipment along great construction activity overall growth become broad-based. we see markedly increase interest foreign investors, especially eec area. consequently, 2018 thai economy expand solid footing, growth 4.8 percent first half, moderate second half due slow global demand. this weak global demand largely result slow economic growth number major trade partners; number country-specific transitory factors; uncertainty surround trade tension u china. nevertheless, thank balance growth engines, thai economy grow 4.1 percent 2018, improvement 4.0 percent growth 2017. it also first time decade thai economy register consecutive annual growth 4 percent. look ahead, thai economy project continue expand around potential, growth year slightly moderate 3.8 percent slow growth major trade partner weigh export sector. domestic demand would remain key growth driver, 3/9 private consumption continue support government welfare measure underpin factors, employment consumer confidence, remain strong. furthermore, private investment expect continue improve, aid investment eec area, progress public-private partnership infrastructure projects, relocation production base thailand industry electronics, automotive parts, rubber. meanwhile, tourism sector expect continue expand mainly due improve confidence return chinese tourists. it expect number foreign tourist exceed 40 million year. lady gentlemen, although outlook indicate sustain growth, number risk factor remain. these include (1) the potential impact u protectionist policy trade tension china, far mix effect thai economy. the direct effect u safeguard measure certain product lead slowdown export solar cell wash machines, though small impact overall export 1. meanwhile, u trade measure china could indirect impact thai export number thai firm part chinese production supply chain networks; potential reduction chinese export reduce demand thai supply. furthermore, measure lead trade diversion, consequence remain determined. on one hand, thai economy may benefit new investment relocation chinese factories. thai firm may able supplant chinese competitor export us. on hand, trade diversion lead increase competition within thailand excess supply good china divert thai market price discount compete local products. besides, prolong uncertainty surround trade measure lead unusual front-loading export 2018 weigh export growth 2019—just global demand begin moderate. it also impair business sentiments, prevent firm take new investment projects. ultimately, us-china trade dispute remain unresolved us’s inclination trade 1 both product make le 1 percent thailand’s total export 4/9 protectionism remains, potential u auto tariff measure, trade dispute certainly key concern authorities. (2) slowdown chinese economy another concern. while slowdown may line chinese authorities’ goal restructure economy towards long-run sustain growth model, short-term significant impact thai economy. this high degree linkage term supply chain production networks, tourism, property investment. for instance, china thailand’s second large export partner follow asean region, make 12 percent export term value chinese tourist represent nearly 30 percent total foreign tourists. besides, slowdown chinese economy may contribute high volatility chinese yuan; movement influence movement baht currency region. against backdrop, short-term slowdown chinese economy need closely monitored. (3) geopolitical risk many part world remain elevated. these include long-standing issue us-north korea relations, middle east conflicts, development brexit. in addition, new source fragility continue emerge, recent dispute india pakistan venezuelan political tensions. while conflict may directly relate thai economy, presence geopolitical risk could introduce bout uncertainty impair sentiments, lead capital flow volatility thailand emerge market economies. (4) lastly, domestic political front, give unofficial result general election weekend, uncertainty remain new coalition government formed. the result play big part determine major government policy go forward. lady gentlemen, talk short-term risk factor may curb appetite many audience tonight. so, let turn long-term perspective thai economy. despite risk issue highlighted, i confident thai economy posse resilience support long-term growth cushion risk factors. recent history show thai economy resilience withstand adverse event 5/9 quick recover. over past ten year economy endure number shocks—externally, global financial crisis 2009 begin quantitative tightening; internally, domestic political turmoil throughout decade, big flood 2011, pass his late majesty king bhumibol adulyadej 2016. and yet, past decade thai economy grow annual average 3.3 percent; register positive current account surplus eight last ten years; thai baht one stable currency region. the economy able overcome challenges, posse unique set qualities, quality contribute resilience. these key quality macroeconomic stability, diversify growth engines, ability adapt new challenges. lady gentlemen, have sound macroeconomic stability important economy ensure confidence provide environment conducive growth. it also act critical buffer, especially small open economy, episode external shock capital flow volatility. the thai economy posse macroeconomic stability least four key areas: (1) our external stability remain strong, ample foreign reserves, cover 3.4 time short-term external debt. our current account surplus positive five consecutive year project around 34.5 billion usd year, around 6.4 percent gdp. in addition, economy low dependency external financing, external debt gdp ratio median level emerge market economies2. (2) the bank sector robust, high capital adequacy ratio stable domestic funding. at end 2018, capital adequacy ratio bank system stand 18.3 percent, level well minimum international requirement among high region. meanwhile, loan growth pick line economic expansion level non-performing loan stabilized. (3) the fiscal position remain strong sufficient space support economy case downturn. public debt gdp around 2 thailand’s external debt gdp 35.3 percent 2018 v median 37.8 percent em economies. imf data calculate bot 6/9 42 percent, level commonly accept threshold 60 percent. meanwhile, enactment fiscal responsibility act would ensure fiscal discipline improvement spend transparency limit conduct open-ended populist policies. (4) domestic price pressure remain moderate stable, largely result slow recovery global oil price positive structural factors, globalization technological advancement. low stable domestic price pressure continue provide favorable environment conducive economic activity. while overall macroeconomic stability sound, pocket risk remain. in response, bank thailand take number action include implementation new limit credit card personal loan address problem household debt; establishment debt clinic help restructure debt individual multiple creditors; tighten mortgage loan underwrite standard curb speculation house market. along line, back strong economic performance ample liquidity, monetary policy committee raise policy rate december last year largely preempt potential build-up financial vulnerability investor’s “search-for-yield” behavior underprice risk prolong period ultra-low interest rate. lady gentlemen, let turn resilience support diversify growth engines, turn enable thai economy agent mitigate adverse events. while i previously state begin talk driver growth become balanced, structurally—being small open economy—export performance still play important role main growth driver. but, look closely export portfolio, would find well-diversified provide cushion market-specific product-specific risks. this thailand establish export tie 80 countries; exporter become le reliance major economies. just ten year ago, export g3 economy make around 40 percent total export value asean economy stand 21 percent. in contrast, ratio today stand 31 percent 27 percent, respectively. in term product mix, economy neither depend specific commodity particular manufacture sector. this allow growth 7/9 development new industry serve domestic external demands. certainly, effort attract new investment eec area enhance ability diversify, establishment industry future. the tourism industry another well-diversified sector. with many unique destination attractions, tourism industry able cater wide range customer term price activities—from luxurious wellness center medical tourist affordable accommodation first-time foreign travelers. in fact, recent tourist pattern may indicate long low season thailand. the number incoming foreign tourist become relatively stable throughout year different mix across different seasons. more importantly, give choice attraction selection price range, thailand unique position attract many first-time foreign tourists, especially rise middle class china, india, indonesia, vietnam. last least ability economy thai people adapt change. the notion adaptability important economic resilience respond adverse event uncertainty also cope disruptive changes, especially backdrop change landscape bring technological advancement. speak behalf thai people, i believe history play big part influence action mindsets, allow u cope new challenges. specifically, thailand’s long history open trade nation—having limit resource military strength, operate landscape continue foreign threats—has implant mindset thai open-minded receptive new opportunity flexible approach adversities. it mindset allow nation adapt change environment withstand various threats. look ahead, resilience certainly test disruptive change bring technological advancement. thus far, thai people show able adapt receptive new opportunity come new technologies. this see remarkable rate adoption promptpay faster-pay service since launch two year ago, 47 million subscribe accounts, large number consider total population thailand 66 million. during period, usage digital 8/9 payment almost doubled, reaffirm receptiveness thai people new payment channel. moreover, thai population digitally engaged, rank among top country high number social medium users3. this create opportunity new platform emerge innovation prosper. besides people, increase number thai business incorporate new technology work processes. over past years, manufacturer invest heavily machinery system increase utilization automation evidence increase robot installation thai factories4. firm non-manufacturing sector also move fast adopt new technologies—from bank telco offer efficient digital financial services; shop abandon physical storefront employ e-commerce social-commerce platforms; firm advertise social medium platforms. to encourage technological adoption improve adaptive capabilities, ultimately build resilience, also important regulatory environment conducive foster innovations. and goal facilitate innovative environment bank thailand take number initiative recent years. these include  continue regulatory reform foreign exchange regulation remove outdated requirements, allow great flexibility foreign exchange management, improve ease business;  relax money transfer business ownership requirement allow great competition reduce cost cross-border money transfer;  streamline regulatory sandbox scheme allow new fin-tech product reach

well among regional partner in summary, ability adapt new environment along macroeconomic stability diversify growth engine enable thai economy resilience endure adverse incident safeguard u impact future uncertainty disruptions. lady gentlemen, i come end talk. let give brief summary i say today. the thai economy expect continue expand, though slightly slow pace, domestic demand main driver growth. the risk concern go forward include prolong trade disputes, slowdown chinese economy, geopolitical risks, transition thai political landscape. nevertheless, economy possess three important

what digitalisation differ concept automation technological advances? jesper roine, professor stockholm school eco-nomics divide useful manner.3  automation – machine work person.  digitalisation – convert information digital form.  technological advance – broad concept cover two also things. the concept course related. digitalisation enable automation example technological advances. in speech i focus digitalisation, also touch automation follow digitalisation. i wish include concept digitalisation machine learning, artificial intelligence, 3d printer use cloud service big data. a common collective name of-ten use several technology industry 4.0 fourth industrial revolution. will productivity increase? how far come regard digitalisation business sector? one hear awful lot technological development medium business journals. from write one might easily gain impression faster. but official data productivity confirm this. the fact statistic reality sometimes appear disconnect one another nothing new. in 1987 economist robert solow write “you see computer age everywhere productivity statistics”, describe emergence information communication technology (ict) relatively low productivity growth unite state 1980s. if look sweden, productivity growth business sector weak since 2006, year global financial crisis occurred. we often revise productivity forecast result surprisingly weak development. productivity also show weak development de-veloped country recently, indicate result joint trend. there many possible explanation decline. some economists, robert gordon, say period low productivity growth new normal rather long time. accord point view, large share fruit digitalisation already harvested. a early 2005, instance, several economy adapt business method model 3 roine (2016). 3 [12] internet. the conclusion point view is, put simply, re-cent innovation significant early industrial rev-olutions.4 others, andrew mcafee erik brynjolfsson mit, say effect digitalisation pass radar see major produc-tivity increase future new technology use broadly business sector.5 economic historian joel mokyr also point pro-ductive potential new technology lead strong pressure change economy.6 a hear, differ view subject assessment future productivity growth question constantly struggle with. we “installation phase” personally, i think model bart van ark (2016) useful consid-ering different views. this distinguish “installation phase” “deployment phase” new technology. the first phase involve explore new market growth limit couple companies. during second phase market consolidate broad growth economy. one imagine brynjolfsson mcafee consider first phase, gordon think already pass second phase. my assessment probably somewhere installation phase regard digitalisation. i base some, few, company see market power increase recent years.7 these company often know “su-perstars” high profit margin experience high return in-vested capital. they often multinational corporation sell product service world. at time, appear though small compa-nies fare le well. the difference productivity superstar ordinary company also increased.8 when talk company

industrial sector, reach employment peak mid-1960s. gradually, job industrial sector replace job service industries, include public sector. this process continue 1990s 2000s 2018 50 per cent private

make workplace good improve health. a somewhat hackneyed nevertheless descrip-tive quote nobel prize winner paul krugman “productivity isn’t everything, but, long run, almost everything”.12 ...but also create distinct challenge despite change productivity improvement long run lie behind al-most growth welfare, course important challenge short run. behind every statistic people families. own

potential effect digitalisation problem entail. i also take various area i think need meet make use technological advances. but also need investigate effect digitalisation swedish economy ask monetary policy do. this often question easy answer, structural transformation effect difficult identify, despite often affect economy long period time. for general description digitalisation affect inflation, one use model present monetary policy report february 2015.17 it pro-vides general view channel inflation influence change digitalisation occurs. firstly, digitalisation affect companies’ output capacity via automation, re-duces cost pressure total. secondly, consumer easily find in-formation price comparison site e-commerce platforms. this in-crease competition reduce companies’ mark-ups cost increase.18 thirdly, consumer price index (cpif) directly affect low cost in-formation communication technology. 17 see monetary policy report, february 2015. 18 apel et al (2014). 8 [12] productivity labour market let's begin companies’ production capacity consequence la-bour market. in manufacture industry digitalisation appear in-creased productivity, case service industries. the devel-opment employment appear poor profession digital-isation stronger. the labour market appear become po-larized large number either employ high salary low salary profes-sions.19 company respond business survey often confirm digitalisa-tion lead competence shift labour force. they see substantial need recruit specialist with, instance, digital competence le need recruit general staff.20 in consumer-related sector company believe great extent digitalisa-tion lead few employee within years, response manufacture company neutral. the explanation often manufacture industry already make major changeover digital technology already complement large group employees. in retail trade large group cashiers, stock worker shop assistant replace automate solutions. consumer behaviour digitalisation also affect u consumers. the use internet online shop-ping increase sweden high level compare euro-pean countries. we access information compare price various product various seller quickly. previously, want buy new pair shoe go several shop compare prices. first need idea find spe-cific model shoe, say pair converse all-stars size 39, need travel round find best price. now quite simply visit price comparison site online enter name model get price infor-mation, stock status suggest sale point online. this reduce search cost enormously.21 companies’ price at time, e-commerce change play field many trade com-panies change pricing. why customer pay something shop buy cheap online? 19 heyman et al (2016). 20 sverige riksbank (2018c). 21 the swedish competition authority commission

various online traders. they saw development price particular product highly correlate among large companies. this indicate reduction price spread. 9 [12] the study compare price shop price online company point difference two sale channel le one might believe.22 nevertheless, differences. within e-commerce price change often, cost increase pass consumer price fast margin tend somewhat

future prices, clear difference consumer-related compa-nies business business companies. in consumer-related companies, sale price expect fall somewhat, others consider new technology make possible raise price strengthen companies’ position international markets. digitalisation inflation target so shall take digitalisation consideration monetary policy forecasts? well, great extent question qualitative assessment effect reasonable. but sound simple really is. a i say be-fore, structural change affect economy long period time. even afterwards difficult know much specific factor affect la-bour market inflation, instance. we see evaluation low price mark-ups result of, instance, digitalisation, may contribute hold back inflation, particu-larly period 2014-2015. at time, important reason low inflation period appear low domestic cost pressures.26 and resource utilisation increased, inflation also rise to-wards target. it evidently possible attain quantify inflation target. when i follow debate monetary policy sweden, argument keep crop two-per cent target inflation impossible attain economy become increasingly digitalised. however, one also look event develop country similar targets. because course sweden alone affect digitalisation. there seem clear relationship country instance spread e-commerce inflation. however possible lack simple correlation data hide causal relationship. good indicator spread digitalisation may give 22 cavallo (2017). 23 cavallo (2018). 24 gorodnichenko talavera (2017). 25 swedish trade federation (2018). 26 sverige riksbank (2018b). 10

facilitate long-term plan individual companies. the inflation target need particular world change rapidly result major upheaval digitalisation. the alternative would le stable development poor opportunity good economic growth. clear game rule smoothly-functioning economy let summarise thoughts: my assessment digitalisation contribute new way producing, price demand good services. by main-taining stable rate inflation close target, monetary policy help changeover. to so, need understand development economic ac-tivity, well effect structural change economy. what know labour market change. they become polarized, make important people update skill new cir-cumstances. the game plan company changing. e-commerce exam-ple mean companies’ price change often become sensitive shocks. increase consumer power great competition slow price thereby margin companies. the change necessary increase welfare, even create problem people short term. to manage challenges, jointly strengthen opportunity education skill development, even gap arise upheaval safeguard interest general public strengthen competition new markets. in change world need clear game rule ensure economy function smoothly. reliable price stability, term purchase power, one game rule. it make easy individual company plan fu-ture, improve price set wage formation thus contribute stable economic activity. so, attain inflation target two per cent help accomplish changeover follow digitalisation. 11 [12] reference apel, mikael, frohm, eric, hokkanen, jyry, nyman, christina palmqvist, stefan (2014), why

reserve bank’s approach use tools. part 1 – the role macroprudential policy to start with, let’s take look systemic risk create boom bust financial cycle, macroprudential policy increase resilience bank household risk high. when economy well, bank face competitive pressure relax lend standards. when homeowner experience house price inflation, access credit generally increase. a result, lend le credit-worthy borrow increase extent harmful society (figure 1), without individual lender bear full cost high debt levels. it’s surprise dynamic apply reverse economy weakens: household income fall,

therefore elect politician may difficulty commit require long-term financial stability objective. internationally, macroprudential tool use far le actively jurisdiction government heavily involve decision-making.11 we think operational independence key macroprudential instruments. the phase 2 review raise option political oversight borrower-based tools, like lvr restrictions. the rationale that, tool incur direct distributional cost affect households, elect politician need maintain legitimacy. however, reserve bank’s view, controversial nature tool strengthen case operational independence, ensure tool use promptly necessary. that said, accountability transparency decision-makers play particularly important role macroprudential policy, financial stability inherently difficult quantify objective. the reserve bank transparent explain policy decision consultation financial stability reports, although transparency limit prior policy action. to fill gap, reserve bank recently publish macroprudential framework document explain strategy use tools. the government recently announce in-principle decision change governance framework prudential policy. we agree

reserve bank’s decision-making follow three step (figure 8). figure 8: operation macroprudential policy firstly, ass nature risk face financial system, systemic risk monitoring, use range quantitative indicators. we look probability correction credit cycle. a number study identify house price overvaluation household debt reliable predictor correction credit cycle.12 next, ass current resilience financial system correction. to this, monitor banks’ lend portfolios, capital positions, undertake stress test banks. finally, examine feedback effect identify risk wide economy. the main indicator assessment bank lend standards, could undermine resilience financial system time, increase vulnerability house market wide economy. after consider information, judge whether risk fall purview macroprudential policy. that said, set indicator mechanically capture nature risks, reason judgement always form part decision-making. the second step policy choice, consider appropriate policy response might look like. macroprudential instrument categorise capital liquidity tool focus improve bank balance sheets, borrower-based tool improve household resilience. three capital liquidity instrument available, include countercyclical capital buffer, sectoral capital requirement core fund ratio. these tool build additional buff bank system absorb adverse shocks. in downturn, buff reduce risk bank failure deleveraging, cut support supply credit economy. the single borrower-based instrument lvr restrictions. in view, debt-to-income (dti) tool would useful addition macroprudential

(2018). 1. systemic risk monitoring•probability correction•resilience•feedback effect2. policy choice•capital liquidity tools?•borrower tools?3. policy assessment•consultation•decision•ongoing assessment 12 our choice tool depend risk face. on one hand, concern low resilience bank balance sheets, capital-based instrument may effective tool. on hand, lvr restriction effective restrain exuberance house market household debt, insulate economy adverse shocks. it's worth note tool come possible cost financial system efficiency. for example, capital liquidity tool increase cost credit provision banks, borrower-based tool curtail credit availability. both effect could reduce short-run economic growth. we need choose right tool job confidence benefit financial stability exceed cost efficiency. the final step decision-making policy assessment, include consultation, final decision ongoing assessment. the consultation typically consider several policy response settle favour option. however, listen carefully stakeholder and, find argument persuasive, change views. once macroprudential tool deployed, reserve bank continue ass effect six-monthly financial stability report. this ask whether unintended consequences, whether policy intervention remain optimal. our ongoing assessment impact lvr policy inform adjustment calibration. the good news decline risk allow u ease lvr restrictions, start 2017. the outlook macroprudential policy we leave lvr policy unchanged may financial stability report, order monitor effect recent ease recent fall mortgage rates. look ahead, comfortable ease lvr policy time, predicate risk continue abate. specifically, want see household debt level remain stable relative incomes, prudent lend standard banks, moderate house price inflation. if condition met, incline continue ease restrictions. in long term, face choice remove lvr restriction maintain permissive setting. a full removal would course eliminate efficiency cost, could do alongside deployment le intrusive tool still worry residual risks. but flip side permanent lvr set continue guard risky form lending, may good prepare bank system adapt restrictive calibration risk re-emerge. the efficacy permanent lvr set important policy question future research. a may know, reserve bank propose material increase banks’ capital requirement increase resilience financial system. the proposal include prominent role counter-cyclical buffer, provide certainty buff build prior downturn financial cycle, order support lend systemic crisis.13 a consequence, macroprudential tools, include lvr restrictions, may need use le actively. that said, 13 the counter cyclical buff would release systemic downturn support lending. in contrast, unlikely ease lvrs downturn would benefit, bank reluctant undertake high-lvr lend stress. 13 different tool effective address different risks, still role borrower-based tool directly address risk associate household debt. part 4 – conclusion in conclusion, financial stability important wellbeing new zealanders, macroprudential policy key line defence safeguard financial stability. baseline prudential tool ensure potential threat financial system absorb damage repaired. macroprudential policy reduce likelihood severity threat, mitigate adverse impact economy. to inform strategy macroprudential policy, review operation lvr restriction policy since 2013 grow research macroprudential policy internationally. we find lvr restriction policy significantly improve resilience bank system. we also gain broad understand side effect lvr policy public policy areas, way mitigate potential policy tensions, limitation macroprudential policy. our experience lvr restriction help shape strategy use macroprudential policy. our strategy broadly follow three-step process systemic risk monitoring, policy choice, policy assessment, include evaluation implement macroprudential tools. we transparent accountable, outline tool use make case implementation. the government review role power reserve bank relate financial stability, include whether macroprudential framework remain fit purpose. the principle good governance i touch on, refresh macroprudential strategy, form anchor, compatible range outcome review. i hope refresh strategy macroprudential policy contribute understanding, accountability, last legitimacy framework. reference aikman, d., bridges, j., burgess, s., galletly, r., levina, i., o’neill, c., a. varadi (2018). “measuring risk uk financial stability”, bank england staff work paper no. 738. bascand, g.

3bis central bankers' speech claudia buch: welcome remark - macroprudential conference2019welcoming remark prof claudia buch, vice-president deutsche bundesbank, themacroprudential conference 2019, eltville, 21 june 2019.* * *the bundesbank proud host macroprudential conference series firsttime, i would like take opportunity welcome eltville. from myperspective, tradition conferences, initiate dutch national bankand swedish riksbank, two particularly important features:the first close interaction policymakers academics. in many ways,macroprudential policymaking enter unchartered territory, policy development haveoften leapfrog analytical work. a close dialogue researcher policymakers isthus essential order understand exist policy tool working, identify whetherwe miss relevant channels, learn function financialsystem, particularly time stress.the second feature need cooperation. it emphasise repeatedly thatmacroprudential policy necessary complement microprudential supervision regard toproviding system-wide perspective resilience financial system. this system doesnot end national borders. international cooperation coordination thus crucial itcomes macroprudential policymaking.let give two example demonstrate policy coordination fact working– highlight value interaction academia.1 coordination macroprudential policy nationally europemacroprudential policy core element post crisis reform agenda, play aparticularly important role european monetary union lack single sovereign (buchand weigert 2018). it enough focus sustainability public debt – mechanismsare need safeguard stability financial system. such mechanism ensure thatprivate credit sustainable failure service debt pose threat thestability financial system. macroprudential policy exactly objective: prevent thebuild-up systemic risk, i.e. risk destabilise negative externality financial system,and prevent excessive leverage private sector. macroprudential policy take amacroeconomic perspective financial sector’s health resilience. it complementsmonetary policy microprudential supervision.in europe, macroprudential policy national task – involve close coordination theeuropean level. understand coordination macroprudential policy –at nationaland supranational level – important: in monetary union high degree financialintegration, risk easily spill across borders.let give example: the german financial stability committee recently recommendedactivating countercyclical capital buff raise 25 basis points. thisrecommendation base analytical work bundesbank, president weidmannexplained morning. we warn over-optimism long period good growthperformance: credit risk might underestimated, market participant might overestimatethe value collateral. interest rate risk are, obviously, closely correlate risks.responsibility macroprudential policy germany share member financial1 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech stability committee (fsc): bundesbank, federal financial supervisory authority (bafin)as macroprudential authority, ministry finance chair committee. thecommittee issue warn recommendation financial stabilityconcerns. the institutional set-up implementation macroprudential policy often includesmore one institution. this bring expertise different view table, whichensures sound decision making. but decision-making process may also lengthened. thisimportant issue highlight today’s presentation nellie liang. in paper withrochelle edge, find “countries fscs strong governance mechanism aremore likely use ccyb”. a evidence policy decision accumulates, moreinstruments used, certainly learn design macroprudential policyand governance structures.an insightful example coordination political economy macroprudential policydecisions national level recommendation issue german fsc 2015.the committee recommend legislative action take regard macroprudentialinstruments house market and, importantly, legal basis create thecollection sufficiently granular data house loans. two year later, german parliamentpassed legislation include two recommend policy instrument – loan-to-value-capsand amortisation requirement – limit debt-service debt-to-income ratio weredropped proposal. thank close collaboration close coordination ofcommunication among fsc member able convince lawmaker include leasttwo recommend instruments. in sense, fsc act important hub toexchange view coordinate action head financial stability. this somethingwhich would much hard achieve without sound legal mandate designatedcommittee. however, argument two remain instrument still valid therestill remain data gap closed.governing macroprudential policy decision europe go beyond coordination nationallevel. domestic policy decision play important role also european financial system.the european systemic risk board (esrb) ecb financial stability committeeprovide cross-country view. the esrb macroprudential oversight body eu. it canissue confidential public warn identify significant systemic risks. furthermore,the esrb issue recommendation remedial action address identify risks. the ecbhas right top-up certain national measures, ccyb, thereby limit spill-overeffects might fully account national authorities.this provide laboratory research effect macroprudential policy coordination:how national policymakers react domestic european financial stability risks?which indicator guide policymaking, surveillance tool used?what role communication? how explain complex issue like financial stability,systemic risk macroprudential instruments, ccyb? what learnfrom other?the example give show macroprudential policymaking europe embed acomplex set institutional arrangements, ensure coordination national institutionsand countries. it may early tell whether institutional arrangement help toovercome inaction bias inherent macroprudential policy whether improve thesurveillance systemic risks. but evidence accumulates, certainly learn fromour experience improve exist frameworks, necessary.2 coordinate reform evaluation internationallya second example coordination fsb’s currently ongoing ex post policy evaluations.post-crisis financial sector reform agree global level order make sure 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech certain minimum standard apply jurisdictions. at time, many macroprudentialpolicies implement global financial crisis without precedent. thismeant macroprudential policy implement calibrate great uncertaintyas actual effects. now many policy put place initial experienceshave gained, position evaluate thus improve understand theireffects. policy evaluation provide information whether policy achieve objective orwhether unintended consequence materialise. policy evaluation, however, trivial task asit need answer three key questions:1. do reform “cause” outcome (attribution)?2. do reform similar effect across relevant markets, state world, orjurisdictions region (heterogeneity)?3. do reform achieve overall objective (aggregation/general equilibrium)?these question cannot answer take purely national perspective. recent work thefinancial stability board (fsb) good example internationally coordinate evaluationhas become part policy process: in 2017, german g20 presidency, fsbdeveloped framework evaluate effect g20 post-crisis reform financialregulation (financial stability board 2017). the fsb subsequently launch several evaluationprojects. three project already complete close finished:the first project provide evidence post-crisis reform generate incentive centrallyclear otc derivatives.the second project show material negative effect reform infrastructurefinancing.the third project analysis reform effect availability fund small medium-sized enterprises. the recently-published consultation report show persistent negativeeffects g20 regulatory reform sme finance overall.ongoing evaluation work fsb deal one g20’s core objective – reduce thesystemic moral hazard risk associate systemically important financial institutions. afirst evaluation plan publish fsb’s website. workshop hold withstakeholders academia, financial sector, representative civil society.the too-big-to-fail (tbtf) evaluation address three main questions:1. be reform effective reduce perceive probability impact failure ofsystemically important institutions? this question address assess changesin estimate implicit fund subsidy analyse progress resolvability ofsystemically important banks.2. be reform result alter bank behaviour term change fund structures,asset allocation risk-taking?3. what broad effect reforms? such effect include function thefinancial system, market fragmentation, cost availability finance realeconomy.focusing experience individual country sufficient answer thesequestions. financial system differ regard competitive structure type ofinstitutions involved. reform effect thus likely differ across countries. researchconducted international bank research network, instance, show prudentialinstruments sometimes spill across border bank lending, internationalspillovers vary across prudential instrument heterogeneous across banks. thereappears one channel indeed, specific direction transmission predominate in2345 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech context spillovers. understand heterogeneity implication resilience iscrucially important.3 sum upmacroprudential policy new policy field offer lot unchartered territory exploredby basic academic research policy-oriented apply research. with fsb evaluationframework evaluation initiated, policy maker also explicitly acknowledge theimportance academia support evidence-based policy make improve accountability.therefore, i invite academic research community join evaluation process: either bydirectly contribute on-going envisage project critically follow processto ensure analytical result policy conclusion match.referencesbuch, c. m. b. weigert (2018),

youth days;a book start powerful notion – “happy family alike; every unhappy familyis unhappy way” – might recall tolstoy’s “anna karenina”. few day after, whilesearching recent discussion matter capitalism, inequality, wealthdistribution, i read analytical piece author cite quote, link thedifferent modality inequality, symbol global unhappiness. standard metric oninequality point widespread rise phenomenon. it obviously underpin risingpopulism, reflect dissatisfaction system create equalopportunities everyone, system reward merit based, i.e., system graduallyevolves crony capitalism. against background, i doubt chosenthe perfect spotlight constituency meeting.let shortly use historical lens – question sustainability capitalism ledto marxism stagnation wage concentration wealth early phase ofindustrial revolution. it give grind rise inequality, thomas pikketty, so-called“modern marx” reveal book “capital twenty-first century”, exception fromthis rise trend global inequality period 1914 1970s, historical outlier. indeed, actual data indicate rise income inequality since 1980s onwards almostacross board, although different intensity. this turn point often associate withthe end so-called “post-war egalitarian regime” around globe. to bring point closer,let refer data retrieve 2018 world inequality report, reveal in1980, income share top 10% income distribution western europe, northamerica, china india around 30–35%. by 2016, percentage rise around 35–40%in western europe, increase region stronger, reach 45%-50% ofthe total income. one might notice remarkable difference income concentration thetop-level earner western europe us, mean inequality diverge substantially inthese two group last almost four decades.this so-called “modern” surge divergence inequality lead economist wondering, whichforces may prevent benefit capitalism widely distributed. observe u –europe nexus, apparently level development always matter incomedistribution could look like. there policy tool fundamental value society canaffect distribution curve markedly. for instance, many author associate divergence inwestern europe u educational inequality le progressive tax

income groups. hence, equal opportunity high qualityeducation, particular nowadays technology rapidly advance could one theremedies “illness” inequality. it could enable young people bottom incomedistribution get access better-paid jobs, hence flatten income distribution curve.in region-specific context despite transition, process principle lead increase ininequality, top 10% income distribution share close 29% total income,lower compare western europe.apparently, issue rise unequal income distribution neither new, world beenshielded tectonic change systems, example transition europe,which “fertile soil” rise inequality. however, last ten year wewitnessed substantial proliferation literature, academic political debate theroots consequence rise income inequality. it financial crisis bring theissue fore. even more, author link severity financial crisis itsunexpected spell, exactly uneven societies. in book “fault lines”, raghuram rajanargued rise inequality past three decade lead political pressure redistributionthat eventually come form subsidize house finance, root theglobal crisis.whether policy central bank affect income distribution gain lot attention,as well. i would say pure fact inherently face heterogeneity acrosshouseholds term primary source income – capital labor – respect totheir position saver, borrower naturally imply monetary impact, least theshort-term, could differ along groups. macro-prudential measures, design targetedand selectively use tackle identify point vulnerability. purchase different type ofassets, also significantly alter price financial market different wealtheffects. still, give rationale feature central bank policies, ben bernanke(2015) states: “by comparison influence (these) long-term factors, effect ofmonetary policy inequality almost certainly modest transient”. these long-termfactors influence inequality relate globalization, technological progress, demographic trends,and institutional change labor market.how tackle chronic problem uneven income distribution, seem asymptom many fundamental weakness system? how return greatness theopportunities modern society bring? should way forward strong regulation,more active redistributive role state prof. zingales claim harness thepower competition? a economists, know market base system inherently bringssome inequality, disruptive power unthinkable boundary crossed. at thecurrent juncture, global growth slowdown horizon pro–growth pro–equalitypolicies seem inevitable. i sure distinguish speaker panelist reflect thearray available policies,

environments.we, policymakers, cannot role “innocent bystanders”, scrutinize andstocktaking, put place reform promote strong inclusive growth itsnature reduce inequality. thus instead re-slicing pie focus need ensuringthat pie get big inclusive, lead le unhappiness thedimensions might appear. i truly hope distant future, witness moderation income gaps,more prosperous le unequal societies. this require commitment, willingness visionby policymakers. somehow, seem appropriate end i began, tolstoy quotation:“тhere one time important— now! it important time 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech time

bankers' speech japan's economy monetary policy speech meet business leader aomori bank japan june 27, 2019 masazumi wakatabe deputy governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction good morning. it pleasure opportunity today exchange view administrative, financial, business leader aomori prefecture. this first meet kind since start reiwa era. aomori prefecture bless rich natural environment shirakami mountains, register world heritage site, lake towada, hakkoda mountains. it long history represent jomon clay figurine designate national treasure, well sannai-maruyama site. it also area distinguish rich culture produce many intellectual artists, shoeki ando (philosopher), osamu dazai (novelist), shuji terayama (poet playwright), noriko awaya (singer). the bank japan's aomori branch establish 1946. i hear that, due shortage material time, great difficulty construct branch building. since then, branch operate present owe support people region. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation activity branch. today, i would like hear view current status local economy, well candid opinion bank's policy activities. first, i briefly explain development japan's economic activity, talk bank's conduct monetary policy, regional financial institution japan, economic development aomori prefecture. i. economic development a. economic improvement since 2013 first, i would like take look japan's economy change quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) bank introduce april 2013. look back, japan's economy suffer significant downturn due global financial crisis 2008, thereafter remain pre-crisis level around 2012. in contrast, since 2013, follow improve trend bank's monetary easing, albeit fluctuation (chart 1). domestic demand private consumption business fix investment increase considerably previous recovery phase around 2002-2008, despite slow growth external demand (chart 2). this 2 suggest that, even amid weak tailwind overseas, well-balanced economic growth materialize domestic demand stimulate strongly, partly various policy measures. the well-balanced growth japan's economy since 2013 also evidence improvement employment income situation. labor market condition continue tighten steadily japan, active job openings-to-applicants ratio rise level see 1970s unemployment rate decline level observe early 1990s (chart 3). a notable feature improvement substantial increase number employ person employees. this show tight labor market condition current phase attributable increase labor demand, rather decrease labor supply result decline working-age population. if labor market condition tightened, due mainly decline labor supply, number employee would decline since number wish work would decrease wage unchanged labor supply curve would shift leave (chart 4).1 in reality, number employee continue increase, along moderate rise wages, therefore employee income continue register relatively high growth. such improvement employment income situation, together generally favorable corporate profits, support solid domestic demand. b. effect monetary ease i think bank's monetary ease contribute greatly achieve economic growth, domestic external demand increase well-balanced manner 1 compare fact number employ person employee increase significantly since 2013, wage increase relatively weak. this suggest labor supply curve could shift right -- direction indicate labor supply increased. although continue decline working-age population age 15-64 contribute shift labor supply curve left, possibility mainly woman senior become will work, due progress labor market reform enable various work styles, extension healthy life expectancy, rise expectation labor market condition remain tight. firm seem address demographic change include decline birthrate age population proactively by, example, take various step secure labor force expand labor-saving investment, rather merely consider change constraints. 3 accompany improvement employment income situation. in follows, i explain effect monetary ease since 2013, describe change financial condition impact economic price developments. let start change financial conditions. since introduction qqe 2013, japan's interest rate decline significantly. the decline interest rate stimulate private sector's credit demand improve financial institutions' lend attitudes. these result clear increase amount outstanding fund private sector (chart 5). there considerable evidence finance environment firm improve considerably monetary easing. i move effect monetary ease economic activity prices. it say lead upturn economic price situation by, example, produce accommodative financial condition influence people's expectations, well resultant rise asset prices. since actual economic price condition subject various factors, easy quantify effect monetary ease alone. that said, let introduce one simulation economic activity price would develop since 2013 bank's qqe introduce (chart 6). although estimation result interpret certain latitude, analysis suggest (1) qqe strongly stimulate economic activity price through, example, decline interest rates, (2) without qqe, highly likely current situation japan's economy long deflation could achieve amid continuous shortage demand.2 2 the simulation show chart 6 base vector auto-regressive (var) model consist follow variables: monetary base, interest rate different maturities, output gap, consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food energy, foreign exchange rate. the future path output gap cpi simulate assume shock interest rate monetary base. the result generally consistent present bank's comprehensive assessment release september 2016, estimate effect qqe economic price development base large-scale semi-structural model japan's economy. 4 the effect monetary ease exert indirectly mainly interest rate people cannot feel easily. however, i would like emphasize monetary ease fact underpin economy firmly various aspect i explain earlier. c. current situation outlook japan's economy i describe far japan's economy improve trend since 2013 bank's monetary easing. however, export production relatively weak since early year amid grow concern deceleration overseas economy (chart 7). on point, bank currently ass japan's economy maintain moderate expand trend, although export production affect slowdown overseas economies. the monetary ease sustain steady domestic demand. also, outlook, main scenario economy likely continue expand moderately trend, growth rate overseas economy rise somewhat domestic demand maintain firmness (chart 8). more recently, however, attention need pay downside risk main scenario. the late economic outlook international organization international monetary fund (imf) also point that, although global economic growth rate project increase somewhat second half 2019, scenario entail substantial uncertainties. most notably, trade friction unite state china involve significant issue beyond mere economic problem -- competition advance technology national security -- may difficult resolve issue fundamentally short period time. the negotiation two country still underway, pessimistic. if trade friction become prolong persistent, however, downward pressure global economy may heighten direct effect tariff hike also 5 deterioration firms' fix investment stance financial market sentiment.3 in europe, uncertainty political development include negotiation unite kingdom's exit european union (eu) remain high, middle east, example, geopolitical risk warrant careful attention. if slowdown overseas economy become prolonged, downward pressure domestic demand may strengthen gradually. in addition, remain risk schedule consumption tax hike october may push domestic demand eventually economic activity prices. ii. conduct monetary policy a. why be price stability target 2 percent necessary? next, i talk conduct monetary policy. the bank conduct monetary ease policy view achieve price stability target 2 percent. at previous meet business leader hold niigata last december, i elaborate bank set price stability target 2 percent.4 set target level 2 percent global standard; low target, deflationary pressure would exert change people's expectation well foreign exchange rate asset prices. in addition, bank consider sufficient price go up; rather, think achieve 2 percent target contribute sound development national economy -- example, increase nominal gdp, corporate profits, household income, number employees, well fiscal soundness. a rise labor cost point recent year one factor behind price rises. labor cost are, words, wage salaries. increase wage salary lead price rises, also true 3 accord g-20 surveillance note write imf staff june, estimate global gdp likely low 0.5 percent 2020, take account impact increase tariff 200 billion dollars' worth unite state import china 10 percent 25 percent, possible 25 percent tariff roughly 267 billion dollars' worth unite state import china, tariff hike already conduct 2018. for details, see https://www.imf.org/external/np/g20/pdf/2019/060519.pdf. 4 masazumi wakatabe, "japan's economy monetary policy," speech meet business leader niigata, december 5, 2018, http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/press/koen_2018/data /ko181205a1.pdf. 6 firm able raise wage salary situation cannot increase price product services. in speech, i would like explain bank's monetary policy somewhat different perspective. the reiwa era started. most heisei era, last january 1989 april 2019, one deflation, mark battle it. unfortunately, economic activity also stagnate period. while various view explain cause deflation, note utmost seriousness japan fell prolong deflation among advance economies, rest achieve inflation around 2 percent time.5 however, bank's price stability target 2 percent, japan's economy long deflation. since introduction qqe april 2013 particular, inflation rate average increase around 0.5 percent negative territory around 0.5 percent positive territory. this improvement achieve bank's clear commitment 2 percent target monetary ease pursue line (chart 9). b. cause low interest rates: decline natural rate interest that said, inflation rate yet reach 2 percent, range 0.5-1.0 percent exclude fresh food, therefore bank's monetary ease continue long period time. in situation, request high interest rates. some may think bank raise interest rate control wants. but reality simple.6 5 kataoka goushi, nihon "ushinawareta 20-nen": defure koeru keizai seisaku ni mukete (tokyo: fujiwara-shoten, 2010); masazumi wakatabe, japan's great stagnation abenomics: lesson world (new york: palgrave macmillan, 2015); takenaka heizo, heisei kyōkun: kaikaku gusaku 30-nen (tokyo: php institute, inc., 2019); iwata kikuo, naze defure hōchi shite wa ikenai ka: hitode busoku keizai de yomigaeru abenomikusu (tokyo: php institute, inc., 2019). 6 for one example answer question unite states, see stanley fischer, "why be interest rate so low? cause implications," remark economic club new york, october 17, 2016, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20161017a.htm. 7 why interest rate remain low first place? interest rate low japan advance economies. in economics, say want raise rate, cut first; want cut rate, raise first. a central bank low interest rate economy slip downturn high risk deflation. then, inflation rate go up, reflect economic recovery, central bank raise interest rate accordingly. let elaborate this. monetary policy today base follow understanding. the level interest rate balance save investment neither accelerate decelerate economy call natural rate interest, equilibrium real interest rate. a central bank conduct monetary policy use natural rate interest reference point. specifically, time economic downturn, central bank stimulate economy guide actual interest rate level natural rate interest. when economy overheated, central bank raise interest rate level natural rate interest. a natural rate interest estimate base theoretical model entail uncertainties, interpret certain latitude.7 with mind, i would say natural rate interest decline many advance economy include japan (chart 10). in case japan, natural rate interest decline sharply early 1990s. in advance economies, rate decrease since global financial crisis. this suggest natural rate interest affect bubble burst well financial economic crises. generally speaking, reason behind decline natural rate interest one following: increase savings, decrease 7 jerome h. powell, "monetary policy change economy," speech symposium title "changing market structure implication monetary policy" hold jackson hole sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, august 24, 2018, https://www.federalreserve.gov /newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm; richard h. clarida, "models, markets, monetary policy," speech hoover institution monetary policy conference title "strategies monetary policy" hold stanford university, may 3, 2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov /newsevents/speech/clarida20190503a.htm. 8 investment, combination two. for example, household firm seek increase save event economic crisis, supply fund economy increase natural rate interest decline. if growth expectation deteriorate due partly economic crisis decrease productivity, thereby firm become le will make investment, actual investment decrease natural rate interest consequently decline. demographic change decline birthrate age population also point cause decline natural rate interest.8 moreover, say global save glut play major role others point possibility "secular stagnation."9 in case natural rate interest decline reason, central bank need low interest rate accordingly otherwise economy deflationary pressure. in japan, short-term nominal interest rate already reach close 0 percent since 1990s. in light situation, bank take measure (1) low long-term interest rate purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), (2) introduce negative interest rate policy guide short-term nominal interest rate negative territory, (3) adopt inflation-overshooting commitment, bank continue expand monetary base year-on-year rate increase observe cpi exceed 2 percent stay level stable manner, (4) 8 the follow study examine effect demographic change natural rate interest. assume decline labor force low economic growth rate extension longevity result increase savings, study estimate 270 basis point attribute demographic change 640 basis point decline real interest rate past 50 year japan. nao sudo yasutaka takizuka, "population age real interest rate last next 50 years: a tale tell overlap generation model," bank japan work paper series, no.18-e-1, january 2018, https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev /wps_2018/data/wp18e01.pdf. however, attention pay fact study take account effect financial crisis factor cause decline natural rate interest. 9 secular stagnation refer situation aggregate demand economy remain potential supply capacity long time, result decline capacity. for detail decline natural rate interest secular stagnation, see collection paper lawrence h. summers, ben s. bernanke, paul krugman, alvin h. hansen keiki kaifuku ga kanjirarenai wa nazeka: chōki teitai ronsō, ed. trans. hiroo yamagata (kyoto: sekaishisosha co., ltd., 2019), available japanese. 9 introduce forward guidance state bank intend maintain current extremely low level short- long-term interest rate extend period time. once economy fall deflation, household firm strengthen expectation deflation may continue. especially deflation last long time japan, expectation heighten further. in case, firm household perceive interest rate high actually low level nominal interest rates. we call perceive interest rates, take account inflation expectations, real interest rates. the bank's price stability target 2 percent expect encourage firm household strongly hold expectation price rise steadily, result decline real interest rates. the word "normalization" often use regard monetary policy, ambiguous term unclear definition. the ultimate objective monetary policy sound development national economy. in words, economic price situation normalize monetary policy also normalized.10 the bank continue monetary ease long necessary achieve price stability target 2 percent sustainable manner. c. discussion monetary policy framework amid low interest rate low inflation observe globally, central bank academic discussion mainly regard monetary policy framework. the bank canada review monetary policy framework every five years; federal reserve 10 argument raise interest rate include "theory ammunition." accord this, central bank raise interest rate advance -- load gun ammunition -- otherwise cannot low interest rate next economic downturn occurs. of course, price stability target achieve sustainable manner, interest rate likely increase reflect inflation. however, interest rate hike price stability target achieve instead bring economic downturn, counterproductive. 10 recently discuss whether update framework.11 key point discussion include summarize following.12 first, experience japan's battle deflation u.s. european economy follow global financial crisis, policy tool qqe, negative interest rate policy, forward guidance add central banks' "arsenal." they use go forward depend situation. second, inflation target framework prove effective even time global financial crisis aftermath, point that, even unite states, economic price development relatively firm, interest rate remain low room monetary policy response become small before. under circumstances, ongoing debate unite state economy monetary policy framework adopt view achieve medium- long-term price stability. various approach proposed, set high inflation target introduce average inflation targeting, price-level targeting, inflation target range, nominal gdp target (chart 11). every approach advantage challenges. of course, japan cannot treat economy unite states, inflation rate already around 2 percent. the bank judge present appropriate maintain current policy framework clearly commit price stability target 2 percent pursue monetary ease achieve target. that said, i think necessary bank work sufficiently study toward good monetary policy. 11 regard bank canada's review monetary policy framework date, see https://www.bankofcanada.ca/agreement-inflation-control-target/. a feed listen event federal reserve proceed with, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy /review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fed-listens-events.htm. 12 with regard challenge outlook monetary policy present, follow paper ben s. bernanke, former chair federal reserve, informative. see ben s. bernanke, "monetary policy new era," evolution revolution? rethink macroeconomic policy great recession, ed. olivier blanchard lawrence h. summer (cambridge: the mit press, 2019), pp.3-48. 11 iii. regional financial institution japan next, i would like talk regional financial institution japan. needle say, play extremely useful role regional economies. with accommodative monetary policy last long period time, challenge face regional financial institution japan impact monetary policy come draw attention. japan's financial system characterize follows. first, indirect finance dominant. indirect finance form finance depositary financial institution bank play significant role firms' funding. second, particularly regional financial institutions, ratio deposit overall financial liability high corporate bond equity low. third, regional financial institution particular depend deposit-taking lend activities. however, financial institutions, region japan whole, enter phase drastic changes. structural change take place, decline population aging, globalization, well technological innovation evidence new entry settlement business outside financial sector. national account data show corporate sector become net lender fund since mid-1990s (chart 12). this also relate decline natural rate interest i mention earlier. even among small medium-sized firms, ratio so-called de facto debt-free firm -- define firm cash deposit exceed total amount borrow -- continue increase, recently exceed 40 percent.13 structural factor lie behind decline financial institutions' profits. interest rate use high worldwide, reflect high inflation high natural rate interest. however, unfortunately, unlikely environment realize soon. at regional financial institutions, although net income remain high long run, pre-provision net revenue (ppnr) continue follow decline trend. the financial system report release april show profit simulation next 10 years. the result suggest half domestic regional bank expect run 13 accord teikoku databank. 12 deficit 10 year borrow demand corporate sector continue decline pace past. of course, note result need interpret latitude calculate base certain assumption (chart 13). here, worth refer case financial institution europe, negative interest rate policy introduced, japan. the financial system report compare financial institution europe japan. under negative interest rate policy, former make high profit latter. this partly fund cost financial institution europe decrease background low interest rate environment last short period japan, therefore room decline deposit interest rates. also, europe, share deposit fund overall financial liability low, cost market finance issue corporate bond declining. moreover, financial institution europe secure various source revenue unsusceptible change interest rate by, example, diversify fee service (chart 14). for high profitability go forward, hop regional financial institution (1) set lend rate reflect risk appropriately, (2) depart excessive dependence deposit-taking lend activity by, example, increase fee-based income, (3) drastically improve business efficiency.14 to push forward initiative strongly effectively, use digital technology, integration partner among financial institutions, alliance firm outside financial industry effective options. the bank continue support effort financial institutions. iv. economic development aomori prefecture now, i would like talk economy aomori prefecture. look current developments, economic activity aomori prefecture moderate recovery 14 for discussion base comparison financial institution japan overseas, see hiroshi nakaso, "new frontier macroprudential policy: address financial institutions' low profitability intensify competition," speech kin'yu konwa kai (financial discussion meeting) host jiji press, november 29, 2017, http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements /press/koen_2017/ko171129a.htm/. 13 trend, albeit slow pace. the production growth decelerated, reflect weak overseas demand. business sentiment primarily manufacture firm become cautious, thus business fix investment le flat. meanwhile, labor market condition continue tighten, private consumption maintain recovery trend employee income improving. let touch economic structure prefecture. the prefecture experience continue decline population 20 year long japan overall face shrink internal demand. during time, take initiative invite firm manage maintain economic scale attract demand prefecture -- mainly tokyo metropolitan area -- overseas. it seem easy, however, keep economic scale go forward population already start decrease across country. that said, i also felt visit

zhou xiaochuan, executivedeputy secretary-general ding xuedong, mayor ying yong, governor yi gang, chairman yihuiman, lady gentlemen,good morning!as rotate co-chair forum, behalf host, i would like extend warmwelcome friend old new. the annual lujiazui forum hold successfullyten times. we glad see that, shanghai accelerate step establish aninternational financial center, amaze world great achievements. in future, thecentral financial regulator continue support opening-up reform ofshanghai, try upmost whatever do. yesterday, shanghai municipalleaders criticize come often. i regret it’s true. but, long vicepremier liu grant approval, soon tomorrow i would move office pudong.currently, financial system china operate soundly, thus provide solid guarantee forthe comprehensive deepen reform high-quality development chineseeconomy. under leadership party central committee comrade xi jinping thecore, line overall arrangement financial stability developmentcommittee state council, financial system firmly implement new developmentphilosophy, vigorously promote supply-side structural reform, continuously optimize theinstitutional system, market system product system, strive provide real economyand people effective financial service good quality. in process, thefollowing aspect need highlighted.first, financial institution must remain commit customer-oriented operate philosophy.in 1978, china aggregate financial asset le rmb200 billion, saw acuteshortage financial products. today, aggregate financial asset exceed rmb400trillion. despite this, financial institution still long way go customer service andmarket segmentation. fifteen year ago start introduce shareholding system inlarge-sized state-owned banks, hard task eliminate “bureaucratic way ofhandling commerce”. in 2005, expert american bank come help u reform bankoutlets. for weeks, go save agency, patiently ask every customer aboutthe service received, put every detail transactions. our colleague wereconfused, even mock american unwise rigid. however, whenthe expert present accurate analysis reports, everyone astonished. after that, ourcolleagues consult american counterparts, think improvement theirown initiative. a result, business process chinese bank gradually approach sixsigma method, productivity get close even surpass world’s top-notchbanks. today, avail information technology internet, artificialintelligence, big data, china’s financial institution continuously witness revolutionarychanges technological capabilities, product development conduct paceincreasingly close world’s lead institutions. however, offer effective financialservices build shanghai world financial center, crucially, financial institutionsmust put interest concern customer first place.second, effort make develop specialize personalize financialinstitutions. china 5,000 license financial institutions, ten thousand 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech unlicensed institution engage quasi-financial businesses. however, compare withdeveloped countries, penetration rate banks, depth density insurancebusinesses, influence capital market china remain low level.financial institution le diversify classification, unreasonable distribution, andindistinct characteristics. moreover, phenomenon “excessive competition” “serviceblank” coexist. with new development fintech, mean feasible simply copythe development path country term industrial pattern, profitability model, andcorporate structure. instead, work increase number financial institutionsand improve level quality. we support small medium-sized institutionsserving community small micro business (smbs), encourage practice ofthe spirit “collecting data street street” “walking village households”; supportspecialized dedicate financial enterprises, encourage form distinct corporateculture appropriate main businesses; support kind distinctive financialinstitutions closely integrate offline online business combine traditional andmodern features. in process, warmly welcome involvement overseas financialinstitutions opening-up china’s banking, insurance, securities, trust sectors.we especially welcome experience asset management institutions, along domesticcounterparts, raise rmb capital invest rmb-denominated security market.third, finance market system must good suit life cycle enterprises.enterprises different development stage finance need different nature feature.venture capital suit finance feature startups; bank credit favorable forenterprises growth stage; bonds, stocks, direct finance tool greatimportance relatively mature businesses. by structure, bank credit account 80% ofthe aggregate financing, equity finance make 10%. basically speaking,the bond market quasi-credit market lack depth commercial bank majorplayers, bond product characterize poor variety transaction scenario remainsless lively. meanwhile, due excessive reliance banks, enterprise cannot well match theirlife cycle production cycle. a result, large medium-sized enterprise likely tosqueeze others excessively occupy credit resources, whereas smbs innovation-driven enterprise may difficulty secure necessary financial support hatchingstage. therefore, basis strong consensus, financial regulator enterprise mustwork concertedly develop china’s capital market completely change imbalancebetween direct finance indirect financing.fourth, measure take establish improve corporate governance structurewith chinese characteristics. unsound corporate governance always intrinsicproblem china’s economy, enormous loss cause major shareholders’manipulation institution insider control others. since vast majority offinancial institution are, nature, strongly correlate public interests, financialinstitutions place emphasis corporate governance structure. we makecontinued effort establish modern corporate system enhance party leadership, asto set mechanism proactive cooperation mutual restriction institution ofcorporate governance. we also carry hangzhou summit declaration ensureprior implementation g20-oecd corporate governance consensus financial sector.fifth, sufficiently harsh punishment promptly impose violator law andregulations. for time, institution disclose false information, manipulate thequality categorization assets, even recklessly falsify accounts, undermine thecredibility financial sector. these problem attribute number reasons, yetthe principal one include failure implement capital rules, unsound corporategovernance, feeble market control, negligent oversight law enforcement. the low cost ofviolating rule regulation result trample laws. therefore, regulatorsmust courage fight, ensure strict enforcement laws, resolutely safeguardthe sanctity laws. for two years, bank insurance regulator 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech seriously deal institution accountable violate law regulations, imposingpenalties 8,000 person/times, confiscate rmb6 billion fromrelevant institutions. a series stringent regulatory measure take crack onfalsified asset categorization account fraud, rmb4 trillion nonperformingloans dispose of.sixth, determine change distribution financial assets. at present, china’sbank save deposit amount rmb78.7 trillion, asset management products, whichare essentially similar bank deposits, total rmb60 trillion. in addition, anequally considerable sum corporate deposit enormous idle fund society. how totransform fund long-term stable source investment capital institutionalinvestors, important yet urgent issue must addressed. we vigorouslydevelop various institutional investor include publicly offer funds, privately offer funds,insurers, trusts, wealth management companies. in way, change investorcomposition dominate retail investor foster market atmosphere favorable long-terminvestment value investing, raise scale stable fund market well asthe efficiency investment conversion. in term pension funds, draw theexperience country construct three pillars, namely basic social security funds,enterprise annuities, commercial insurance, bid raise scale china’s pensionfunds capital market world average.seventh, must firmly prevent resurgence structurally complex products. china boaststhe large new capital input among economy world, challenge task toraise efficiency fund utilization. the key avoid diversion investment thereal economy continuously clean fund circulate solely within financialsector. for two years, remain commit rectification marketirregularities dismantle shadow banks, achieve net reduction rmb13.74 trillion ofhigh-risk assets, consequently shorten finance chain low finance costs.currently, sign relax regulation world promote resurgence shadowbanks, require u ever vigilant. the diversion investment real economyand multi-layer nest investment china’s financial sector among severe ofthe kind, must prevent replay past.eighth, must face problem financialization real estate part ofchina. in recent years, leverage ratio household sector chinese city haverisen rapidly, debt ratio considerable proportion household reach anunsustainable level. more seriously, around half new save resource invest intothe real estate sector. the excessive finance real estate sector crowd outcredit resource industries, also encourage investment speculation sectorand cause big bubble. when buy house live in, mean incomeof market rent equal amount expenditure month, also mean yourhouse generate equal amount add value; buy another house rent out, youwill also income output; however, buy house solely investment orspeculation, rather rental income, pile unused cement, bars, bricks.real estate mark regional differentials, normal house price rise fall indifferent regions. nevertheless, “housing live in, speculation.” history provedthat every country rely excessively real estate economic prosperity would eventually paya heavy price. all resident enterprise rely blind investment speculation realestate manage money eventually find really cost-efficient.at present, chinese economy crucial stage transformation upgrade andstructural reform, transition old new driver growth keep accelerating. ascontinuous improvement make financial sector’s capability serve realeconomy, fund inject bank insurance sector business grow rapidly, and,in particular, loan issue manufacture high-tech industry private enterprise 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech rebound significantly, relieve difficulty smbs face access affordable financing.by end-may, inclusive financial loan issue five major bank smbs grow 23.7%compared end last year, fulfil majority full-year plan. the average interestrate 4.79%, report decline 0.65 percentage point compare full year rate forlast year. meanwhile, bank insurance sector fully cooperate localgovernments issuance general bond special bonds, earnestly implementingdecisions plan make state provide finance support project launch tobolster weak spot infrastructure construction. we believe that, deepen supply-side structural reform expand effective domestic demand, effect various impedimentswill offset certain. the chinese economy financial sector surely achievesustained, healthy, steady growth!these idea present reference.to conclude, i wish forum complete success.thank you! 4 / 4bis central bankers' speech 9th annual general meet of ghana association of save and loan company address by mrs. elsie addo awazdi second deputy governor bank of ghana the coconut groove regency hotel, ridge, accra june 20, 2019 1 mr. chairman, executive ghana association save loan company (ghasalc), ceos/managing director member institutions, financial institutions, executive industry associations, invite guests, distinguish lady gentlemen, 1. good morning thank opportunity join 9th annual general meet ghasalc. almost decade establishment, association become recognise voice member institutions, bank ghana always welcome opportunity dialogue ghasalc membership. 2. the choose theme “business sustainability: a share responsibility” could appropriate time in. sustainability business critical, go achieve socio-economic growth need move country forward. save loan companies, like deposit-taking institutions, exist intermediate save order business economic actor obtain access much-needed fund meet legitimate needs. save loan company therefore major enabler 2 sustainable business must understand role, well played, provide boost overall socio-economic growth development. what more, i need remind save loan company business must therefore sustainable order able support customer entire economy. a nation, future economy wellbeing people depend large extent safety soundness individual financial institutions, extension, sustainability whole sector. it therefore imperative stakeholder work together towards build strong sustainable financial institution common good people. 3. we unfortunately see recent demise number bank microfinance institutions, owe weak capitalisation, unsustainable business models, poor corporate governance, poor compliance regulatory requirements, default contractual obligations, among others, ultimately lead insolvency eventual collapse. let clear business fail kind reasons, weakness i outline undoubtedly leave business vulnerable unable withstand shocks, make collapse inevitable. indeed, several corporate failure around world associate weak compliance. example fail businesses, medici bank collapse italy 1494, failure thousand save loan company unite state 1980s 1990s, failure bank credit commerce international 3 1991, bar bank 1995, recent bank failure u.s, eu, nigeria, associate poor corporate governance culture weak regulatory compliance. for financial institution especially, trust confidence critical lost, business sustainability become difficult. a say goes, trust come foot bolt horseback. 4. the focus agm build sustainable businesses, therefore timely. now good time ass current state save loan (s & l) subsector, view build sustainable business model benefit stakeholder broad economy. 5. lady gentlemen, i say earlier, financial intermediation central economic growth poverty alleviation. this intermediation role play bank sector save deposit take institution economy. within financial sector, s & l company lower-tier financial service company expect provide financial access rather large informal sector mostly characterize unbanked underserved population. financial access segment society help improve livelihoods, also contribute positively sustainable development country. 6. within ghanaian context, therefore, potential role s&ls financial intermediation cannot overemphasized. it however important note intermediation thrive trust confidence financial system. the security fund entrust financial institution demand 4 govern manage sound prudent manner preserve confidence depositor investors. this also imply deposit take institution must adhere good corporate governance practice build strong risk management system safeguard stability financial sector. 7. mr. chairman, ghana’s save loan sub-sector make 39 company end march 2019, dominate specialise deposit-taking institution (sdi) sector, account 44.6 percent total sdi assets. in march 2019, total asset sector increase gh¢7,977.63 million, gh¢6,548.63 million year earlier. 8. mr. chairman, despite growth total assets, s & l company continue face poor asset quality, solvency liquidity challenges. indeed, regulators, observe worry trend require attention stakeholders. in addition liquidity solvency issues, several financial soundness indicator industry adversely deviate accept statutory prudential benchmarks. these outcome primarily due business model adopt (not all) s&ls, essentially attract term-deposit fund unsustainably-high cost deploy fund risky asset without adequate risk management system manage monitor inherent risk exposures. poor credit underwrite

governor & head operation 2 ref #8022722 v2.0 renew rbnz’s approach financial stability good afternoon, it’s good today. i’m go talk reserve bank’s role ensure financial stability approach prudential regulation supervision evolve line own, society’s, risk tolerance.1 you’ll hear talk bank’s approach expand become intensive, active address vulnerability financial sector. this response experience, publicly identify need formal review approach.2 we build capability undertake deep analysis risk financial system shift intensive supervisory model. it’s busy time bank also undertake treasury fundamental review statutory framework deliver financial stability. the government announce in-principle decision modernise reserve bank govern objectives, power regulatory perimeter. these decision strengthen financial stability focus set foundation enhance performance, capability accountability financial stability functions. our ‘soundness efficiency’ objective replace explicit financial

crisis uncommon country. but evidence wide range country many decade show u happen, crisis damage long-lasting effects. they impact business households, reduce economic activity lose output. they result increase unemployment cost taxpayers. not that, recovery take decade often halt nature. put another way, financial instability create inefficiency waste large scale. reduce likelihood severity episode therefore heart mission. our aim new zealand dynamic efficient financial system contribute sustainable productive economy. the financial system expose risks… risk financial stability come wide

highly indebted households. and recent financial stability report note risk technology disruptions, misconduct cybercrime, insurance affordability climate change. we also consider vulnerability financial system. it relatively small, dominate handful institution similar underlie business models. that mean distress failure one major institution likely significant implication system whole. and remain alert new risks. history tell u wide variety trigger financial instability. every financial crisis different. …and subject market failure financial stability common resource benefit u all. but common resource, also prone tragedy common – risk abuse degrade individual agent right incentive look it, least internalise cost instability impose others. view lens, 4 ref #8022722 v2.0 maintain financial stability depend market participant will able identify, price, allocate manage risk appropriately.3 information asymmetry – one party transaction know – exacerbate free-riding problem. small retail saver likely find difficult detect price high risk-taking financial institution, although wholesale investor exert discipline. in addition factor limit incentive financial institution

regulate entities, investors, depositor ultimately taxpayers. these structural market failure tend reinforce behavioural factors. it well recognise individually rational people make decision basis people’s credit risk assessments.4 this herd behaviour create market momentum drive price away underlie risk returns. in absence objective information fundamental economic value asset trade, reinforce

address issue emerge country navigate current turbulent waters, particular deal potential financial market volatility. page 7 10 a i argue earlier: experience last year show portfolio investor

while risk indeed elevated, several factor nonetheless help insulate market good early crises. first, emerge country enjoy good coverage ratio fx reserves, even historical experience reveal that, fundamental weak, high reserve may offer much protection market volatility. second, inflation expectation appear good anchor broad range emerge countries, direct consequence grow credibility

need address future bout local market volatility reduce size duration. i would like mention, particular, grow indebtedness corporate sector and, less extent, also household government sectors, mean that, emerge page 8 10 countries, total debt (public plus private) well excess level prevail global financial crisis. similarly, increase fx liability (mostly private sector) and, several cases, grow

gdp growth performance weak, contribute relatively high fiscal current account deficit relative vulnerability south african assets. consequently, emerge market policymakers also focus measure increase ability domestic private agent adjust external shocks, include mobility labour capital across sectors. these measure include low page 10 10 constraint business, create opportunity laid-off worker ‘retrain’ find job alternative industries, ensure infrastructure appropriate business respond relative price shifts, allow sufficient economic export diversification. this way, heavy reliance specific commodities, market segment value chain become major risk particular sector face global shocks. conclusion in conclusion, let point global environment remain challenge investor policymakers alike, much progress make year good insulate emerge economy unavoidable global shocks, authority additional tool disposal increase resilience medium long term. central bank also play part build-up

require rethinking. a nobel laureatejoseph stiglitz aptly put it, need shift focus happen so-called “average,” take account broad spectrum society. in words, need bring policy close people aim long-term stabilityand inclusive growth.thus, remark today, i wish provide bsp’s perspective tasks. inparticular, i wish discus philippine economy’s recent developments, potential challenges,and bsp’s policy thrust go forward.on solid footingthe good news that, despite challenge operate environment, rely thephilippines’ solid macroeconomic fundamental provide u significant headway towardsa robust inclusive growth.the domestic economy grow 6.2 percent last year. this extend country’s growth streak to80 quarter roughly 20 year uninterrupted growth.it note late figure relatively low compare year ago, weremain track outpace asian peer 2019. the economy growingrobustly 6.0 percent good last 15 quarter since second quarter 2015. admittedly, deal challenge inflation environment last year due supply-sidepressures. the increase international crude oil prices, supply bottlenecks, direct andindirect effect tax reform push inflation beyond government’s target range 2 – 4 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech percent 2018.the bsp’s decisive action raise policy interest rate cumulative 175 basis pointsbeginning may 2018, couple national government’s implementation non-monetarymeasures alleviate price pressures, help rein high inflation ensure would revertback target path.in fact, late figure encourage inflation decline 3.8 percent february year.this within target range 2-4 percent consistent recent forecast marketexpectations manageable inflation environment could sustain near term. while peso experience episode depreciation, note partly dueto strong demand import capital goods, partly build build build program,raw material intermediate product need support grow economy.the country’s external payment position reliably support strong structural foreignexchange inflows. these include remittance overseas filipinos, revenue it-bpoindustry, receipt vibrant tourism sector, sustain inflow foreign directinvestments.with inflows, country’s gross international reserve (gir) stand aroundus$82.90 billion end-february 2019. this roughly equivalent 7.3 months’ worth ofimports good payment service primary income.all could provide sufficient buff external headwinds.a second pillar strengththe sound stable condition bank community, support thrift bankindustry, also serve key pillar strength economy.as end- january 2019, total resource thrift bank (tbs) rise p 1.2

critical role support country’s inclusive economic growth.the three great challenge ahead 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech even i say this, evolve operate environment beset i refer threegreat challenge could potentially derail growth trajectory.first imbalance great divergence global growth. accord internationalmonetary fund (imf), global growth prospect 2019 remain fragile uneven recovery

need continue build strengths.in regard, i fortunate inherit institution legacy excellence, credibility,and independence.rest assured, price financial stability remain bsp’s top priority. on note, canrely bsp remain independent steadfast safeguard primary mandate andimplement timely appropriate policy evidence based.let say word monetary operations. the bsp continue use market-based monetary instrument operations. 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech in particular, bsp work fine-tune monetary operation refinement inour interest rate corridor (irc) framework. the adoption irc framework june 2016,has allow reduction reserve requirement 200 basis point 2018, 20 percentto 18 percent, without sacrifice monetary control.the goal reduce reserve requirement ratio (rrr) therefore resume provide thatdomestic inflation monetary condition would allow it. this commitment gradual reduction deposit reserve low friction cost thebanking sector, create efficient financial intermediation, help curb shadow bankinggiven rise strong alternative offer fintech digital innovation.enhancing policy agilitythis bring second approach. there clearly need make policy moreresponsive change environment.just recently, amendment bsp’s charter enact law. the new charteramendments restore bsp’s authority issue debt papers, provide u great flexibility indetermining time size monetary operations.the bsp also give authority obtain information private individual entity forits policy formulation. the law also widen coverage bsp-supervised financial institutionsto include money service businesses, credit grant business payment systemoperators. these reform put bsp strong position pursue price financialstability mandate amid rapidly evolve environment.in term financial stability, bsp continue foster regulatory environment bothenabling emerge trend effective manage new risks.the bsp’s policy reform agenda aim strengthen risk governance bank set outstandards promote continue enhancement banks’ risk management systems. the bspis guide principle proportionality pursue international best practice itsstrategic policy objectives.for instance, monetary board recently approve extension observation

appropriate regulation response.harnessing bsp multiplierthird last approach something i passionate about. the magnitude andseverity today’s challenge also call bsp go beyond convention embark ongoals outside ambit traditional monetary policy. 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech i talk need support inclusive growth.the bsp’s effective pursuit primary mandate maintain price stability put countryin good position attain inclusive growth. we foster macroeconomic environmentconducive investment supportive job generation employment.however, maximize impact bsp’s policy life filipino entail wetackle

oncentral banking, sintra, 18 june 2019.* * *central bank often establish past aim bring stability aftermathof historic episodes. the bank england establish sovereign debt crisis of1690, government unable obtain fund market. the federal reservewas create series panic rock u bank system late 19th andearly 20th century.the euro introduce 20 year ago response repeat episode exchange-rateinstability need secure single market competitive devaluations. the ecbwas establish keystone new economic monetary union (emu).the first decade monetary union characterise calm macroeconomic conditions,with limit volatility steady economic growth. the second decade, however, seenprofound shift prevail environment – include financial sovereign debt crises– monetary policy strategy adapt it.i would like discus morning evolution come achieve –and past twenty year tell u ecb’s monetary policy future.monetary policy crisisthe ecb’s mandate give treaty price stability. in 1998, govern councildefined price stability inflation within range 0-2% medium term, constitutesthe ecb’s objective. then, 2003, govern council clarify that, within range, wouldaim focal point below, close to, 2%, remain medium-term aim day.this formulation differ standard inflation-targeting framework time,which typically base around point target inflation. but sound reason whythis definition put place.in common central bank across world, ecb face macroeconomic environmentbefore crisis predominantly define low volatility moderate shocks, thedistribution shock inflation almost exclusively upside. in euro area, hicp energyprices rise 80% january 1999 september 2008. under conditions,establishing strong reaction function high inflation see crucial anchorinflation expectations. emphasise aim “below, close to, 2%” see imply astronger commitment standard inflation-targeting regime.but monetary policy euro area also face special challenge. the ecb new centralbank operate heterogeneous monetary union, create particular imperative toestablish inflation credibility. establish commitment control inflation see ascritical cement low inflation expectation across euro area – especially moderateinflation relatively new phenomenon several member states.over two decade 1999, inflation average 3% 10 12 originalmembers. the decline inflation many country run-up emu large part due toexpectations joining, well number extraordinary action take nationalauthorities meet convergence criteria. from 1989–99, long-term inflation expectation hadfallen range 2.5-4.5% four large euro area economy 2%across board. it task new central bank lock moderate-inflation 1 / 8bis central bankers' speech environment – successfully. over next decade, inflation expectationsinternalised ecb’s commitment keep inflation remain 2%.but process build inflation credibility implication ecb’s reactionfunction. a matter accounting, stabilise headline inflation largely cause volatilecomponents must mean core inflation adjust downwards. roll cross-correlationsbetween energy inflation core inflation show episode high energy inflation between1999 2007 accompany period rapidly soften core inflation. a result,between january 1999 september 2008 headline inflation euro area average 2.35%,while core inflation average 1.7% exceed 2% le 15% time.central bank advance economy face similar challenge adopt similarstrategies. but difference mandate – length track record fight inflation – lead todifferences much energy price pass-through headline inflation others comfortableaccommodating. for example, energy price u cpi rise 160% sameperiod headline inflation average 2.9%. the federal reserve react le headlineinflation, core cpi inflation average 2.2%.the upshot euro area enter crisis succeed establish anti-inflation credentials, underlie inflation dynamic perhaps relatively weaker.this immediately apparent, inflation stay fairly elevate level fouryears lehman crash. monetary policy respond decisively global financial crisisand disinflationary threat seem pas quickly.but hindsight seem reasonable conclude inflation process vulnerable toa shift environment – transpire around mid-2012 onwards.new challenge monetary policyat point, headline inflation euro area begin was, retrospect, prolongeddownward drift, core inflation fell almost percentage point mid-2012 early 2014.there two factor help explain switch disinflationary trend.first, distribution shock inflation move strongly downside theamplitude shock increased. supply-side shock gradually dissipate yearsfollowing lehman crash sovereign debt crisis. negative demand shocks, drive atdifferent time domestic demand external demand, instead become dominant sourceof macroeconomic fluctuation euro area. ecb analysis show negative demandshocks weigh euro-area inflation 1 percentage point average sincethe start crisis. in previous ten years, effect neutral overall, period ofboth upward downward pressure.the second factor change macroeconomic policy mix. while first phase ofthe crisis fiscal monetary policy ease tandem – fiscal policy loosen totalof 3% potential gdp 2008 2010 – thereafter stance monetary andfiscal policy decoupled. the euro area fiscal stance turn contractionary response thesovereign debt crisis, tighten around 4 percentage point potential gdp 2013 –years euro area mostly recession.this stand contrast unite states, fiscal policy ease initial phase ofthe crisis, 6.5% potential gdp total 2008–09, tighten about5.5% potential gdp 2011 2013 economic recovery underway. the euroarea force onto different path need country re-establish fiscalcredibility. but aggregate euro area le fiscal space unite states:public debt level similar two jurisdictions. the key difference fiscal12345 2 / 8bis central bankers' speech stabilisation unite state take place federal level, euro area lack acentral fiscal instrument act counter-cyclically.the policy mix also relevant come financial sector policies. after crisis, itwas inevitable bank sector advance economy would deleverage, tocover loss re-focus business models. the unite state ensure processhappened quickly early. around 500 fail bank resolve federal depositinsurance corporation, struggle bank stress-tested recapitalised thetroubled asset relief program. between 2008 2011, u bank improve leverageratio 1.6 percentage point 7.2 8.8%.the response euro area sluggish. despite lever uspeers crisis, euro area bank improve leverage ratio 0.9 percentagepoints, 3.7 4.6%, achieve shed asset le throughraising capital. this part reflect fact that, due fiscal rules, public support bankswas concentrate country fiscal space. moreover, without common resolutionframework around 50 bank resolve euro area period. so weakbanking sector continue drag euro area economy, especially perniciousgiven importance bank lend channel financing.in sum, ecb face environment increase need counterdemand shocks, increase burden monetary policy so. our strategy thereforehad adapt new circumstance order continue deliver aim.monetary policy respond first summer 2012 act defuse sovereign debtcrisis, evolve tail risk inflation material threat price stability.announcing outright monetary transaction (omt) establish commitment counterunwarranted redenomination risk sovereign debt market act powerful circuitbreaker.while omt never activated, effect announcement equivalent large-scale asset purchase programme: spread vulnerable country fell average than400 basis point next two years. the macroeconomic impact omt alsoanalogous purchase programmes: ecb research find gdp price effect ofomt broadly line estimate qe take place unite state andthe unite kingdom.but linger effect sovereign debt crisis dent capacity stimulus tocounter new disinflationary trend. the delay bank deleveraging process euro areabegan accelerate, bank shrink balance sheet pay back centralbank loans. bank balance sheet decline around 20 percentage point gdp 2013 aloneand, end 2013, credit growth private sector contract rate 2.4%relative year earlier. on demand side, risk appetite private sector collapsed, withinvestment subtract 1.6 percentage point gdp

steer theprocess balance sheet repair towards positive macroeconomic outcome. banksstrengthened balance sheet €200 billion advance outcome. that put thebanking sector much strong position transmit policy.but point, euro area economy hit downward shock inflation theform 60% collapse oil price mid-2014, push inflation negative territory.with underlie inflation already weakening, inflation expectation begin affected. a the678910 3 / 8bis central bankers' speech scope interest rate cut limited, become increasingly clear ourreaction function need evolve address new challenges.indeed, since policy framework never systematically test persistentdisinflationary risks, ecb yet chance demonstrate intolerance inflationremaining aim protract period time.at time, appear uncertainty tool would able todeploy effective low bind reached. unlike major economies, ecb hadnot resort large-scale asset purchase global financial crisis aftermath.some even question legality asset purchase europe effectiveness ourbank-based economy.if uncertainty removed, material risk fall inflation couldbecome self-fulfilling: public could begin expect small monetary policy response tofuture inflation undershoots, revise inflation expectation downwards.in words, credibility rely perception ecb’s commitment aim,but also perception capability fight low inflation. we respond situation inthree main ways.the ecb’s policy responsethe first clarify symmetry aim. while quantitative definition pricestability instrumental establish credibility first decade, asymmetric formulationmay lead misperceptions low-inflation environment. thus make clear ourpolicy aim fully symmetric, symmetric around level establishedin 2003: below, close to, 2%. it achieve aim medium term steer ourpolicy decisions.in addition, clarify symmetry mean would accept persistently lowinflation, also cap inflation 2%. a i emphasise number ofoccasions, medium-term orientation imply inflation deviate aim bothdirections, long path inflation converge back towards focal point themedium-term policy horizon.the second part response lay tool would use counteractdownside inflation risks, begin speech i give amsterdam april 2014 thatdescribed three contingency instrument would use react them. thisestablished unambiguously taboo resort unconventionalmeasures. there nothing institutionally legally special euro area thatprohibited monetary policy add accommodation low bind approached.third, various contingency play out, operationalised reaction function bylaunching series new instruments. we break zero bind low ourdeposit rate negative territory, launch target longer-term refinance operations(tltros) provide incentive bank lend, implement large-scale assetpurchase programme (app) public private securities. these measure deliberatelydesigned work package ease stance complementary channels, workingboth bank wide matrix capital markets.the negative rate policy challenge market expectation rate reach zero couldonly go down, help skew distribution rate expectation depress theshort end risk-free curve – key benchmark price bank loans. asset purchasesin tandem compress yield long end curve, push mortgage rate and,111213 4 / 8bis central bankers' speech time, make bank lend firm attractive risk-adjusted terms. and bank-based transmission amplify tltros, low fund cost increasedcompetition

flexibility.having say that, around one-quarter people work part time satisfy hoursthey offer would like work hours: think people underemployed(graph 2). the share part-time worker underemployed move year toyear, current share average level past two decades.graph 2as part abs's monthly survey 50,000 people, ask underemployed worker manyextra hour would like work. on average, answer would like work extra14 hour per week. it interest figure trend past two decades; itused 16 hours. over period, average hour work part-timeworkers increase around 2 hour 17 hour per week. take together, data suggestthat business good job provide hour part-time worker seeking. this shift part-time work mean assess spare capacity need consider measure ofunderemployment well measure unemployment. the rba sometime. a part effort here, construct measure underutilisation takesaccount part-time worker want work hours. this measure add extra hourssought worker hour seek unemployed (graph 3). theseextra hour equivalent around 3.3 per cent labour force, which, take account ofconventional unemployment, mean underutilisation rate 8.1 per cent. this hours-basedmeasure preferable heads-based measure underutilisation treat unemployed personin way part-time worker seek hours.graph 3unlike unemployment rate, trend past 20 years, theunderemployment rate relatively stable. these different pattern unemployment andunderemployment suggest few inroad make spare capacity labourmarket suggest look unemployment rate alone. this something take intoaccount think monetary policy.there is, though, one perspective measure underemployment i would like toshare you. in past, part-time work readily available, many people – mostlywomen – face choice take full-time pay employment pay employment all. many[2] choose to, stay outside labour force work realistic option. fromthe perspective society whole, serious form underutilisation – wasn'tmeasured abs.given trend towards part-time flexible jobs, people option hadbefore many choose join, defer leaving, labour force. from theperspective add productive capacity nation, good outcome therewas measure underutilisation take account exclusion workforce, would surelyhave declined. i want downplay issue underemployment, worth recognisingthis broad perspective, remember come from.flexibility supply sidethis naturally bring second window spare capacity labour market – theflexibility labour supply.over past 2½ years, working-age population increase annual rate around1¾ per cent. over time period, employment increase average rate of2¾ per cent. the fact employment increase considerably fast working-age population lead reduction unemployment rate, reduction large asmight expected. the reason supply labour increase responseto strong demand workers.this flexibility labour supply evident substantial rise labour force participation. theparticipation rate currently stand 66 per cent, high record (graph 4).reflecting this, share working-age population australia job currently aroundthe record high reach peak resource boom. a i discuss moment ago,the availability part-time flexible work arrangement one reason this.[3] graph 4there two group rise participation particularly pronounced: womenand old australian (graph 5). the female participation rate stand 61 per cent, from43 per cent 1979. australia's female participation rate oecd average, although itremains number countries, include canada netherlands.the participation rate old worker also increase recent decade health outcomeshave improve change make retirement policies. the eligibility age thepension progressively raise 60 65 female gradually increase to67 everybody 2023. the preservation age individual access superannuationis also gradually increased. these change contribute high participation olderaustralians. graph 5another source potential labour supply net overseas migration. migration, include temporaryskilled workers, increase sharply resource boom demand skilled labour wasvery strong, subsequently decline (graph 6). while migrant add demand andsupply economy, particularly important source capacity resolve pinch-points skill shortage exist. graph 6a relate source flexibility stem unique relationship new zealand. when labourdemand relatively strong australia, tend increase net inflow workersfrom new zealand australia. when condition relatively subdue here, reverse occurs.during resource boom, inflow across tasman large inflow oftemporary skilled workers.the overall picture one flexible supply side labour market. when demand forlabour strong, people enter job market delay leaving. this rise participation apositive development. but one factor mean strong demand labour hasnot put much upward pressure wages.the match people jobsa third perspective spare capacity labour market gain examine wellpeople look job match job available. look labour marketfrom perspective, thing look little tight suggest two perspective ihave discussed.currently, almost 60 per cent firm report availability labour either minor amajor constraint business (graph 7). this share high resourcesboom, still quite high. report rba's liaison program suggest arecurrently shortage certain type engineers, worker specialise it skill tradespeople associate public infrastructure work. business regional area also morelikely report great degree difficulty find suitable labour.graph 7one contribute factor underinvestment staff training. in shadow globalfinancial crisis many firm cut back train reduce costs. we see evidence ofthe adverse longer-term implication this. a labour market tighten further, i would hope thatmore firm prepare hire worker provide necessary training.another lens job match ratio number unemployed people number jobvacancies (graph 8). at present, few three unemployed people vacancy.this compare 20 people every vacancy early 1990s recession five people forevery vacancy 2014. from perspective labour market look reasonably tight. there alsosome tentative evidence that, average, unemployed worker well match jobvacancies case 2007, ratio two similar level. graph 8one piece evidence unemployment rate come recent years,there little progress reduce long-term unemployment, define areunemployed two year (graph 9). address cause chronicunemployment remain important challenge community. more positively, share thelabour force unemployed one two year trend recenttimes. graph 9another lens job match overall tightness labour market rate jobmobility; is, often people change jobs. here, evidence interesting. despite thefrequent report lack job security regular job switch millennials, average timethat worker stay employer increasing. reflect this, share employedpeople switch employer give year low long time (graph 10).looking data occupation, rate job mobility low manager businessprofessionals high tradespeople worker hospitality industry. graph 10in tight labour market, would expect see either strong wage growth frequent jobchanging business seek workers. but see neither present. one possibleexplanation uncertainty many people feel future. this uncertaintymeans job want keep rather take risk new employer. thismight especially also large mortgage. so possible high level ofhousehold debt also affect labour market dynamics.wagesi turn fourth perspective labour market tightness – wage growth.over past year, wage growth pick labour market tightened. this notsurprising give strength demand labour. but pick-up fairly modest isonly evident private sector (graph 11). over past year, private-sector wage priceindex increase 2.4 per cent, 1.9 per cent previous year. the past two quartershave, however, see low wage increase previous two quarters.in contrast trend private sector, wage growth public sector steady ataround 2½ per cent, largely reflect wage cap across much public sector. it also worth point overall wage growth new south wale victoria beenrunning 2½ per cent despite unemployment rate 4½ per cent low thepast year.graph 11another perspective wage growth national accounts, report average earningsper hour work (graph 12). this measure volatile, late data paint fairly weakpicture, average hourly earn 1 per cent past year. graph 12in summary, overall picture various window labour market despitethe strong employment growth recent times, still considerable spare capacity thelabour market. we remain short unemployment rate associate full employment, issignificant underemployment potential labour force participation increasewhen job there. consistent this, wage growth remain modest therate would ensure inflation comfortably within 2 3 per cent range. the one caveatto assessment difficulty firm find worker necessaryskills. this underline

way working. all symbolise rather inspire yellow lightbulb icon agenda: the second grim stuff: black swans, operational risks, whatever else might lurk ‘hall horrors’ session late – thing response. i’m 100% sure camp speech put in. but i think there’s clue icon you’ve put next name programme – revolutionary clench fist… in one sense i understand i’ve give pugnacious icon. the programme move market libor risk-free rate huge undertaking. it goal vital, simply stated: eliminate profound system-wide vulnerability pose libor. and deadline clear: end-2021. but deliver complex task financial sector face past decade, involve global network market participant public authorities, touch systems, product market way.1 small wonder many firm see libor transition ‘must do’ ‘want do’. but perspective miss key point: libor past sell-by date – risk terms, business term too. it design solve problem different era, market far le transparent, far le adept package repackaging risk. with tool today, post-libor world offer many new good opportunities: meet borrow need household firms; allocate manage risk; express view on, hedge against, future path interest rate credit risk; exploit new technologies. so lightbulb – few clench fists! firm grasp opportunity early real edge. in sterling markets, already see quickly specific instrument switch away libor necessary foundation lay

business – business – grab opportunity present post-libor world meet customer need better, safe ways. in rest remark i want cover three main topics. first, i want summarise business problem libor originally design solve – world change since then. second, i want sketch opportunity post-libor world may bring – thus business, well risk, imperative shift. and, third, i want explain step bank england take de-risk libor-related business. why libor make business sense – what’s change libor’s origin date back syndicate loan market late 1960s. risky borrower develop emerge market look raise

however, see important downside risks. crosscurrent policyuncertainty rise since early may, crimp business investment plans, raise concern insome financial market segments, weigh global growth

basel iii – risk supervision 2019", rome, 25 june2019.* * *euro area banks’ profitability remain weakthe resilience euro area bank sector continue improve past years,supported sustain economic expansion. banks’ aggregate common equity tier 1 ratio, akey measure capital strength, stand 14.3% end 2018, 12.7% mid-2015.cyclical factor also help banks’ profitability recover trough wake thesovereign debt crisis.that said, banks’ return equity (roe), around 6%, still fall short cost capital,which estimate around 8-10% banks. euro area banks’ roe also remain belowthat international peers, instance u nordic banks. recently, profitabilityconcerns come fore operate environment bank become morechallenging, economic growth project slow 2019. banks’ profitability prospectscould thus dampen deteriorate growth expectations, add structural weaknesses.a number bank continue depress market valuations, price-to-book ratio wellbelow one, mirror weak current expect profitability. in words, price-to-bookratios one indicate bank earn correspond cost equity(coe). however, important stress situation individual bank across euroarea vary considerably term roe coe. there still large gap betweenoverperformers underperformers; past year around one-quarter significantbanks deliver roe least 8%, roe worst-performing quartile remainedbelow 3%. the coe situation also mixed: 20% european bank survey theeuropean bank authority estimate coe 10%, around 10% themestimate 8%.why low profitability concern financial stability perspective?so low bank profitability matter financial stability? perhaps importantly,persistently low profitability limit banks’ ability generate capital organically. this make itharder build buff unexpected shock limit capacity fundloan growth. at time, bank weak profitability prospect low market valuationscould find costly, even prohibitively expensive, raise capital market sourcesshould need arise.in addition, bank limit current earn power may also tempt take risk.higher risk-taking bank cause financial imbalance build up, risk becorrelated. in fact, bank sector, profitability (too) high may much aproblem profitability (too) low, may indication excessive risk-taking ofthe sort observe run-up global financial crisis.against background, today i focus remark main determinant banks’profitability outlook. i cover cyclical structural factors, well possible way forbanks return sustainable profitability.cyclical factor help improve bank profitability recent yearsbank performance closely link economic activity. in fact, bank profitability improve in1 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech past year back continue economic growth, euro area banks’ roereaching 6% 2018, 3% two year earlier. cyclical factor support theseprofitability improvement via three channels. first, broaden economic expansion, coupledwith low interest rates, make easy borrower repay loans, lead bettercredit quality low bank provisions. second, increase lend volume help offsetthe negative impact shrink net interest margins. and third, favourable macroeconomicenvironment also support npl work-outs reduction risk premia, lead tohigher npl sales, contribute low provision needs.in context, important recall overall effect monetary policy bankprofitability far broadly neutral. nevertheless, overall effect negative rate onthe bank sector need carefully monitored, particularly balance theireffects depend long rate remain negative territory.progress tackle structural challenge clearly insufficientnotwithstanding weaken economic prospects, banks’ profitability mainly weigh downby structural factors. improve cost efficiency one key challenges. cost efficiency, asmeasured cost-to-asset cost-to-income ratios, deteriorate since 2010 costcontainment offset mark decline revenue total assets. a result, euro areabanks continue underperform international peer term cost efficiency withan average cost-to-income ratio 66%, compare 55–57% nordic u banks. it isimportant keep mind, however, picture extremely vary level individualbanks, best-performing bank euro area show evidence sustainedprofitability improvement support efficiency gains.second, despite notable progress reduce legacy npl stocks, bank continue faceearnings headwind due low return npls, tie capital, absorb operationalcapacity incur legal administrative costs.third, excess capacity offer explanation euro area bank sector’s lowprofitability, reduce cost efficiency erode banks’ price power. and base acomposite indicator overcapacity construct use various measure size, competitionand efficiency, euro area bank indeed score relatively poorly compare advancedeconomies.finally, market fund condition remain favourable, need issue bond areeligible minimum requirement fund eligible liabilities, mrel, may posechallenges bank come years, especially small bank lowercredit ratings. a possible increase fund cost might complicate effort build thenecessary loss-absorption capacity could weigh profitability.possible way bank return sustainable profitabilitylet turn discuss possible solution profitability problem. first, no“one-size-fits-all” strategy bank return sustainable profitability. each bank’s preferredstrategy likely depend multiple factors.let’s start reduce cost improve efficiency. these necessary steps, andpotential strategy achieve range traditional measures, downsizingand branch closures, adopt new, cost-saving technology aim digitalise financialintermediation services, example increase reliance internet-based banking.it must remembered, however, benefit typically accrue gradually. reducingovercapacity entail restructure cost short run, benefit materialise later. andfor digitalisation, typically significant short-run cost involve severance payment and234 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech it investment, potential profitability gain may accrue medium longterm.digitalisation important permanent cost-saving strategy banks, particularly incountries dense branch network. but need underpin certain structuralrequirements. banks’ ability cut cost depend factor labour laws, populationdensity overall level digitalisation society. the scandinavian (and benelux) countriesprovide example successful cost optimisation strategy digitalisation.in addition cut costs, many bank also need improve income-generatingcapacities. one possible avenue good income diversification enhance fee andcommission-based activities. however, extent bank diversify areasgenerating fee commission income likely depend specific businessmodels. in particular, bank rely heavily maturity transformation business generateincome could benefit increase amount total income account byfee commission-based activities.consolidation bolster efficiency cost-cutting synergies. evidence suggeststhat domestic merger acquisition (m&as) tend focus achieve cost synergies, whilecross-border m&as appear drive expansion opportunities. this mainlybecause bank great scope streamline overlap distribution network within theirdomestic market.so domestic consolidation crucial. domestic m&as deliver substantial cost savings,particularly le concentrate bank markets. this achieve economy ofscale, example, low administrative expense branch rationalisation, throughrevenue synergies, low fund cost merge unit.however, consolidation across country indispensable complement domestic m&as.banks geographically diversify tend display strong revenueperformance recent years. furthermore, cross-border hold deposit loan canhelp bolster economic resilience within euro area help smooth shock throughincome-sharing. these private sector risk-sharing channel play important role smoothingshocks unite state much small magnitude euro area.there still significant obstacle prevent u reap full benefit cross-border consolidation. in order facilitate large m&as within euro area bank sector, wemust make progress towards complete bank union capital marketsunion, overcome prevail regulatory supervisory obstacles. truly pan-european banksneed conduct liquidity capital management consolidate level efficient.concrete step direction involve establish european deposit insurance scheme and,subsequently, remove national option discretions, example regard capital andliquidity, well harmonise insolvency law taxation regimes. discrepancy ininsolvency judicial system hamper cross-border activity capital markets. a consistentand efficient framework pursue fail contract vital reduce uncertainty cross-border investors.concluding remarkslet conclude.the persistently weak profitability euro area bank sector remain key concern forfinancial stability, constrain banks’ ability build buff negative shocks. whilecyclical factor help improve bank profitability last years, progress tacklingstructural challenge clearly insufficient.567 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech reduce cost

director bank international settlements, 5th annualmacroprudential conference, eltville, 21 june 2016.* * *1 introductionladies gentlemen,every contact leaf trace. that basic principle forensic science. in early decade ofthe 20th century, establish pioneer french criminologist edmond locard, andthus become know locard’s exchange principle. but locard’s approach may havebeen affect exchange – develop method come contact withdetective fiction.years locard set forensic laboratory 1910, fictional character declare apopular story: “as long criminal remain upon two leg long must someindentation, abrasion, trifle displacement detect scientificresearcher.” you know fictional investigator – none sherlock holmes.when arthur conan doyle publish first story consult detective victoriantimes, criminal investigation usually start testimony motives. physicalevidence seek theory built. and detective still lack renouncingfundamental forensic tools. it 1901 british police adopt fingerprinting, forexample.sherlock holmes’ method deduction, reach conclusion base observe facts, helpedhim unravel mystery virtually comfort armchair. but master detective alsohad go crime scene search tiny trace magnify glass collect datahe needed.the analysis risk financial stability resemble piece together strand evidence acriminal case. indeed, richard barwell, head macro research bnp paribas assetmanagement, refer principle evidence-based macroprudential policy the“sherlock holmes approach”.2 macroprudential policy measure germanytake germany’s intention activate countercyclical capital buffer, instance. on 27 may,germany’s financial stability committee issue recommendation activate countercyclicalcapital buff 0.25%. the step base thorough detective work bundesbank. inlast year’s financial stability review present evidence point cyclical systemic riskswhich build years. view entirety, risk imply precautionaryaction required, prompt committee issue recommendation.let’s take close look evidence available.2.1 the case macroprudential policy actionexhibit a, speak, case macroprudential action danger marketparticipants may underestimate future credit risk whilst overestimate loss-absorbing capacity.123 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech in wake prolong economic expansion, many market participant may long takesufficient account period crisis downturn risk assessments. and since riskprovisioning low level now, possible future loss could eat directly equity buffersof banks.besides, analysis bundesbank well imf suggest credit grantedincreasingly enterprise comparatively weak financially. in event anunexpected economic downturn, solvency firm could come pressure thelevel non-performing loan may rise fast past. exhibit b case macroprudential action development house market. thegerman residential property market take since 2010. within last nine years, houseprices rise nationwide almost 60%. while average increase explain byfundamental factors, real estate price german city last year 15% 30%above fundamental would suggest, accord bundesbank estimates. and indicatorslike price-to-rent ratio paint similar picture overvaluation urban areas.in general, residential property market nourish major financial imbalances. after all, the46 systemic bank crisis various country house price data available, morethan two-thirds follow boom-bust pattern house prices.now, weigh potential economic fallout conceivable price correction thehousing market, size overvaluation adjustment matters. howthe boom fund also crucial importance. sharp decline asset price beparticularly harmful economy impact propagate amplify thefinancial system. if overvaluation asset drive rapidly expand credit, downturnthe deteriorate balance sheet borrower lender constrict new lending. this, turn,curtails investment worsen economic contraction. in 1980s, rise bank credit also fuel surge land price major city japan. thisreal estate bubble often deem origin japanese financial crisis the1990s, period time give rise term “lost decade” due economicstagnation brought. mitsuhiro fukao elaborate japanese experience fewminutes. in germany, however, credit main driver rise house price recent years.even though growth rate house loan accelerate 4.6% year-on-year end of2018, overall growth moderate, cumulate 26% within last nine years. and itslast financial stability review, bundesbank come conclusion credit standard hadnot relax considerably. thus, overall, available evidence point tosubstantially heighten financial stability risk new lend housing.still, potentially overvalue property mean potentially overvalue collateral. this say that, inan adverse scenario, household income house price take hit simultaneously,the share non-performing loan could rise, value collateral could drop. incombination, would cause bank loss increase markedly, house lend make up45% total bank loan private household enterprises.exhibit c case macroprudential action heighten interest rate risk, whichmortgages good example. at present, 47% newly issue mortgage interestrate lock-in period ten years, compare 26% 2010. if interest rate toquickly spike higher, would instantly drive cost fund banks. but interestincome would increase time lag. and many institution would affectedsimultaneously, bank could cushion impact step new lend business.4567891011 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech the opposite scenario, protract continuation low interest rates, would bode wellfor banks’ earn capacity, either. in particular, would increasingly burden bank whichrely traditional retail deposit-taking lend operation main source income.so, bank find sort diver’s dilemma. stay underwater long entailsthe risk run oxygen. but come quickly may cause decompression sickness.hence, bank need resilient interest rate scenarios: rate stay low longerthan expected, rate spike higher.just many criminal case solve piece together small shred evidence, thegerman financial stability committee ass cumulative weight cluesthey gathered. and clue point common suspect: possible underestimationof risk increase vulnerability financial system. the preponderance evidencesuggests

vital.activation bear important consequence banks. therefore, measure must takenwith legal certainty. thorough investigation necessary mean observe financialsystem long period time. all available evidence need gather andcarefully assessed. it cumulative weight substantial warrant action. this therecommendation come point time, earlier.some observer may wonder whether window action already closed, give thegerman economy cool markedly since middle last year. accord tobundesbank macroeconomic projection publish two week ago, economic activity likely togrow 0.6% year. but expert consider soft patch largely due toa slowdown external demand, weigh export-oriented sectors. indeed, manufacture hasentered downturn.by contrast, sector great domestic focus continue grow robustly, support byfavourable finance conditions, loosen fiscal policy labour market still excellentshape. a long dichotomy within german economy persists, underlie cyclicaltrend likely remain weak.going forward, economic expert thus anticipate soft patch last little longer. butgiven export regain traction, economic activity pick second half year.as result, economy expect grow pace 1.2% next year 1.3% 2021. inthis baseline scenario, utilisation aggregate capacity likely remain level distinctlyabove normal. thus, macroeconomic condition still benign, cyclical risk beenidentified financial system. so appropriate time bank sector takepreventive action build resilience. 3 / 7bis central bankers' speech for least two researcher room, recommendation activate thecountercyclical capital buff may come

macroprudential reaction financial stability risk also meansto protect monetary policy.but macroprudential policy impact monetary policy: monetary policy influencesfinancial stability thus macroprudential policy well. a keynote speaker jean tirolehas point before, monetary policy affect risk appetite market participants. inline risk-taking channel monetary policy, bundesbank economist

bundesbank also monitoringthe possible emergence new risk financial stability might echo past.technological progress rapidly transform way live. this especially true forpayment systems. “stablecoins”, known, crypto-tokens account whose valueis peg exist fiat currency – basket currencies. be stable store value isan important precondition use crypto-tokens account everyday transactions.the allure stablecoins lie potential use digital peer-to-peer transactions, without thevolatility value usually observe crypto-tokens. but also create risk forconsumers. in particular, question value stablecoins

bank ofchina, tsinghua pbcsf global finance forum, beijing, 25 may 2019.* * *distinguished guests, professors, student friends,good morning!it give great pleasure attend tsinghua pbcsf global finance forum. take thisopportunity, i would like share observation economic financialissues common interest. i would also welcome question comment late on.i. the escalation trade friction unite state help solve problem.on may 10th, u government announce increase tariff $200 billion chineseexports. it declare impose ban huawei chinese companies, andalso decide launch anti-subsidy investigation renminbi exchange rate. such actionsdid surprise chinese government, company people, believe atrade war help solve problem, could harm others notbenefiting inflictor, result collateral damage whole.from perspective china, though theory u could raise tariff chinese exportsto maximum, impact china’s economy would limited. firstly, vast majorityof china’s export u suitable domestic sale. now china right process ofconsumption upgrade, mean rapidly expand domestic market could absorb largeamount product intend export, without exert “crowding out” effect theexisting consumer goods. secondly, export market diversified. with greatprogress make belt road initiative, chinese product also welcome overseasmarkets us. thirdly, despite tariff increase, substantial amount thechinese product still expect export us, one hand, currently nobetter substitute products, other, u importer will toshare increase cost give ample profit import business. fourthly, china nowupgrading industrial structure, require transfer certain production activity tooverseas, thus facilitate high-quality growth china. fifthly, financial market chinawithstood over-impacts cause trade tension last year. hence, become moreresilient stand shocks.from perspective us, would expose correspond backlash tariff increaseto almost extent. for example, u export china contract, wouldundermine interest many u company lead notable income decline ushigh-tech firms. a large number u company long accustom relyingon processing, assembly, transportation distribution chinese export creatingvalue add severely impacted, even face danger go bust. the usconsumers would also pay high costs, low- middle-income people, farmer andblue-collar worker particular, suffer welfare loss real terms. besides, ushas huge asset liability overseas, rely wall-street dominate internationalfinancial system country. a trade war undoubtedly lead marketfluctuations ultimately lackluster international financial market.from logic perspective, u tariff increase aim reduce trade deficit china. butwith china’s retaliatory measures, forthright outcome tariff increase could quite murkyand even counter-productive end factor considered. firstly, put china’s high-tech firm sanction list, u government explicitly forbid sale product 1 / 9bis central bankers' speech technology companies, action directly increase trade deficit usitself. secondly, launch trade war send wave international financialmarket, lead rapid depreciation renmibi, arouse u governmentconcern compromise effect tariff increase. thirdly, substantial tariff increase wouldinflate commodity prices, dent advantage low inflationary environment enjoy theus economy. fourthly, gap leave curb chinese import would fill export fromother economies, result unchanged total u trade deficit.from perspective history, trade friction u rise economieshave last 40 years, first germany, japan, late fourasian dragons. in 2000, china overtake japan country record big trade surpluswith us. now, country india, vietnam, indonesia, philippines, bangladesh andsome latin american country develop strong momentum, jointlypromoting change international pattern trade good services. hence, china’sexports u may decrease gradually, overall pattern u trade deficit hardto change.ii. the unite state benefit substantially trade deficit china.if look statistics, seem u lose side give large valueand percentage trade deficit china. but granular analysis, difficult tosee u actually get huge benefit trade china many aspects. to use ametaphor here, u gain benefit bilateral economic trade exchange chinaare like peel several layer skin bull.first，the u importer multinationals grab lion share add value thetrade balance. nearly 60 percent us-china trade deficit good attribute foreign-invested company china, us-owned companies. thus, sale theseproducts ultimately contribute revenue profit u companies. 61 percent thetrade imbalance china u come process trade, china get verylittle actual value distribution. besides, one-third growth u companies’ overseassales contribute chinese market.second, u consumer enjoy huge “consumer surplus” trade china.according statistics, one-fourth retail good u market import fromchina. for example, 26 percent product sell wal-mart come directly china. thesteady flow china’s inexpensive quality product u help low cost ofliving u household improve welfare.third, china support price u export product services. for example,if without china’s large purchase commodity grain energy, well civilianaircrafts chips, price would mean today’s level. besides, accord usstatistics, surplus $40 billion trade service china every year.fourth, u experience miracle “high consumption low inflation” since the1990s. even ten year quantitative easing, distinct inflation us.one significant reason china, population large europe, usand japan combined, mature stage industrialization, unprecedentedlyincreased global supply consumer goods.fifth, u gain huge volume cheap capital repatriation. the capitalaccumulated china trade surplus underpin u consumption investment inthe form china invest u dollar-denominated asset u treasury bonds.by end last year, china hold total $7.3 trillion worth international financial assets,more half denominate u dollar. with continue inflow chinesecapital, fund cost u market remain extremely low, create extremely 2 / 9bis central bankers' speech favorable condition u economic recovery prosperity.sixth, u long occupy china’s huge save resources. the chinese people arehardworking frugal. even monthly salary around dozen dozen ofdollars, try put aside money savings. hence, china’s domestic save rateand household save rate always relatively high level. while contrary, theus relatively large investment-to-savings gap. by token, u huge currentaccount deficit china mean u occupation china’s net save scale.since capital repatriate china u mainly take form security otherassets investment, couple high share direct finance u financial system,deposit creation u remain low. over past several decades, broad moneysupply cash u grow slowly, sharp contrast phenomenonof 1970s 1980s, suffice explain new secret us, is, even save lotsof money print issue dollar notes. in sense, famous triffin dilemma inthe international economics study find effective solution.iii. the allege “china’s theft u technology” logic power politics.forty year ago, china start introduce foreign investors, allow set threedifferent kind foreign-invested enterprise (i.e. sino-foreign joint ventures, sino-foreigncooperative enterprise wholly foreign-owned enterprises), since gain hugeprofits china. now market sale foreign investor china amount trillion ofdollars profit reach hundred billion dollars. all base theprinciple reciprocal cooperation mutual benefits, without one investmentcontracts force sign chinese government. strict observance contract hasalways advocate europe unite states, gradually appreciate thechinese enterprise residents. but sudden, u allege chinese lawsand economic practice impose “forced technology transfer”, “forced ipr transfer” evenused word “theft”. that challenge basic facts, also humiliation tothe chinese people.it common practice rise economy learn knowledge experience ofdeveloped countries. that emerge so-called “catching imitation”concept development economics. over ten century history, china’s scienceand technology second none world. our intangible asset make exceptionalcontributions development human civilization. the well-known “four great inventions” ofancient china contribute emergence capitalism europe. without gunpowder,compass, print technology, would modern industrial economy. great menin history francis bacon karl marx speak highly that. that said, itseems retrospect ancestor regrets. though invent somany things, fail invent “ipr”.looking back history, note imitation even plagiarism technologyamong country common industrial age europe us. somecompanies even try acquire advance technology dishonest unprincipledmeans. this specific historical time phase bypassed. the developedcountries go process standardize intellectual property protection. butit build upon work predecessor country achieve newbreakthroughs make new contribution technological advancement. thus, believethat country, include us, realize modernization theft. but rather, modernizationcan achieve hard work strenuous effort peoples.it originate western country trade technology market trade market fortechnology. base principle fairness, technology trade fundamental marketeconomy activity commonly accepted. over past years, develop countries, include 3 / 9bis central bankers' speech european country us, always claim voluntarily transfer knowledge andtechnology principle free fair trade, help third world country get rid ofpoverty backwardness realize economic independence. if goal achieved, itwill undoubtedly conducive development world economy. but seem thatus willingness fulfill commitments.by technology transfer, develop country continuously gain substantial returns.through mean patent grant franchising, develop country make hugeprofits technology apply develop economies. some profit inturn re-invested research development (r&d), form “perfect cycle” thetechnological advancement develop countries. besides, many technology weretested application develop countries. with contribution project managersin country improve technologies, overall technological capacity thedeveloped country promoted.it totally groundless u make accusation china cite intellectualproperty protection cover aim essence trade protectionism. in contemporaryworld, china already firm defender active builder international intellectual propertyrules. the director general world intellectual property organization (wipo), francisgurry, say interview china intellectual property news 2019 sideline thehigh-level forum china ip protection “china world lead player intellectualproperty creation protection”. only year ago u government, agencies, andpoliticians openly acknowledge china’s progress intellectual property protection. be allchanged overnight?the history proven, continue prove that, sanction blockade stop acountry’s technological economic development, contrary make furtherdetermined continue research push forward technological development. duringthe 1950s 1960s, despite blockade embargo impose us, china stilldeveloped atomic hydrogen bombs, missile man-made satellite poor,backward tough situations, gradually make one lead science andtechnological power world.iv. china deepen reform renminbi exchange rate regime.china’s cpc central committee state council decide deepen reform onrenminbi exchange rate formation mechanism, increase flexibility renminbi exchange rateand keep largely stable reasonable equilibrium level. over recent years, renminbiexchange rate basket currency keep stable global context. the chinesegovernment make great effort maintain balance flexibility stability ofrenminbi exchange rate, widely recognize international community.since early 1990s, u constantly threaten china allegation “exchangerate manipulation”. by definition u treasury department, three quantitative criterion needto fulfil concurrently become currency manipulator, including: 1) annual tradesurplus $20 billion us, 2) current account surplus account 3 percent ofgdp, 3) value foreign exchange purchase exchange rate interference purposeexceeding 2 percent gdp. in 2018, china’s current account surplus 0.37 percent ofits gdp, large amount foreign exchange purchase, neither china gaincompetitive advantage trade currency depreciation. so u government hardlylabel china currency manipulator.over past decade, dramatic renminbi depreciation trigger external factors.the recent one may year, offshore chinese yuan drop 3 percentagainst dollar, totally cause escalate trade friction u government. overthe years, develop country always call great flexibility renminbi exchange rate. 4 / 9bis central bankers' speech however, renminbi exchange rate formation mechanism become market-orientedand elastic, country soon adopt attitude “lord ye’s love dragons”, theactual fear behind profess love, unfounded suspicion accusation towards china,which absolutely ridiculous.as well-known, despite recent fx market fluctuations, far panic amongchinese firm residents. more people realize realistic makemoney currency speculations. nor safe transfer financial asset overseas. insophisticated markets, nearly company individual live investment return foreigncurrency speculation. even so-called mr watanabe japan actually turn anoverstated investment story.it normal temporary fluctuation renminbi exchange rate. but long run, givenchina’s economic fundamentals, continue renminbi depreciation unlikely. with huge marketsize growth potential, china remain big engine global economic growth. asthe quality china’s economic development improves, renminbi exchange rate keepapproaching purchase power parity (ppp), speculator try short sell thechinese currency inevitably suffer huge losses. v. china practice so-called state capitalism.in recent years, view world rapid development china’seconomy result practice “state capitalism”, explain chinese productsare extremely competitive international market. that groundless reasoning.in fact, china’s economic structure become increasingly diversified, market share ofstate-owned enterprise continue decline. factor public service government,china’s state-owned economy account le 40 percent gdp. many state-owned enterprise get list china abroad, thus become company withmixed ownership nature. enterprise 100 percent state-owned limited. for largestate-owned enterprises, number subsidiaries’ ultimate control transfer toprivate companies. even among central government-owned enterprises, compete witheach other. more 20 year ago reform military industrial enterprises, eachsector divide two companies.at present, private foreign capital enter almost industry sectors, withfew face legal policy restrictions. be rail transportation, equipment manufacturing, rawenergy materials, enterprise different kind ownership structure find thesesectors. china adopt principle neutral competition, emphasize market playersare treat equally. we encourage compete cooperate, complementeach win-win relationship. china’s industrial credit policy guide nature.when implement policies, principle market law must observed. suchpolicies difference u national export initiative european industrialrenaissance. internationally, always people complain chinese governmentprovides huge subsidy products. in fact, kind criticism logically difficult stand.if enterprise subsidized, resource must equally take them.the financial industry also cultivate diversify structure. china state-owned financialinstitutions, well foreign-owned ones. list institution rural credit cooperative evenhave natural person shareholders. there 3,000 private-controlled institution of4,588 bank institution china, 170 chinese insurance company areprivate-controlled. most security company fund company private-owned aswell. even top five commercial banks, foreign ownership account high 25percent decade ago, time difficult even apply branch inthe us. currently, big banks’ ownership share private sector, domestic foreign,account average 30 percent, even exceed 40 percent. it shall also 5 / 9bis central bankers' speech point although kpis top five bank improving, market sharecontinue decline, 37 percent. so term market concentration, china notablylower major economies, like u european countries.another typical example china’s fintech, take lead world. the mostimportant underlie reason government adopt prudent yet inclusive attitudetowards private internet companies, thus create fair competition environment. large state-owned bank adopt attitude competition cooperation beginningtoward fintech companies. for example, decade ago, ali-pay bear swiftlygrew cooperation large medium-sized banks, include china constructionbank. now, fintech company establish strategic cooperative partnership thelarge medium-sized banks. other bank also make great effort developfintech business. they carry all-round cooperation it company fund raising,account opening, payment settlement, inclusive finance etc. they draw other’sstrengths make other’s shortcomings, achieve remarkable results.thus, demonstrate even significant essential field, chinesegovernment didn’t simply exercise state monopoly.vi. the goal improve corporate governance structure remain unchanged.in recent years, foreign institution organization skeptical china’scorporate governance, especially cpc’s role it. private enterprise china havealways operate independently effectively base article association andgovernance structures. they independent entity operate market abide therules market. the cpc interfere operation.in state-owned enterprises, leadership cpc always play central role. it isthe distinctive feature chinese corporate governance model integrate theleadership cpc. president xi jinping stress major political principle toadhere cpc’s leadership state-owned enterprises, must implementedconsistently; reform state-owned enterprise follow direction ofestablishing modern enterprise system, must also implement consistently. tofurther deepen reform state-owned enterprises, corporate governance must improvedwhile role cpc must also fully recognized, two integrate andbetter promote other.from perspective global theoretical research empirical studies, neither aunified model corporate governance “optimal model” blindly copied. thefundamental corporate governance principle framework chinese enterprise linewith international prevail standards. at g20 hangzhou summit hold china 2016,we make clear communiqué support principle corporate governanceadvocated g20 oecd. under general principle framework, complieswith international common practice make adjustment refinement practiceto reflect country’s specific conditions.establishing modern enterprise system uphold cpc’s leadership fullycompatible other. first, term establish mechanism effectivechecks balance place, general meet shareholders, board directors,the senior management board supervisor encourage assume respectiveresponsibilities role accordance law. the cpc committee mainly take theresponsibility lead direction, manage overall situation ensure implementation.it play key role ensure company abide law policy, cultivate healthycorporate culture fulfill social responsibilities. business strategy decision-making areup board directors. second, protection stakeholders, good corporategovernance mean take full account legitimate right interest shareholders, 6 / 9bis central bankers' speech employees, customers, communities, creditors, well upstream downstreamcompanies supply chain. cpc always adhere fundamental principle servingthe people. it rich experience mass work capacity organize motivate,which good protect legitimate right interest parties. third, cpcorganizations adopt collective leadership, member cpc committee, board ofdirectors, board supervisor also cross-appointed, good solveproblems like internal controls, large shareholder manipulation, inadequate performance ofdirectors, non-independence independent directors, on.past practice prove cultivate corporate governance model chinesecharacteristics absolutely feasible. for example, core lead role cpc committeehave fully bring play five large banks, i.e. icbc, abc, boc, ccb bocm.these bank make historic breakthrough corporate governance businessperformance series major initiative reform ownership structure,introduction strategic investors, get list domestically overseas. some thebanks international award corporate governance decade ago. thesebanks also highly internationalize global network shareholder outlets.some key business indicator bank reach international advance level,including productivity, return capital, cost-to-income ratio, capital adequacy ratio andprovisioning coverage ratio, name few. it also show learn theinternational experiences, china capable proactively explore good corporate governancemodels chinese characteristics.vii. china unswervingly keep open financial sector.the opening-up financial sector trend times, neither stop gobackward. in 2013, china overtake u become

many u think value canadian dollar areabout travel, bank canada, view important price face oureconomy directly affect much produce, consume trade.that’s right place explore critical role flexible exchange rate play incanada’s economy. and time right well. canada enter 50 consecutiveyear float currency, long country, date last unpeggedfrom greenback may 1970.this second speech public engagement campaign call “toward 2021.” we call itthat 2021 next renewal date five-year inflation-control agreement thegovernment canada, first adopt 1991. for renewal, we’ve commit wide-ranging review monetary policy framework ensure best achieve mandate goal ofprice stability thereby promote strong sustainable output employment growth forthe benefit canadians. the framework two components: 2 per cent inflation targetand flexible exchange rate.the inflation target normally get attention, value float dollar risksbeing overlook time performance flexible exchange rate come undergreater scrutiny international policy circles.my purpose today review evidence make case canada many otheropen economy well-served market-determined flexible exchange rate. inparticular, canada’s experience inflation target underpin float currency aninstructive example durable monetary policy framework post-war period. theflexible exchange rate help economy adjust external shocks, primarily change incommodity prices. although float currency completely offset impact ofthese shocks, complement bank’s inflation target help achieve low stableinflation keep economy function well.while we’re go alter flexible exchange rate component monetary policyframework, incumbent policy-makers review even successful regime regularly toensure serve best interest canadians. to end, it’s worthwhile toexplore four main benefit float dollar:it allow monetary policy independence achieve domestic price stability.it facilitate adjustment external shocks, thereby buff impact economicactivity.it contribute policy clarity effectiveness.it promote financial sector development.we also examine recent criticism flexible exchange rates. because exchange rate aremarket price trade daily, intrinsically volatile. this volatility increase cost ofth1 1 / 11bis central bankers' speech make international transaction pose risk managed, especially byexporters importers. nonetheless, come squarely side benefit aflexible exchange rate canada far exceed costs.the canadian casecanada export wide range commodities, represent 45 per cent exports(chart 1 chart 2). consequently, prices, whether oil, gold wheat, criticallyimportant, success canadian exporter canadian economy morebroadly. their prices, however, largely determine global market force demandand supply. most canada’s key commodity export also price u dollars—a point i willcome back later.canada’s flexible exchange rate also determine market forces, though bank canadaclearly influence policy interest rate. when raise interest rates, orraise expectation high interest rates, loonie tend appreciate othercurrencies—and vice versa. in way, dollar important channel transmission ofmonetary policy.we typically measure value canadian dollar relative u dollar, since usdollar widely use valuation commodity currencies. that’s becauseof dominant place global economy widespread use global reserve currency.but, important currency’s value exports, import overall economy, thebank canada specific target dollar. the flexible exchange rate worksbest determine market condition within credible policy framework.consequently, haven’t intervene currency market behalf 20years.our analysis exchange rate fluctuation indicate major movement dollar arelargely drive market force theory would predict, namely movement commodityprices interest rate differentials. fortunately, deep liquid financial market havedeveloped help canadian trade firm manage low cost risk associate suchvolatility.price stability, fix exchange rate, main monetary policy objective. maintain lowand stable inflation around 2 per cent provide credible nominal anchor. well-anchored inflationexpectations allow monetary policy flexible exchange rate respond external shocksand help shelter canadian economy workforce excess fluctuations.to illustrate flexible exchange rate fit inflation target within monetary policyframework, consider figure 1. our monetary policy framework two pillars: inflation targetand flexible exchange rate.figure 2 illustrate framework action. the policy interest rate control bank ofcanada primarily influence outlook economic activity inflation. in contrast,the exchange rate determine global market forces, real financial, encompassthe global demand supply canadian good service well assets. because ourflexible exchange rate respond help absorb external forces, allow u targetinflation policy rate.our success, similar country also target inflation, speak itself. our inflationtarget 2 per cent within 1 3 per cent range jointly review renew thebank government five time since 1995.while value loonie range value low 60 cent u parity with234 2 / 11bis central bankers' speech u dollar quarter century, inflation remain within 1 3 per cent rangeroughly 80 85 per cent time, overall average 1.9 per cent. thatprice stability come despite financial crisis 1990s emerging-market economies, thestrong expansion turn millennium, global financial crisis, great recessionand subsequent slow recovery—all generate large fluctuation commodityprices.our monetary policy framework support several critical advantage nationthat enhance credibility effectiveness. they include sustainable fiscal policy, thecanadian government follow since mid-1990s. such policy leaf space tostimulate economy event economic downturn, countercyclical fiscalmeasures, regional transfers. it also include flexible labour market high degreeof internal economic integration capital mobility well resilient financial system, whichi’ll circle back later.given context, let’s turn four benefit flexible exchange rate.steering coursethrough history, canada rely foreign trade investment economicprosperity. but economic openness leaf canadian vulnerable event rest theworld. like freighter ship, benefit trade, canada expose wind globaleconomic storms. the best strategy minimize vulnerability keep ship goodorder, include monetary policy aim achieve price stability.how flexible exchange rate give u leeway set course monetary policyand inflation? to illustrate, it’s worth go back september 1950, canada firstabandoned post-war bretton wood peg exchange rate. the decision widelycriticized—it see radical move canada one originalsignatories post-war system. the passage time prove trail-blazing policyshift. it demonstrate value flexible exchange rate, likely spar canadian several yearsof double-digit inflation.at time, u economy grow strongly, fuel military spend koreanwar. because increase u demand, inflationary pressure build commodityprices rising. in canada, foreign exchange rate reserve accumulate thepegged exchange rate. rather continue allow u inflationary pressure spill tocanada, authority allow exchange rate float—in words, determine bymarket forces. the canadian dollar rapidly appreciated, help stem inflationary pressure.it’s insightful compare experience mexico’s period. in contrast tocanada, mexico maintain peg peso u dollar. we see happen bylooking chart 3a. canada’s flexible exchange rate absorb inflationary spillover, wehad much low rate inflation.canada return peg rate period 1962 1970 leave bretton woodssystem good 1970. the circumstance similar 1950. replace koreanwar vietnam war, story tell canada mexico, i won’trepeat it, except draw attention chart 3b.similar lesson draw compare canada latin american country from1970 mid-1990s. it relatively unstable period, economically politically, yetmany latin american country try maintain peg exchange rate u dollar.consequently, experience frequent exchange rate crisis peg become untenableand collapsed.5678 3 / 11bis central bankers' speech with peg rates, monetary policy largely drive u monetary policy, whichoften prove inappropriate domestic circumstances. in contrast, canada’s float currencyallowed policy deviate u monetary policy needed, contribute ourbetter economic performance.as mentioned, canada adopt current monetary policy framework inflation target andflexible exchange rate 1991. right outset, successful low inflation andmaking stable. this experience share early adopter inflationtargeting, include new zealand (1990) sweden (1995). with success evident, othercountries close tie unite state follow suit: brazil (1999), chile (1999), colombia(1999), mexico (2001) peru (2002), adoption—along broad reforms—alsoled much low stable rate inflation.in summary, canada many countries, almost 40 total, able tosuccessfully chart independent course monetary policy exert domestic control overinflation leeway provide flexible exchange rate.and yet event lead global financial crisis aftermath lead someobservers question value flexible exchange rate insulate domestic economyagainst external financial force provide sufficient monetary independence. accord tothese observers, domestic financial condition largely determine global forces,irrespective exchange rate regime, thereby render domestic monetary policy ineffective.consequently, increase monetary policy control, recommend use capital controls,particularly emerging-market economies. impose capital controls, however, would distortincentives likely hind financial sector development, necessary effectivetransmission domestic monetary policy.the theoretical backdrop think know impossible trinity, mundell’strilemma. simply put, mean country want monetary policy independence freecapital movement cannot also fix exchange rate. it two threethings. in words, flexible exchange rate necessary achieve monetaryindependence influence domestic monetary conditions.rey (2013) recently argue trilemma long appropriate globalfinancial cycle drive capital flows, flow primarily determine domestic financialconditions, domestic monetary policy. therefore, policy-makers face dilemma(between free capital movement independent monetary policy), country would needcapital control conduct independent monetary policy.however, shambaugh (2004) obstfeld, ostry qureshi (2019) show exchange rateregimes matter, even emerging-market economies, come transmission ofglobal financial shocks. both study find flexible exchange rate provide great monetaryindependence consistent trilemma.more fundamentally, world open capital markets, mundell framework would imply that,while impact interest rate monetary policy action may muted, thetransmission monetary policy take place exchange rate. simply put, flexibleexchange rate still preserve degree monetary policy independence.in summary, commodity exporter like canada, need chart course domesticmonetary policy independent unite state typically arise largeswings commodity prices. because unite state net commodity importer, suchmovements large differential impact two countries, necessitate differentmonetary policy, make possible flexible exchange rate, maintain price stability.facilitating adjustment91011 4 / 11bis central bankers' speech a flexible exchange rate help attain price stability allow domestic monetary policyto focus goal also facilitate domestic economy’s adjustment externalshocks. whether shock global trade war recession key trade partner,commodity price typically hit first. they bellwether global economic conditionsbecause actively trade global market new information rapidly processedand embed prices.chart 4 show commodity price respond global forces. for example, entry chinainto world trade organization global economy spark run-up demandfor commodity price 2002 2007, opposite occur greatrecession 2008–09. in cases, exchange rate move largely tandem indexof commodity prices.but flexible exchange rate actually smooth economic adjustment commodityprice shock? let’s analyze recent example depth.during oil price shock 2014–15, price west texas intermediate decline 67per cent, us$103 per barrel second quarter 2014 us$34 first quarter of2016. over period, canadian dollar depreciate 20 per cent 92 centsus 73 cent us.but attempt hold canadian dollar steady, even key exportcommodity drop value? it wouldn’t easy. the obvious way limit fall ofthe dollar would bank raise interest rates. we estimate prop theloonie—avoiding 20 per cent depreciation—would require u increase policyrate 6.75 per cent 2015 additional 25 basis point early 2016. you recallthat 2015 actually cut policy rate twice, 25 basis point time, 1.0 0.5per cent.those hypothetical rate increase hold dollar fix would tremendous adverseeffects real economy. instead stimulate growth rate cuts, rate increaseswould low level gross domestic product (gdp) $60 billion early 2016—3.1per cent actually achieved.in addition, total hour work would 4.7 per cent low early 2016. that translatesinto 900,000 few jobs—increasing unemployment rate 4 percentage pointsin 2016. in addition, nominal wage would 2.5 per cent lower. finally, inflation wouldhave 0.8 percentage point low 2016.but 20 per cent depreciation dollar facilitate economic adjustment? becausethe dollar decline le price oil, relative price good service rosecompared oil. this relative price change provide strong signal firm allocate peopleand capital away oil sector toward sector economy. the depreciationalso make foreign good service expensive, cause canadian firm householdsto switch spend away foreign good service toward aredomestically produced. therefore, flexible exchange rate doesn’t absorb commodity priceshock much help economy adjust easily shock smooth theadjustment relative prices.this relatively smooth adjustment stark contrast counterfactual exercise therelative price adjustment occur sharp fall output, pronounce rise inunemployment low wage prices.in alberta, you’ve see side adjustment. when oil price rise 2002 and2008, canadian dollar soar alongside reach parity u dollar. ontario’smanufacturing sector lose competitiveness good become expensive overseas, and121314 5 / 11bis central bankers' speech investment worker flow energy sector alberta saskatchewan.of course, flow reverse 2014–15 oil price fell dollar depreciated. alberta’seconomy ebb region expanded, canadian economy force toadjust.recently, economist argue adjustment benefit flexible exchange rateis le advertised, part u dollar become dominant currency inpricing many good trade countries. consequently, exchange rate movementsmay affect relative price import export (also know term trade). this,in turn, would reduce role exchange rate movement facilitate adjustment. forexample, commodity export typically price u dollars, exchange ratedepreciation would large impact us-dollar price thus lead moreexport sales.however, evidence canada support argument. even though 80per cent import 90 per cent export price u dollars,exchange rate movement play critical role help canadian economy adjust tolarge commodity price movements.recent work gopinath (2017), example, maintain prevalence us-dollar pricingimplies export price u dollar fall country’s currency depreciates, thetraditional stimulative effect export occur. but evidence base export ofnon-commodities. such differentiate good normally carry profit margin use toabsorb exchange rate movements. consequently, argument le relevant canada andother major commodity exporter exporter see profit rise adepreciation tend expand production exports. moreover, us-dollar price notnecessarily entail fix us-dollar price cases; large persistent exchange ratedepreciations may encourage exporter reduce us-dollar price expand sales.clarifying enhance rolesbefore adoption current inflation-targeting framework, goal monetary policywere unclear. market participant often perceive bank canada place weighton stabilize exchange rate objective monetary policy, cloud role anddiminishing ability respond external shocks.however, primary goal monetary policy become much clear inflation target wasadopted, especially 2 per cent target gain credibility. with monetary policy moreclearly credibly focus price stability, role exchange rate also become sharper—specifically respond external shocks, and, particular, commodity price movements.the compel evidence clarification role come recent researchconducted bank. this research find that, 1991, bank’s policy rate respond tomovements exchange rate u federal reserve fund rate addition toeconomic conditions. since 1992, however, reaction policy rate exchange rateessentially disappeared. simply, inflation target allow bank focus monetary policyon price stability.this find corroborate evidence suggest exchange rate become moresensitive commodity price movement inflation target adopted. in chart 4 andchart 6, correlation exchange rate country-specific commodity priceindexes increase canada, australia chile, example, inflation target wasintroduced.15161718192021 6 / 11bis central bankers' speech chart 7 illustrate success framework. when inflation target adopt 1991,inflation become low stable. at time, flexible exchange rate help facilitateadjustment commodity price movement global shocks.hence, monetary policy become effective adoption inflation target becausethe role monetary policy exchange rate become clear credible.promoting financial developmentbut even independent monetary policy flexible exchange rate buff bad theeconomic storms, sustain strong economic growth canada require well-developedfinancial

deepening. moreover, thisfinancial deepen has, turn, enhance transmission monetary policy improve thefunctioning flexible exchange rate.our financial system evolve provide safe efficient intermediation foreign capitalflows. in addition, stability canadian financial system credibility canadianeconomic political institution allow domestic firm government issue debtabroad canadian

and1980s, bank canada intervene ongoing basis provide liquidity andreduce volatility. however, 1990s, intervention end foreign exchange marketand forward fx fx swap interest rate swap market become much deep moreliquid. these market allow canadian firm manage exchange rate risk risksassociated international transaction relatively low cost.canada’s experience indicate market-determined exchange rate, especially withan inflation target—in conjunction robust financial regulatory supervisory frameworkand sustainable fiscal policy—fosters financial development. in words, market becomemore complete. the intermediation foreign capital flow become safe efficient anda country’s ability issue debt currency increases, thereby reduce likelihood ofcurrency mismatch balance sheet.the lesson unique canada. there much evidence financial deepen ascountries adopt monetary policy framework target inflation. recent bank research findsthat adopt monetary policy framework consist inflation

provide clearly state objective areacceptable rest club.yes, sides. this bilateral game, it’s sides. and i think it’s difficult tomake progress can’t build trust. and since talk trust uncertainty indifficult times, i think idea discuss mini-bots mistake. president draghi saidthat it’s legal tender, it’s illegal it’s debt, pile debt. also, view, theworst consequence kind decision destroy trust.

bundesbank guest house set tone joint conference banque de france household expectations.in early 20th century, world stunned. wilhelm von osten, german mathematics teacher, present horse appear able correctly perform arithmetic calculations. the horse, call “kluger hans” (or “clever hans”), could also read clock, form sentence reply questions, give answer tap hoof. a public commission set study intelligent animal, could ﬁnd evidence hoax. it young researcher eventually discover go on. after year training, “clever hans” able identify tiny change questioners’ facial expression unintentionally signal expect behaviour. without facial contact, horse could perform tasks. this show observers’ expectation impact observation.expectations matter welcome remark joint conference household expectation  1 introduction2 take different inﬂation expectation account3 gain deep insight household surveys4 conclusion[1] similarly, economy mechanical system combine labour input, capital technology: also drive expectations. at least since john muth introduce concept rational expectation 1961, case expectation economic agent play key role economic theory policy. after experience stagﬂation 1970s, central bank around world today acknowledge importance anchor inﬂation expectation preserve credibility monetary policy. this also reﬂected estimate phillips curve demonstrate inﬂation expectation one key determinant actual inﬂation.2 take different inflation expectation accounthowever, question whose inﬂation expectation matter monetary policy indicator monitored. in term inﬂation pressure arise labour good markets, would appropriate consider inﬂation expectation across ﬁrms household engage markets. economic experts, meanwhile, may good inform monetary policy central bank intentions. and forecast could also provide guidance agents. in contrast survey-based indicators, high-frequency data expectation extract ﬁnancial market indicator swap rate break-even inﬂation rates. however, measure may combine expectation preference investors. a result, indicator extract market price may deviate expect inﬂation surveys. moreover, market price may include liquidity premia blur picture.recently, ﬁve-year inﬂation-linked swap rate ﬁve year ahead drop considerably euro area. by contrast, long-term inﬂation expectation ecbsurvey professional forecasters, instance, remain stable, qualitative consumer expectation express european commission’s survey virtually unchanged.according ecb calculations, recent drop market-based indicator reﬂects, ﬁrst foremost, fall inﬂation risk premium, rather expect inﬂation.as possible reasons, bundesbank analysis point difference liquidity scarcity premia across bonds. furthermore, behaviour speciﬁc group investor might contribute recent developments. for example, life insurer pension fund may face high risk interest rate change arise liabilities, bond yield drop. they could respond invest heavily longer-dated bonds, thereby aggravate decline yield affect market-based indicator inﬂation expectations.[2][3][4] overall, market-based measure probably representative present, inﬂation expectation relevant monetary policy. this episode highlight various indicator different advantage shortcomings.in general, view substitutes, use instead complementary information.3 gain deep insight household surveysunfortunately, still lack frequent, detail quantitative data inﬂation expectation household ﬁrms. there diﬃculties involve implement survey ﬁrm level. in particular, hard identify reach person within company involve price wage setting. survey household straightforward implement, study academic central banker quite time. moreover, recent work yuriy gorodnichenko keynote speaker olivier coibion show household survey can, instances, provide good information ﬁrms’ expectation professional forecast market-based inﬂation expectations. for example, disagreement among ﬁrms macroeconomic prospect resemble dispersion expectation among household term size, persistence asymmetry.but household expectation also direct importance monetary transmission process. households’ inﬂation expectations, instance, relate purchase intention therefore affect private consumption. furthermore, household expectation economic variable inﬂation also relevant central banks. if conduct national level, additional household survey could focus detect idiosyncratic features. in particular, data may matter national mandate macroprudential policy.in order gain comprehensive picture, bundesbank carry pilot study internet-based household survey monthly basis. the focus lie consumer expectation regard inﬂation development real estate market. the ﬁeld phase complete july. in two session conference, ﬁndings several study internal external researcher base pilot’s data present specialist audience ﬁrst time.as appetiser, i privilege give sneak peek key result core question pilot survey advance: first, median inﬂation expectation twelve-month horizon 2% three survey waves. that low similar ussurveys indicate german consumers’ inﬂation expectation well-anchored. second, small fraction individual germany – namely 3% 4% – expect inﬂation fall. and share high inﬂation expectation also relatively small. overall, result vary across socio-demographic category income level [5][6][7] education way consistent previous studies. third, individual germany think house price continue rise sharply. roughly 70% question answer already consider real estate neighbourhood overvalued; nonetheless, half person expect price rise further. fourth, tenant predict strong house price increase owners. this interest difference consistent result panel household finance (phf).the bundesbank already conduct phf survey german household wealth debt every three year – 2017, almost 5,000 household participated. in third wave, phf questionnaire expand area include question house price expectations, example. the phf survey recent pilot study allow bundesbank acquire expertise experience. go forward, would much welcome cooperation banque de france high-frequency survey focus household expectations. in addition, ecb recently start develop new consumer expectation survey. accord announcement, pilot survey soon implemented. aside serve practical purpose within central banks, additional survey household expectation would also help promote research. the u clearly ahead ﬁeld, important question whether result obtain would also valid countries.4 conclusionladies gentlemen, discovery “clever han phenomenon” major breakthrough experimental psychology lead research effect expectations. for example, evidence find teachers’ expectation could impact students’ performance. more generally, “clever hans” may highlight importance design experiment properly order avoid bias results. of course, researcher also take lesson heart devise pilot study. by resort internet-based survey, effectively eliminate possible impact face-to-face contact.to conclude, i wish pleasant even fruitful conference. and, ﬁnally, i glad open joint event together governor villeroy de galhau. dear

28 september 2019first all, thank kind invitation take part panel “europe all” conclude second day “giornate di economia” memory marcello de cecco. marcello follow ecb govern council’s decision relate analysis discussion great interest acumen known. today i would like touch upon three points: 1) monetary policy decision taken; 2) economic analysis behind them; 3) debate concerning, assessment of, effectiveness various measure adopted.1. at september meet ecb govern council introduce broad package expansionary measures. it low interest rate deposit bank make eurosystem (the deposit facility), negative territory since june 2014, 10 basis point -0.5 per cent. it decide restart net asset purchase monthly pace €20 billion begin november, interrupt december last year, amount €2,600 billion since launch end 2014. it relax term new series target longer-term refinance operation (tltro iii) compare june decision low cost (to -0.5 0.0 per cent depend lend performance individual banks) extend maturity (from two three years). it introduce zero interest rate, oppose negative interest rate, part banks’ liquidity reserve (“tiering”) attenuate risk, fear observers, increasingly negative interest rate deposit facility could counterproductive effect banks’ balance sheet and, turn, lending.in addition, strengthen forward guidance concern future path monetary policy, signal expectation keep key ecb interest rate present low value inflation get level consistently close 2 per cent medium term. 22. these decision make haste: natural conclusion analysis start quite time ago govern council and, take together, appropriate proportional response worsen macroeconomic outlook euro area. in previous meetings, already broad agreement outlook economic activity price disappointing. in july, reiterate determination intervene decisively medium-term inflation outlook fail improve. over last months, sign economic slowdown weaken inflation instead intensified. geopolitical tensions, include relate trade tariffs, sharp decline international trade record last quarter continue weigh firms’ confidence, investment industrial production. the assessment who, one year ago, expect weaken economic activity would prove temporary would eventually subside show increasingly optimistic.the slowdown substantial german and, though le so, italian industrial production, would naïve underestimate scope consider asymmetric shock. if worsen manufacture sector prof persistent, inevitably reverberate across sector economy. this confirm recent data, point area-wide slowdown activity service sector, especially germany.in slow economy, surprise inflation remain moderate well objective close 2 per cent annual increase consumer price euro area; even margin uncertainty, forecast indicate inflation expect remain weak next two years. we must counter significant risk economic slowdown low level inflation translate permanent reduction inflation expectation re-emergence threat deflation. the analysis conduct bank italy clearly demonstrate risk, regardless measure expect inflation used: similar trend observe expectation derive financial markets, may affect excessive reactivity part investors, obtain survey professional forecasters, firm households.a recent study bank italy economist find medium- long-term inflation expectation ecb’s survey professional forecaster much susceptible negative surprise current inflation past. this find confirm one researcher already obtain base inflation expectation derive inflation swaps. by measures, recent months, expectation remain far objective price stability; increase slightly spring, turn again.the govern council deem necessary respond promptly worsen economic situation, order reiterate intention confront weaken aggregate demand effect prices, fall behind curve counter low inflation expectation determination. the global financial crisis sovereign debt crisis 23have teach u circumstance excessive prudence counterproductive: respond swiftly risk low inflation long, lengthy incisive measure, carry great risk unintended side effects, need counter risk deflation. 3. there extensive discussion govern council decision measure introduce; course, opinion vary reservation express regard certain individual instrument characteristics. the package measure adopt receive approval majority member govern council. the analysis conduct bank italy indicate reason doubt overall effectiveness.in current circumstances, uncertainty effect individual instrument naturally widespread, analysis suggest purchase programme is, present conditions, effective instrument (aside “conventional” one, give open market operation always feature central bankers’ “toolbox”). our estimate suggest impact new purchase economic activity inflation, contraction term premia transmission yield financial assets, much big today cut official rates. from conceptual empirical perspective, reason rule possibility contraction term premia, event already occur consolidation expectation new measures.as i often observed, effect reduction official rate negative value – truly “unconventional” instrument among introduce far govern council – surround great uncertainty. we estimate far, cut reference rate significant expansionary effects; road, however, effectiveness could prove doubtful, especially view downwards rigidity interest rate deposits.in event, forget persistence negative nominal interest rate across broad spectrum maturity lengthy period cannot attribute solely decision central banks, react macroeconomic conditions, rather reflect endure underlie weakness economy possible market response resurgence fisherian debt deflation. we still quite far “normal” economic condition ought return (also view structural factor could explain low growth rate worldwide recent decades). the introduction two-tier system bank reserve remuneration – also adopt jurisdiction – intend prevent reduction official rate negative value having, beyond certain level, undesirable side effect impair banks’ ability grant credit and, therefore, transform restrictive factor. nevertheless, encourage great trade bank seek high return liquidity may spark tension money market rates, risk counter calibration choose one must still carefully monitored. 4in forward guidance, govern council confirm determination respond symmetrically inflation developments, word intervene inflation fall target determination rise it. the aim avoid downward revision inflation expectations, resurface deflation risk successfully counter three year ago, whilst simultaneously guarantee financial condition capable support economic cycle.monetary policy resolutely pursue objective price stability. to achieve maximum benefit action, govern council unanimously agree that, give slowdown production significant downside risk weigh outlook, fiscal policy must make incisive contribution strengthen aggregate demand. during phase, country room intervene play important stabilize role; high public debt must prioritize rebalancing expenditure towards measure good able support growth, public investment, reduce tax burden business employment. * * *in conclusion, i think package measure adopt necessary appropriate counter cyclical risk weak inflation outlook, fully line previous decisions. in past, i always avoid give opinion monetary policy decision immediately govern council meetings. i decide today, week last decision taken, mainly recent medium attention give discussion follow meeting.intense detail internal discussion monetary policy option indispensable, always take place. many observer wonder whether dissemination comment immediately follow common decision practice counterproductive, useful even necessary. we debate merit introduce ecb procedure follow central banks, where, follow monetary policy meetings, publish position participant (as well reason disagreements). this solution, i personally find appropriate, one point consider reject govern council.in remarkable scientific output, numerous article public large, marcello de cecco always highlight close tie geopolitical issue economic events. it interest today go back read one last article publish affari e finanza end 2015. it deal decision adopt ecb govern council december year expand asset purchases. just happen day ago, member council publicly express disagreement decision; i sure today disagreement regard possible result decision would express quite forcefully. i think comment make governor end govern council meet guide preconceive idea political considerations, marcello seem think case back then, guide abstract 45division “hawks” “doves” press sometimes like believe. i sure comment reflect genuine conviction council member useful measure euro-area economy. however, institutional context economic monetary union, still important avoid risk that, also due extemporaneous nature remark made, position individual council member interpret expression national perspective interests, rather relate area whole. for reason, i believe need work make decision-making process transparent possible. tmsustainable

discourage demand; time, high price provide incentive search new production method utilize few resources.over last decades, big concern relation effect climate change. be concern different past? one key difference compare issue depletion natural resource that, case climate change, “natural” market prices. climate change is, fact, classic example negative externality: cost spill onto market besides one originated. in addition, point william nordhaus nobel 2lecture, climate change particularly thorny externality owe global nature, put outside domain market also national governments.the danger climate change, close link emission greenhouse gas (including, limit to, carbon dioxide) and, turn, human activity production consumption, know time. for example, professor nordhaus himself, write sharp criticism result club rome almost 50 year ago, regard climate change “a major threat human natural world” – concern hard share. since pioneer study mid-1970s climate economy co-evolve, earn 2018 nobel prize economic sciences, trend emission greenhouse gas continue worrisome. in fact, grow use fossil fuel push greenhouse gas concentration level that, unless forceful measure taken, estimate lead increase temperature planet range 3 5 degree celsius end century. this well beyond threshold 1.5 degree that, surpassed, would bring potentially catastrophic consequence planet, accord unite nation intergovernmental panel climate change.some effect already evident. at global level, last four year warm since 1880; last july hot month record planet. in italy, year 2018 record high average temperature past two century (the period reliable data available) 2017 already characterize significant intensification extreme weather events, severe case drought serious repercussion water supply.stopping climate change require strong political determination firm commitment countries, also sustain effort institution individuals. achieve objective first foremost responsibility national governments, institution provide incentive allocate capital “green” investments, levy tax carbon emissions, introduce regulation limit amount allowable emissions. reach international agreement global carbon tax share target emission also rest within powers.the difficulty reduce emission sufficiently across country enormous, evident last years. therefore, institution individual play part foster economic growth “sustainable” – i.e. meet current need without compromise future generation (as define un “brundtland commission” 1987). public institution could promote sustainable business practice envision strategy induce firm take account environment, human rights, consumer right diversity, well best practice corporate governance – so-called environmental, social governance (esg) profiles.firms successful adopt appropriate esg profile adjust investment accordingly expect significant advantages. in fact, “green” sector steadily grow around globe italy well. the available data show “eco-industrial” sector expand markedly country recent years: 2017 23it contribute 2.3 per cent total value added, employ nearly 400,000 full-time equivalent workers.given central role allocation resources, financial sector key influence scope, speed smoothness transition low-emissions economy. however, effectively bank financial intermediary integrate sustainability investment decision-making processes, especially corporate governance system risk management investment strategies.several challenges, however, lie ahead. currently, neither widely accept rule esg data disclosure individual firm agree audit standard verify report data. moreover, intrinsic difficulty decide indicator relevant assign esg score – think, example, problem evaluate “social” component – especially compare financial aggregates, key indicators, revenues, costs, earn cash flows, widely available auditable items. apparently, esg-score provider rely heavily voluntary disclosure firm subjective methodology select, ass weight individual esg indicators. this, course, add arbitrary nature scores. a result, esg score individual firm differ greatly across rat agency compared, example, credit ratings. accord study line exist literature, correlation esg score assign major list company euro area three main provider range 40 60 per cent, compare correlation credit rat 90 per cent. there also evidence

policy japan speech meet business leader mie bank japan september 25, 2019 (english translation base japanese original) 1 i. development economic activity price i would like start speech look development economic activity prices. follow discussion monetary policy meet (mpm) hold july 29 30, 2019, bank japan publish outlook economic activity prices, outlook report. in report, bank present projection japan's economic activity price fiscal 2021. i explain development economic activity price present main content outlook report. a. overseas economy let first touch development overseas economies. the bank ass that, although overseas economy grow moderately whole, slowdown continue observed. private consumption firm whole, mainly due favorable employment income situation. however, effect trade friction become evident form deceleration pace increase world trade volume, confirm this, together adjustment cycle it-related goods, lead deterioration business sentiment decline propensity toward investment, particularly manufacture sector. indeed, global purchase managers' index (pmi) manufacture 50 mark continue decline since may 2019 -- is, four consecutive month -- u.s. ism manufacture index also fell 50 august first time since august 2016 -- is, three years. my view central bank international organization share concern situation. for instance, g20 osaka leaders' declaration adopt june 2019 state "[global economic] growth remain low risk remain tilt downside." accord world economic outlook (weo) update release july 2019 international monetary fund (imf), growth rate global economy project decelerate 3.2 percent 2019 pick 3.5 percent -- 2 level past average -- 2020; however, projection revise downward previous one make april 2019 weo, mark fourth consecutive downward revision. moreover, indicate imf projection "precarious" presume progress make toward resolve trade policy differences. look development major region, u.s. economy continue underpin household sector backdrop solid growth employment income. although economic growth country -- france -- underpin consumption, european economy whole, contrast, see move defer investment, partly backdrop uncertainty political developments, sign business sentiment manufacture firm -- especially germany -- bottom out. with regard germany particular, deutsche bundesbank assess growth rate economy july-september quarter 2019 could negative second consecutive quarter, follow april-june quarter. the chinese economy continue see stable growth whole, weakness observe manufacturing, suggest indicator industrial output -- growth july low level ten half year decelerate august. in emerge commodity-exporting economies, ny asean economies, effect adjustment it-related goods, example, observed. in term outlook overseas economies, slowdown likely continue time being; thereafter, however, economy expect grow moderately whole, growth rate rise somewhat, partly due effect economy's stimulus measure pick-up manufacturing, relatively weak development observe mainly it-related capital goods. nevertheless, concern that, brexit deadline approaching, global financial market condition might suddenly change depend outcome negotiation unite kingdom's exit european union (eu), i view downside risk business activity remain significant, mainly manufacturing, trade issue become chronic, 3 particularly unite state china. accordingly, i pay particular attention time pace pick-up overseas economies. b. japan's economy 1. current situation now i would like move development japan's economy. the bank ass japan's economy moderate expand trend, virtuous cycle income spend operating, although exports, production, business sentiment affect slowdown overseas economies. the assessment underlie trend whole unchanged previous outlook report release april 2019, slowdown overseas economy seem affect export production, see date, also business sentiment firm well manufacturers' machinery investment, among others. in meantime, domestic demand, business fix investment, maintain firmness, mainly nonmanufacturing, private consumption increase moderately, albeit fluctuations; thus, output gap remain positive real gdp growth rate april-june quarter 2019, release august, 1.3 percent annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, register positive figure third consecutive quarter. look development major expenditure item, corporate profit stay relatively high level whole, uptrend business fix investment maintained, mainly investment intend domestic capacity expansion, aim save labor order deal labor shortage, research development growth areas. especially nonmanufacturing, increase observe construction logistics facilities, reflect expansion e-commerce business, accommodation facility meet demand inbound visitors. meanwhile, accord financial statement statistic corporation industry, quarterly, business fix investment manufacture firm april-june quarter 2019 minus 6.9 percent year-on-year basis, fall previous year's level first time two years, due mainly effect trade issues. private consumption maintain 4 moderate increase trend labor market condition remain tight income situation continue improve, albeit fluctuation result weather conditions. export continue show weakness, mainly reflect effect slowdown overseas economies. a result situation, production mainly export-related good exhibit weak developments, industrial production whole le flat. in circumstances, business sentiment weaken somewhat, mainly manufacturing. 2. baseline scenario outlook economic activity japan's economy likely continue expand trend throughout projection period, cover fiscal 2019 fiscal 2021. in fiscal 2019, export project continue show weakness time being, reflect slowdown overseas economies, business fix investment also likely decelerate somewhat, mainly manufacturing. thereafter, export project return moderate increase trend, growth rate overseas economy rise gradually. the rate increase business fix investment expect rise somewhat due increases, example, labor-saving investment. private consumption likely push time due effect schedule consumption tax hike, expect continue increase employment income situation continue improve. public investment also likely increase, reflect olympic games-related demand expansion expenditure national resilience. in fiscal 2020, pace increase export expect accelerate, growth rate overseas economy rising, government spend accompany host olympic game expect underpin economy. business fix investment likely maintain moderate uptrend. private consumption house investment expect head gradually toward recovery decline schedule consumption tax hike. in fiscal 2021, private consumption house investment project increase effect reactionary decline schedule consumption tax hike 5 likely dissipate, although olympic games-related expenditure -- increase -- completed. export business fix investment likely maintain moderate uptrend. in term median policy board members' forecast july outlook report, real gdp growth rate 0.7 percent fiscal 2019, 0.9 percent fiscal 2020, 1.1 percent fiscal 2021. 3. uncertainty regard baseline scenario economic activity there various uncertainty regard baseline scenario outlook japan's economic activity, i would like explain two point i currently pay particular attention. first risk time bottom external demand delay. since latter half 2018, i assess risk tilt downside, particularly regard development overseas economies. recently, due political factor strengthen protectionist moves, downside risk seem increase further. i concern could affect time bottom external demand various channel include disruption financial market reduction firms' incentive invest cause development trade. second effect consumption tax hike schedule take place october 2019. the plan increase tax rate small time previous hike april 2014, government plan implement measure reduce tax rate, point reward program use cashless payments, flexibly pass rise consumption tax sale prices. take consideration, baseline scenario negative impact tax hike growth rate small previous hike. nevertheless, i pay attention future consumption, together possible heighten current geopolitical risks. i would like carefully examine situation, include two points, upcoming october outlook report. 6 c. price development 1. current situation next, i turn price development japan. the year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food currently around 0.5 percent; seem hit lull somewhat uptrend, effect energy price drop start appear. nevertheless, general public's gut feel seem price rise gradually. i believe affect rise price food products, staple purchases. actually, year-on-year rate change cpi saw acceleration growth increase number food product since early spring; addition, unit value price index release hitotsubashi university (sri-hitotsubashi consumer purchase index) nikkei cpinow-t index, calculate base point-of-sales (pos) data collect supermarkets, example, maintain high growth. a describe comprehensive assessment: development economic activity price well policy effect since introduction quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe), release bank september 2016, adaptive component play considerably large role japan country formation inflation expectations, mean inflation expectation tend influence past inflation rates. a similar trend confirm subsequent studies.1 in words, important make cumulative effort raise inflation rates; gertler point out, economy barely history inflation anchor target rate, "they [individuals] see believe it."2 from viewpoint, understand 1 see, example, toshitaka maruyama kenji suganuma, "inflation expectation curve japan," bank japan work paper series, no.19-e-6, april 2019, http://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2019/data/wp19e06.pdf. 2 mark gertler, "rethinking power forward guidance: lesson japan," imes discussion paper series, no. 2017-e-8, bank japan, institute monetary economic study (imes), october 2017, https://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/papers/english/17-e-08.pdf. 7 several sign change recently start appear arise situation gradually take positive steps. in fact, contrast year-on-year rate increase cpi item le fresh food i mention earlier, item le fresh food energy remain flat level around 0.5 percent since begin fiscal year. in addition, sign change -- albeit slight -- seem appear view fact price rise firm begin spread broad range products, give data, trimmed-mean cpi, exclude extreme relative price changes. turn inflation expectations, expect inflation rate next five year surpass 1 percent first time since 2013, accord estimation bank's staff base result opinion survey general public's view behavior. the fact adaptive component play considerably large role explain people's mindset behavior base assumption wage price increase easily deeply entrenched. i assume household gain cumulative experience rise base pay six consecutive year year-on-year rate increase employee income quarterly basis 26 quarter row, although rate increase modest. a matter fact, households' tolerance price rises, bank's staff calculated, seem improve trend, i view also sign positive changes. a i explain far, i sense that, although still distance go achieve price stability target 2 percent, sign momentum toward achieve target could strengthen again. in words, i feel approach important phase firms' households' tolerance price rise could base empirical analysis, follow paper conclude individuals' expectation future inflation rate influence inflation rate actually experienced. jess diamond, kota watanabe, tsutomu watanabe, "the formation consumer inflation expectations: new evidence from japan's deflation experience," bank japan work paper series, no.19-e-13, august 2019, http://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2019/data/ wp19e13.pdf. 8 improve, expect inflation rate could rise further. therefore, i believe extremely important encourage development. 2. baseline scenario outlook price with regard outlook prices, year-on-year rate change cpi item le fresh food likely increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly back output gap remain positive medium- long-term inflation expectation rising. the median policy board members' forecast year-on-year rate change cpi item le fresh food present july outlook report 1.0 percent fiscal 2019, 1.3 percent fiscal 2020, 1.6 percent fiscal 2021. 3. risk price specific risk factor price development firms' households' medium- long-term inflation expectations, fact responsiveness price item output gap low, development foreign exchange rate international commodity price go forward. my recent concern that, amid significant downside risk concern overseas economies, negative effect would exert price third risk factor case disruption global financial markets. ii. the bank's monetary policy next, i talk bank's monetary policy. a. current monetary policy framework the bank set price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi conduct monetary policy achieve target early possible time. specifically, framework qqe yield curve control, support economic activity firm household maintain highly accommodative financial conditions. this framework mainly consist four components: yield curve control, purchase risky assets, inflation-overshooting commitment, forward guidance policy rates. the first component, yield curve control, policy bank aim keep short- 9 long-term interest rate stable low levels. namely, guideline market operations, bank set short-term policy interest rate minus 0.1 percent target level 10-year japanese government bond (jgb) yield around 0 percent, conduct jgb purchase achieve target level. the second component purchase risky assets; view low risk premia asset prices, bank purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) amount outstanding increase annual pace 6 trillion yen 90 billion yen, respectively. the third component, inflation-overshooting commitment, policy bank commit continue expand monetary base -- total amount money bank directly supply economy -- year-on-year rate increase observe cpi exceed 2 percent stay level stable manner. the fourth component, forward guidance policy rates, present bank's stance maintain current extremely low level short- long-term interest rate extend period time, least around spring 2020, take account uncertainty regard economic activity price include development overseas economy effect schedule consumption tax hike. b. persistently continue powerful monetary ease the bank introduce qqe april 2013 continue powerful monetary easing. however, gradually become clear likely would still take time achieve price stability target 2 percent, decide strengthen framework qqe yield curve control july 2018. specifically, decide enhance sustainability powerful monetary ease (1) strengthen commitment achieve price stability target introduce forward guidance policy rate (2) conduct market operation asset purchase flexible manner. to elaborate second point, bank announce that, purchase jgbs, yield might move upward downward extent, mainly depend development economic activity prices. it also decide conduct purchase flexible manner amount outstanding would increase annual pace 80 trillion yen. furthermore, decide purchase etf j-reits amount outstanding would increase annual pace 6 trillion yen 90 billion yen, respectively. at time, view low risk premia asset price appropriate manner, bank 10 announce might increase decrease amount purchase depend market conditions. by allow elasticity monetary policy framework, bank respond flexibly extent development financial markets. moreover, april 2019, bank make clear policy stance persistently continue powerful monetary easing. specifically, regard forward guidance policy rates, bank add development overseas economy factor consider judge whether would maintain current extremely low level short- long-term interest rates; addition, clearly present point reference expression "for extend period time" least around spring 2020. furthermore, order contribute smooth implementation fund-provisioning asset purchase well secure market functioning, bank decide take follow measure initiative: (1) expand eligible collateral bank's provision credit; (2) improve use fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth; (3) relax term condition security lend facility (slf); (4) consider introduce etf lend facility. the bank persistently continue powerful monetary ease sustainable manner framework qqe yield curve control devise measure consider necessary time strengthen framework. c. cop current uncertainty my understand global financial market whole remain risk averse, development seem strengthen recently amid rapid alternation pessimism optimism due factor strong political nature. for example, germany, interest rate instrument overnight loan 30-year government bond temporarily become negative, switzerland, interest rate instrument 50-year government bond negative one point. in unite states, yield 10-year treasury fall close low level mark global financial crisis; market participant seem various interpretation implication invert yield curve, observe since mid-august, yield 10-year treasury decline 2-year treasuries. in meantime, major economies' 11 central banks, federal reserve european central bank (ecb), shift accommodative policy stance prevent uncertainty global economy affect domestic regional economic activity prices. in respect, bank consider important thoroughly examine risk overseas economy carefully ass risk could affect japan's economic activity prices. base examination, bank, like central banks, hesitate take additional ease measure great possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target lost. to clarify intention, july 2019 statement monetary policy, bank present stance "will hesitate take additional ease measure great possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target lost." moreover, statement release september 19, bank judge become necessary pay close attention possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target would lost. base judgment, add expression that, take situation account, would reexamine economic price development next mpm, discus october outlook report. actual economic condition face central bank extremely complex change dynamically course time. on point, jackson hole symposium 2018, discussion implication monetary policy arise various structural change occur recent years, include digital innovation increase type non-tangible asset software, intellectual property, brand equity. moreover, jackson hole symposium hold year, federal reserve chairman jerome powell point recent uncertainty new challenge monetary policy management.3 in fact, strengthen protectionist move recently appear one factor make situation even complicated. 3 this economic symposium, hold annually jackson hole, wyoming, august, host federal reserve bank kansa city. prominent central bankers, finance ministers, academic around world convene discus topic global economy monetary policy. 12 i intend continue conduct monetary policy appropriately toward achieve price stability target consider conceivable adverse effect positive effect every angle well take full consideration notable change environment risk place emphasis. see jerome h. powell, "challenges monetary policy: remark symposium host federal reserve bank kansa city," federal reserve bank kansa city, august 2019,

annual meet verein für socialpolitik. we hear interest discussion role central bank process euenlargement. i would like thank panelist contributions!the discussion show central bank play important role european integration process – within euro area also european union whole. let give example bundesbank contribute constructive partner decision-making europe: monetary policy decision take eurosystem level, base analytical work committee within european central bank bundesbank actively contributes. cross-border cooperation coordination also play central role ﬁnancial stability, establish new mandate central bank ﬁnancial crisis. in europe, ﬁnancial stability fall national responsibility close coordination eu institution national authorities. the european level power top national policy decision deem insuﬃcient address ﬁnancial stability risks. likewise, bank supervision share responsibility: even systemically important bank supervise single supervisory mechanism (ssm), national authority play important role on-site supervision. and, least, work closely partner europe ensure statistical report granular data improve across europe.these example show good analytical skill key central bank play competent role european integration process. central bank certainly operate environment political discussion important societal questions. central banks’ contribution debate need base mandate rigorous empirical analysis. maintain high analytical quality is, indeed, one core strategic goal bundesbank.therefore, careful observer initiative evidence-based

post-crisis ﬁnancial sector reforms, and, generally, effectiveness policy internalize externality – ﬁnancial sector regard environmental spillovers. not question answer hard, causal evidence. but learn economy functioning, understand mechanism incentive policy instrument affect way people ﬁrms behave crucial.the best strategy counter distrust public authority spread “fake news” structure policy process. we need transparency policy institution operate, least good communication. notwithstanding erosion trust government political institution since crisis, indeed great demand reliable evidence expert knowledge. accord survey pew research center, example, demand scientiﬁc knowledge unite state fairly high even increase slightly recent years. yet, view diverge regard role scientist play policy debates; potential bias lack independence expert view issue many respondent consider relevant. trust thus important, trust need earned. trust also imply citizen want transparent objective decision make process. therefore, take principle evidence-based policy heart work operationalizing policy area responsible.generally speaking, lot also happen regard evidence-based policy make past years. let give example: very nearby, halle institute economic research found centre evidence-based policy advice (iwh-cep) 2014. this platform aim create good foundation evaluation policy measures,

two decade euro: portugal’s perspectivelecture governor carlos da silva costa occasion visit hrvatska narodna banka, zagreb [1]1. introductory remarksgood morning.i would like thank governor boris vujčić kind invitation visit croatian national bank opportunity share portuguese experiencewith euro step lead adoption 1999.first i would like express satisfaction croatia’s intention join erm ii bank union mid-2020, well congratulate croatian authority remarkable progress country make since become part european union.as one eleven found member euro area, portugal's preparation introduction single currency take place different context one croatia adopt euro.on one hand, because, time, process involve simultaneous assessment theeuropean union (eu) country launch completely new currency. in particular, required:•(i) a decision country fulfil necessary conditions;início > intervenção governador, carlos da silva costa, banco central da croácia (apenas em inglês) > intervenção governador, carlos da silva costa, banco central da croácia (apenas em inglês)intervenção governador, carlos da silva costa, banco central da croácia (apenas em inglês) •(ii) the creation multiple eu-wide preparatory work-streams coordination network level central bank public administration among others, ensure smooth balance transition;•(iii) the launch euro subsequent physical introduction previously non-existent note coins.on hand, european regulatory framework institutional architecture significantly evolve since then, notably follow response financial crisis establishment bank union.however, despite difference framework condition start points, i convince portuguese experience exchange rate mechanism (erm) european monetary system euro thelessons draw experience may provide useful point reference croatia.in order give complete picture, allow highlight key development regime change experience portuguese economy last four decades, start word period accession european economic community (eec), january 1986.2. before eec accessionin late 1970s early 1980s portuguese economy characterise severe macroeconomic imbalances, significant market distortions, large public sector poor economic performance. the root cause macroeconomic imbalance essentially excessive domestic demand growth relation productive capacity economy, lead external debt accumulation.to overcome balance payment difficulties, portugal negotiate two imf programmes, 1977-1978 1983. the implementation package successful attain targets.in context monetary sovereignty, imbalance translate currency depreciation, international reserve depletion high rise inflation rate (annual inflation 21.4%, average, period 1978-1985, reach almost 30% 1984). the policy prescription time consist interest rate increases, credit growth ceilings, capital control devaluation national currency, escudo, contain domestic demand restore export competitiveness. with aim, crawling-peg regime introduce august 1977, month first imf stabilisation package.as result adjustment strategy followed, real value wages, pension save decline sharply wealth transfer creditor debtors. money illusion blur perception adjustment cost fundamentally unbalance burden-sharing.the 1983 programme bring current account back balance put inflation general government deficit decline path. however, 1985, year precede portugal’s accession eec, inflation still run around 20% (14 percentage point community average), general government deficit exceed 8% gdp gdp per caput 50% community average, reflect country’s low productivity levels.3. from eec accession adoption euroaccession european economic community january 1986 critical regime change portuguese economy. it pose many difficult challenge also provide many key opportunities. increase trade financial integration, late commitment become found member monetary union, provide critical “stick carrot” portugal follow path base prevalence market mechanism pursuit macroeconomic stability. 1986-early 1992: eec accession erm participationfrom eec accession early 1992, economic policy drive need implement single market programme acquis communautaire.the performance portuguese economy improve significantly rapid catching-up process start (gdp per caput grow 5.8%, average period 1986-1991). however, sign increasingly overheat economy also become apparent domestic production limit capacity constraint tight labour market. an increasingly unbalance policy-mix exacerbate excess demand.disinflation become major goal economic policy portuguese authority progressively adopt monetary policy strategy base exchange rate stability intermediate target reach final goal price stability. the exchange rate policy become progressively le accommodative, aim break vicious circle inflation-devaluation without jeopardise sustainability external accounts.from 1986 onward, escudo’s monthly depreciation rate successively cut october 1990 crawling-peg regime abandoned. in addition, reference basket escudo measure change basket five currency erm. the aim exchange rate regime shift two-fold:•the authority want introduce short-term unpredictability exchange rate escudo order discourage (short-term) capital inflows;•the new regime prepare country future participation erm (seen useful framework pursue disinflation process foster macroeconomic stability). early 1992-1998: erm membershipfrom signature maastricht treaty february 1992 onwards, ensure compliance convergence criterion establish participation third stage economic monetary union (emu) become immediate priority economic policy portugal. one first step direction participation erm.the escudo join erm april 1992, fluctuation band ±6.0% [2] – call ‘wide band’. erm membership underline portuguese authorities’ commitment pursuit non-accommodative exchange rate policy, expect favourable impact inflation expectations. membership also necessary ensure country would candidate adopt single currency start.immediately join erm, escudo become strong currency parity grid, reach ceiling weak currency system, time british pound. however, first year erm participation easy one banco de portugal active keep escudo within band.in summer 1992 escudo catch turmoil affect erm ultimately lead widen fluctuation band ±15.0% august 1993. massive intervention carry out, well measures, defence national currency. the escudo subject one realignment central parity depreciate significantly.it clear erm regime compatible degree openness economy participate internal market existence autonomous monetary policies. it inconsistency lead 1992-1993 currency crisis, direct implication intra-european trade flows. this clearly show practice existence internal market without single currency necessarily represent unstable equilibrium. the need single currency become evident ever.after enlargement erm fluctuation margin increase stability run-up emu. despite deteriorate domestic conditions, portuguese authority exploit increase room manoeuvre provide enlarge bands, official interest rate adjust manner consistent maintenance exchange rate stability. during period erm membership, inflation decline steadily differential european union average virtually eliminated.in fact, since mid-1990s, prospect emu participation foster rapid convergence interest rate level prevail germany (the anchor country erm). prospective emu member state – especially bad track-records term macroeconomic stability – initially benefit virtuous circle nominal convergence prospect emu participation:•on one hand, so-called “converging” countries, policy effort towards fiscal consolidation couple low inflation increase likelihood emu participation (as country become close fulfil maastricht criteria);•on hand, high probability join emu facilitate exchange rate stability, interest rate convergence (declining risk premia) improvement budget balance (lower interest payment public debt). the magnitude involve impressive: 1993 1998 nominal long-term interest rate portugal decline substantially, 10-year interest rate spread german bond narrow around 5 p.p. 0.3 p.p.the sizeable interest rate cut interpret portuguese economic agent largely irreversible, associate new macroeconomic regime characterise price stability. thus, reduction interest rate translate significant slowdown liquidity constraint experience household corporations, provide strong boost domestic demand growth. in addition, participation euro area admittedly bring expansionary effect domestic demand favourable economic outlook, lead economic agent increase consumption investment.after european integration, portugal also experience rapid real convergence, relative position portuguese income per caput rise rapidly vis-à-vis average european levels. in 1998, gdp per caput increase around 70 per cent eu average.table 1 - the portuguese economy 1978-1998: some key figuressources: banco de portugal, national statistic institute, eurostat(1) consumer price index, annual average rate change(2) 1999=1004. two decade eurothe introduction eurofollowing significant progress nominal convergence alignment national legislation eu treaty statute european system central banks, portugal position become one eleven found member euro area. the eu council decision 2 may 1998 confirm portugal fulfil necessary condition adoption single currency.the euro introduce 1 january 1999 foreign exchange financial currency operation vast majority retail operations. however, physical introduction take place 1 january 2002 end february 2002euro banknote coin become legal tender euro area.in portugal, physical replacement escudo euro banknote coin take place normally gradually, follow extensive preparatory work carry banco de portugal entities. in september 2001 euro banknote coin distribute credit institution and, december, large company retailers. finally, 17 december, starter kit worth 10 euro sell public counter banco de portugal credit institutions, contain mix euro coin denominations, portuguese citizen could become familiar new currency.one additional feature portugal introduce legal requirement dual display price around cash changeover (as also case austria greece). dual display allow easy comparison price two denominations, thereby reduce information process cost consumers.the conversion national currency euro give rise fear effect price among general public participate countries. portugal exception. it clear consumer price immune conversion national currency euro. yet, impossible make precise assessment effect inflation several factor simultaneously affect price development 2002. in case portugal, instance, rise standard value add tax (vat) rate 17% 19%, june.however, banco de portugal’s estimate suggest first quarter 2002 overall impact conversion process year-on-year change consumer price index around 0.2 p.p. around 0.5 p.p. case service price [3]. a countries, analysis also confirm sign price increase cause changeover insome specific products, mostly regard frequently buy good service usually pay cash, hence leave consumer feel inflation high due introduction euro. a regard mandatory dual display prices, research publish ecb show dampen effect evolution price [4].the euro provide business household important set tangible visible benefits: low transaction costs; transparent competitive market increase trade; great certainty save investment decisions; easy price comparison; simple shop travel within europe; easy access market new business opportunities.naturally, euro also bring new requirement regard behaviour economic agents,namely exchange rate mechanism compensate difference member state cease available.the overall success portuguese experience convergence period hide important policy fragilities, particularly fiscal domain. in fact, countercyclical fiscal policy would help contain risk associate expansion domestic demand stem monetary ease interest rate declines. and macroprudential policy would provide awareness build-up systemic risk. however, macroprudential policy simply part standard toolbox mostly pro-cyclical fiscal policy follow contribute rise imbalance economy early year emu, make subsequent adjustment painful. let say word this.before 2008 – accumulation macroeconomic imbalancesthe significant degree monetary ease run-up emu provide huge stimulus domestic demand. a “new world” low interest rate abundant finance seem offer free lunch “converging” countries, several imbalance start build-up countries, take different shapes:•in country portugal greece, fiscal imbalance become major problem – even size problem substantially different. in countries, save arise low interest rate boom-related windfall revenue use finance expansionary expenditure policies;•in country spain ireland, fiscal policy prudent. still, imbalance built-up, mainly take form real estate bubble;•in ireland, oversized financial sector develop tandem real estate bubble (a similar phenomenon also occur non-euro eu countries, prominent case iceland).in portugal, mid-1990s 2007, substantial ease liquidity constraint – arise interest rate decline access huge wholesale market fund – lead boom private sector credit fall households’ save rates. from 1995 2007, private sector debt almost double percentage gdp (averaging 187.2% gdp period), households’ save rate almost halved.the increase indebtedness mainly use finance consumption low-return investments, mostly non-tradable sector. a result, import expand large current account deficit materialised, without correspond increase economy’s growth potential. from 1995 2007, current capital account move near balance 8.6% gdp deficit.the public sector also benefit low interest rate easy access credit. in addition, boom private expenditure push tax revenue. all else equal, mean substantially improve overall primary balances, well decline debt levels. prudent fiscal management lead boom private spend partly offset, even let automatic stabiliser play role.when interest rate convergence complete initial impact emu growth disappeared, underlie unsustainable fiscal policy swiftly become apparent. also, structural bottleneck arise lack competition outsized public sector excessive weight public sector economy, contribute overexpansion non-tradables sector, hamper competitiveness aggravate external imbalances.it cannot ignore that, regime change, emu major impact set expectations, transmission channel well equilibrium value key economic variables. this make extremely difficult ass development real time, cause reasonable competent people disagree best explanation, therefore advocate different policy responses.in hindsight, clear pro-cyclical fiscal policy, le demand regulatory context, complacency international financial market non-existence macroprudential policy contribute decisively accumulation significant macroeconomic imbalance portuguese economy mid-1990s.after 2008 – global crisis 2011 adjustment programmethe macroeconomic imbalance make portuguese economy extremely vulnerable international financial crisis start 2008 contagion effects. when crisis hit, follow global recession, expansionary fiscal policy adopted, time particularly intense, despite imbalance hitherto accumulate absence fiscal space. in 2010, budget deficit 11% gdp gross public debt around 100% gdp.at time, bank sector, accumulation non-performing loan result volume quality credit grant decade 2000-2010 effect financial crisis weaken banks' balance sheet increase vulnerability constraint face portuguese economy.at eu level, sovereign debt crisis euro area bring forefront failure emu economic governance, expose particular vulnerability euro area member state change markets’ sovereign risk perception. the high rise level external indebtedness (gross external debt represent 226.7% gdp end 2010), couple weak performance potential output, fuel investors’ concern portugal’s ability pay back debt. domestic bank government find increasingly difficult obtain external financing: bank turn eurosystem, whereas public debt increasingly place domestic banks.this situation ultimately result portugal’s inability fund international financial market first half 2011, 10-year yield nearly double previous year, reach 9%. recourse external official finance financial assistance programme became, again, unavoidable. the economic financial assistance programme agree may 2011 portuguese authorities, eu imf expire 30 june 2014.remarkable progress achieve 2011-2014 adjustment programme:•the budget deficit significantly decline public debt put downward trend;•private sector deleveraging ongoing; and•the bank sector robust, strong liquidity position, high solvency ratio improve asset quality.the portuguese adjustment programme widely regard success story. in view, success due three factors:•programme ownership. portugal commit programme’s implementation, urgency understand accept general public constructive dialogue social partners;•the speed intensity response tradable sector, particular exports, key rapid rebalancing external account mitigation impact low domestic demand non-tradable sector;•the preservation confidence bank sector, evidence behaviour deposits, crucial prevent economy collapse credit crunch avoid imposition capital controls.however, notwithstanding undisputed progress made, several vulnerability important challenge still remain. although level indebtedness portuguese economy asset quality credit institutions’ balance sheet evolve favourably, room complacency. it imperative ensure budgetary discipline continue deleveraging process private sector strengthen bank sector. reduce high level indebtedness, parallel create condition allow investment increase (both quantity quality), essential improve portuguese economy’s current situation. the experience past 40 year teach u thatthe initial impact assistance programme sustainable structural change foster high potential growth.a long-lasting improvement economic welfare portuguese depend crucially maintenance sustainable macroeconomic framework provide suitable incentive economic agent follow reform agenda support long-term sustainable growth.table 2 - the portuguese economy 1995-2018: some key figuressources: banco de portugal, national statistic institute, eurostat(1) non-financial private sector (2) in first column, average correspond period 1999-2007 (3) nominal. in last column average correspond 2015-2016 due data unavailability 2017-2018(4) 1999=100 5. exchange rate regime: euro potential growththe introduction euro eliminate uncertainty associate exchange rate fluctuations. in fact, one big advantage single currency neutralise “external factor” thereby contribute increase stability. yet, time, eliminate possibility recourse exchange rate instrument manage competitiveness problem even result internal factors.in fact, prior introduction euro, whenever economic side “failed”, exchange rate instrument allow (directly) competitiveness restore (indirectly) real depreciation public private debt inflation result currency devaluation. with single currency single monetary policy long possible use currency devaluation offset productivity differential real appreciation result inflation difference restore competitiveness employment give economy. it also long possible resort financial repression debt devaluation, consequent transfer wealth creditor debtors, particular public sector. excessive leverage require financial adjustment debtors, creditor penalised.the euro also eliminate anaesthetise effect exchange rate. in fact, loss exchange rate “crutch”, price wage deviation impact unemployment rate productivity deviation accelerate perception structural weakness economy need reform. therefore, single currency make need adequate policies, sound public finance financial discipline private actor visible. it require institution policy fit purpose new context. this mean that, although exchange rate stability single currency important generate favourable condition optimise economic growth, determine factors. those factor quality policy institution way resource allocate tradable non-tradable sector economy. and intrinsic exchange rate regime.in portugal, history past 25 year teach u imbalance cause combination excessive indebtedness weak potential growth.it also teach u easy access credit couple insufficient quality institution policy constrain potential growth.as i already stress above, prospect adopt euro translate increase access capital mid-1990s. however, result capital inflow misallocated, lead macroeconomic imbalances. the bank system channel foreign fund domestic residents, lead strong increase consumption investment consequent deterioration current account,without correspond expansion economy’s growth potential. indeed, investment surge finance credit expansion mainly channel towards non-tradable sectors, hamper productivity potential gdp growth. on average, period 1995-2007, gross fix capital formation non-tradable sector represent 60% total gfcf, amount 15.2% gdp.in opinion, real challenge portugal currently confront generate maintain high level employment productivity ensure last trajectory growth convergence eu partners.starting low base, portugal experience long period real convergence, 1960to mid-1990s, clear upward trend portuguese gdp per caput percentage eu15. by contrast, evidence point progress real convergence portuguese economy last 25 years, associate ongoing unfavourable development relative total factor productivity context contribution capital stock – support real convergence previous period – decline significantly.the resumption convergence process portuguese economy complex demand task, namely view challenge pose demographic trend rapid technological change. a last trajectory growth convergence towards european partner depend ability:•to promote efficient resource allocation, namely sustain maximisation investment returns, reallocation towards tradable sector;•to reach high level productivity;•to generate maintain high level employment; and•to ensure combination capital labour generate output desire value market. 6. lesson challengeslet turn major lesson i believe draw portugal’s participation emu, well challenge country monetary union.first all, speculate possible high current account deficit persist several year portugal number euro area country without financial market question countries’ ability repay increase debts.in fact, number years, dominant view academic policy circles, well financial markets, might call “benign view”. accord view, current account imbalance expect result deep integration among country different level economic development and, monetary union, current account deficit reflect financial balance private sector would cause concern. credit risk monitor would ensure adequate risk-pricing, would aggregate (and thus policy-relevant) macroeconomic imbalance.however, assumption underlie benign approach turn highly unrealistic mislead policy perspective. with benefit hindsight, clear “prudent view” warranted. over-optimistic expectation future growth prospect short-sightedness, weak domestic institution real financial friction make strong case policy intervention aim mitigate boom-bust pattern monetary integration. the buff would result low public debt strong capital bank sector would put converge economy much sound foot face financial storm. also, ambitious consistent approach structural reform would leave economy good equip face challenge globalisation ageing.in monetary union, problem potential lack foreign exchange reserve address balance payment imbalance sustainability debt various sector economy. the question arise financial capacity sector service roll debt, respond new finance needs. the reason apply member state themselves, within framework bail-out mechanism.the big challenge country enter monetary union sustainability policies. policy authority need closely monitor economic developments, read sign stand ready “sail wind”. this mean economic policy restrictive need contain excessive credit growth indebtedness private sector mounting. policy-makers must fall temptation drift along current access fund easy cheap available volume higher. above all, important policy-makers dazzle initial advantage single currency. if accompany complacent attitude, advantage become trap risk economic sustainability.7. conclude remarksin short, balance portuguese experience euro positive represent key regime change. the euro promote move towards regime characterise structurally low le volatile interest inflation rate lead important structural change portuguese economy.for eu whole, creation single currency 20 year ago pivotal moment history european integration. since then, come long way still long way go. in recent years, response difficulty arise financial crisis, profound change emu rule architecture aim make balance resilient shocks. however, emu still significant weakness remain incomplete key areas, bank union capital market union.the emu result share sovereignty member states. it construction base permanent negotiation approximation different start positions, safeguard national culture identity guarantee sense belong “group identity”. this imply institutional framework great capacity understand manage difference facilitate interaction interest whole specific parts, order ensure former great sum latter.emu also require mutual trust, responsibility solidarity go hand hand.it therefore important member state continue work together commit way complete journey start 1999 european citizen fully profit benefit common currency.the

still grow reasonably well, risksare increasingly tilt downside. the main source downside risk geopoliticaldevelopments many part world. these development create considerable uncertaintyand uncertainty cause business reconsider spend plans. this make theinternational environment challenge us.on australian economy, two main messages.the first soft patch, gentle turn point reached.while

periods, like now, growth isweaker expected.with benefit hindsight, factor help explain slow australianeconomy past year. one international development i speak earlier. while australia lessdirectly affect us–china trade dispute many countries, indirecteffect slow global growth increase global uncertainty.a second important factor weak consumption growth.over past year, growth consumption per person, unusualoutcome time employment grow strongly (graph 9). an important part theexplanation household disposable income increase slowly anextended period, reflect subdue wage increase strong growth tax paid.graph 9the persistence slow growth household income lead many people reassess fast theirincomes increase future. a do this, also reassess spending,particularly discretionary items, quite weak recent time (graph 10). notsurprisingly, spend household essential much le affected.graph 10another part explanation weak growth household spend adjustment thehousing market. a house price fallen, mark decline house turnover,with turnover rate decline low level 20 year (graph 11). withfewer u move homes, spend new furniture household appliance quite soft.so expenditure move cost real

include northern tablelands, farmer facedextremely dry conditions. indeed, indicate graph, area condition thedriest record (graph 12). reflect this, farm output australia fall past two yearsand sharp drop farm income farmer cope increasedcosts obtain fee water. these difficult condition contribute weakness inoverall household income consumption, effect particularly felt regionalcommunities. the drought also put upward pressure food price past year,particularly bread, milk meat. we hop drought break soon. graph 12© commonwealth australia 2019, australian bureau meteorology; available

at time, index tltro iii rate themain refinance operation rate deposit facility rate imply that, ecb adjustthese key interest rates, average fund condition programme would becorrespondingly adjust

policy rate entail initial price operations. in addition, maturity theoperations extend two three years, early repayment option two yearswas introduced. the adjustment tltro iii parameter signal govern councilcan act agile manner fine-tune monetary policy instruments, needed, ensurethat efficient, effective proportionate risk price stability. 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech we believe change represent significant ease banks’ medium-term fundingconditions, turn contribute improve lend condition bank offer thereal economy. the accommodative price strengthen support bank funding, sothat bank continue offer loan firm household favourable terms. the extendedmaturity tltro iii good align bank-based finance investment projects,thereby support banks’ finance real economy. finally, view lengthenedmaturity, option voluntarily repay amount borrow maturity quarterlyfrequency provide great flexibility banks’ fund plans.the two-tier systemlet turn second measure. bank euro area continue benefit thenegative interest rate policy large intermediation volume low credit risk forborrowers associate favourable macroeconomic developments. this helpedsupport bank profitability across euro area since deposit facility rate turn negative in2014. in addition, bank able generate high non-interest income thecompression yield reflect high asset valuations. banks’ fund cost wholesalemarkets also decreased, mitigate impact low rate net interest income.however, negative interest rate policy also entail cost banks, likely toincrease long negative rate place, low policy rate set large theamount excess liquidity.the govern council therefore decide introduce two-tier system reserve remunerationin order ensure accommodative monetary policy stance continue translate intofavourable lend conditions, particularly important give european economy islargely bank-based.under two-tier system, part bank’s hold excess liquidity exempt fromthe negative deposit facility rate. the size exempt part bank’s reserve account willinitially six time minimum reserve requirement. this strike balance twooutcomes. it offset direct cost negative interest rate banks’ profitability, therebyhelping sustain pass-through low policy rate bank lending. and also preserve thepositive contribution negative rate accommodative stance monetary policy thecontinued sustain convergence inflation aim.there several reason initial value choose multiplier six time bank’sminimum reserve requirement.first, provide bank relief negative rates. base current hold ofexcess liquidity, current calibration entail

(mark.deen@banque-france.fr). page 1 sur 11 lady gentlemen, it particular pleasure welcome occasion 10th anniversary chair banque de france/pse. all anniversary worthy celebration, continue partnership banque de france paris school economics particular reason cheer. over past ten years, testimony academic research economic policy make reinforce other. in past ten years, thank interaction, much do make financial environment capable rein financial excesses. thank both, introduce many new unconventional tool implement monetary policy. but change also bring new question new uncertainties, academic research needed. hence, i would like elaborate two present challenges: conduct monetary policy current economic environment, interaction monetary policy financial stability. ** 1. monetary policy face new challenge 1.1. a new environment call new response these new uncertainty arise time global economic environment become increasingly uncertain. in short term, many uncertainty obstruct economic outlook – especially manufacture sector – man-made – even one-man made. contingency long ago appear tail risks, possibility escalation trade tension disorderly brexit, become loom threats. but uncertainty also pertain long-term structural trends. over past decade, world economy steadily recover global financial page 2 sur 11 crisis. but return pre-crisis normal. interest rate remain historical lows, due historically low level natural rate interest r*ii. in short run, analysis – uncertainty first trigger present slowdown – guide rank policy answers. monetary policy play role, – le ever – game town. it even first game town. the first response would government-driven uncertainty address directly governments, remove self-induced threat world growth. fail that, second answer fiscal policy step in. fiscal stimulus country fiscal space would stimulate aggregate demand, and, targeted, quality investment, increase long-term growth.iii wage increase country long rely wage moderation could also help bolster aggregate demand inflation. and pro-growth reform would raise r*. monetary policy provide third response. for past ten years, little doubt ecb monetary policy mario draghi’s presidency make decisive contribution safeguard euro 2012, also significant recovery euro area since 2013. over period, 10 million job created. our unconventional measure estimate add almost 2 percentage point growth inflation 2016 2020. since i talk audience researcher i course emphasise number subject uncertainty. however, recent monetary policy decision govern council give rise many comments. my rule conduct add mine heat moment. two week later, let say i support many element package, include strengthen state-dependent forward guidance welcome introduction tiering system, similar jurisdiction negative interest rates. but i favour resumption net asset purchase time, i think purchase unnecessary right now, give page 3 sur 11 low level long-term interest rate term premia, continue decrease significantly since stop net purchase last december. the main purpose qe extract duration risk bond market; indeed, term premia already successfully compress – term premium 10-year ois estimate significantly negative around -60 -100 bp. i also think significant strengthen forward guidance, consequent prolongation reinvestment period important stock qe asset – 2600 billion euro –, dfr cut, already powerful consistent combination. the forward guidance state expect rate remain present levels, lower, inflation outlook robustly converge level sufficiently close to, below, 2%, convergence consistently reflect underlie inflation dynamics: forward guidance strongly “state based”, reflect enhance commitment reach objective. this significant progress overshadow argument qe. for me, question shift balance hawk dive – i never find ornithological categorisation much help design monetary policy. it question pragmatic objective economic analysis, take market expectation useful indicator dependent them. but whatever debate govern council been, let u look forward stress one simple message unanimous agreement: monetary policy has, more, do duty. it policy maker theirs, start fiscal authorities. a mario draghi point yesterday front european parliament, “we need coherent economic strategy euro area complement enhance effectiveness monetary policy”. 1.2 specific challenge monetary policy page 4 sur 11 this however call self-congratulation: homework renew research questions, cannot live old metric present lack knowledge. for that, need ever research dialogue. first, measurement key structural determinant remain surround uncertainty. i mention uncertainty surround trend r*. but similar uncertainty pertain measurement potential output natural level unemployment u*iv. we also intensively work economic effect climate change long-term significant shock, interaction monetary policy. how best measure inflation expectation second key issue. we know expectation key determinant inflation, remain unclear relevant measure inflation expectation are. expectation professional forecaster (at 1,7 %) market-based measure (at 1,3 %) receive attention now, expectation firm well household – significantly high – matter least much aggregate demand price-setting. a benoît coeuré rightly stress last july, research need expectation are, form them.v third, still much know firm household form expectation future interest rates, expectation affect spend decisions. we know standard dsge model tend assume much foresight private agents. how incorporate realistic behavior central issue, especially forecast effect new instrument forward guidancevi. to sure, uncertainty response economy policy always remain, especially firm household still learn new measure affect economy, live low negative interest rates.vii page 5 sur 11 a last topic deserves, i believe, particular attention: possible side-effects monetary tool financial stability, especially effect unconventional monetary policies. 2. monetary policy financial stability 2.1 prudential policy monetary policy complement substitute to address concern financial stability, regulation supervision, microprudential macroprudential, course available essential. on financial regulation, ten year financial crisis, must resist temptation unpick done, complacency believe “this time different”. macroprudential policy essential foster financial stability. however, macroprudential policy limits. to start with, today, toolkit much bank-centric. we make progress extend macroprudential policy beyond bank sector. but acknowledge yet become press issue non-banking sector develop reaction macrofinancial environment change regulation framework. in addition, macroprudential arsenal still rather new untested, uncertainty remain quantitative magnitude effect interventionsviii. experience teach u adapt adjust policy time, uncertainty remain feature real-world policy-making. finally, refrain hubris: time, design comprehensive macroprudential toolkit learn make best use it. but macroprudential policy certainly contribute lot, root cause financial crisis remain reach macroprudential policy alone would fall short achieve financial stability. page 6 sur 11 if prudential policy limitations, legitimate ask whether monetary policy take account financial stability concern even assist prudential policies. to sure, monetary policy drawback instrument foster financial stability. in particular, cannot target specific risks. but jeremy stein noted, bluntness tool also strength: affect financial players.ix let take step back. central bank operational independence decide mandate. the mandate give eurosystem clear: primary objective price stability. however, mandate state “shall contribute smooth conduct policy pursue competent authority relate prudential supervision credit institution stability financial system”x. careful attention dynamic indebtedness households, firms, financial intermediary would also line intellectual tradition eurosystem. since inception, ecb always give special attention broad financial aggregate set course monetary policy. it emphasise monetary pillar emphasise monetary analysis. restrict attention measure liquid liability m3 probably little justification today view little direct relevance monetary aggregate price developments. but relevance broad vary credit aggregate beyond question price financial stability concerns. together asset prices, could constitute base revise credit financial pillar.xi 2.2 the separation principle become le relevant multifaceted monetary policy the link monetary policy financial stability raise two questions. first, quantitative effect monetary policy instrument financial stability? we enough evidence interest rate policy effect indebtedness, risk-taking (through maturity transformation, page 7 sur 11 search yield, channels) profitability financial actors. it would therefore short-sighted ignore side effect monetary policy financial stability. second, effect large enough make possible preserve financial stability without compromise price stability? at point, precise term possible trade-off still debated.xii the issue complex: nuno coimbra pse emphasis paper hélène rey, decrease interest rate encourage risk-taking interest rate low, discourage interest rate high.xiii we need work important issue. let suggest two think open issue. a/ incorporate financial stability concern extend monetary toolkit first, binary opposition traditional separation principle “leaning wind’’ make le sense monetary policy several instrument disposal. a median way, could call “coordinated” “integrated” possible. indeed, several instrument allow pursue several objective old tinbergen rule asserts. this particularly relevant within monetary policy current context. over past year bring innovation operational framework, considerably extend toolkit balance-sheet policy quantitative ease (t)ltros. like time-honed interest-rate policy, balance-sheet policy introduce price-stability objective mind. but extend toolkit bring u new degree freedom, valuable think new flexibility could use long-run minimise financial stability risk without compromise price stability. let illustrate example tiering. the tiering system decide upon allow interest rate policy deliver price stability without trade financial stability. far enter conflict price stability, tiering actually also ensure policy intend page 8 sur 11 effect price stability, alleviate risk reduce pass-through policy finance cost private sector. and may enhance monetary policy stance mitigate side effect keep rate low longer. there reason commit one particular monetary instrument financial stability objective. instead, parallel public finance prove useful. it customary public finance see problem choose tax rate one minimise distortion create various tax instruments, order raise give amount revenues. similarly, possible approach monetary policy decision one choose combination instrument minimise risk financial stability, order deliver policy stance call price-stability mandate. likewise, new instrument could efficient address financial stability concerns. for instance, dimensions, balance-sheet policy differ markedly interest-rate policies. by provide valuable safe asset bank – central bank reserve – high level central bank reserve support smooth functioning. even importantly, mitigate risk bank try supply demand safe asset engineer themselves. privately issue safe asset poor substitute public safe assets.xiv b/ keep purchase private asset minimum in case – second remark – purchase private asset central bank keep minimum. indeed, asset-side balance-sheet – asset central bank buy reserve issue – matter lot. buy excessive amount private asset corporate bond could run risk distort signal asset price convey assets’ riskiness. the present compression risk premia credit spread might already increase risk financial stability. ** page 9 sur 11 conclusion i restrict remark financial stability policy fall, least part, within realm central bank. however, i emphasize earlier, monetary prudential policy policy available. due present economic environment, fiscal policy structural reform part policy mix. but also follow guide principle i highlight today: tool available, easy combine minimise trade-off price financial stabilities. fiscal policy help monetary policy foster financial stability several ways. first, course help take away burden policy accommodation. but fiscal policy also directly assist monetary policy foster financial stability. it help monetary policy provide safe asset necessary

parliament,brussels, 23 february 2019.* * *introductionmadam chair,honourable member economic monetary affair committee,ladies gentlemen,i would like start congratulate election, you, madam chair, yourrecent appointment chair committee.it pleasure appear committee new legislative term termas ecb president come end.the legitimacy ecb’s independence, enshrine eu treaties, crucially rely onour accountability. and treaty confer parliament central role holdingthe ecb accountable.hearings committee play essential role here. in time president, i foundthem extremely beneficial.when i appear econ committee first time, december 2011, euroarea rife financial instability; fall second recession, eventually ledto sustain disinflation and, times, heighten risk outright deflation. the euro area hascome long way since crisis, part thank support provide ecb’s monetarypolicy. the unemployment rate euro area 7.5% july year, low level sincejuly 2008.over past years, ecb repeatedly clearly show readiness determinationto fulfil primary objective achieve price stability, lay treaties. thisreadiness determination critical address economic crisis thedownside risk objective.it determination that, two week ago, ecb’s govern council decidedto act response continue shortfall inflation respect aim.i happy able discus decision today. i first review maindevelopments euro area economy since last appearance committee. i willthen present monetary policy decision take govern council lightof economic outlook. a request committee, i conclude draw somelessons past eight year could relevant discuss policy response tothe challenge lie ahead us.the euro area economic outlooksince last hear committee early year, euro area growth momentumhas slow markedly, previously anticipated. real gdp growth now1 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech project 1.1% 2019, 0.6 percentage point december 2018 staffprojections, 1.2% 2020, 0.5 percentage point december projections.this slowdown mainly due weakness international trade environment ofpersistent uncertainty relate protectionist policy geopolitical factors. these factorsare increasingly weigh economic sentiment and, particular, manufacture sector,which trade-oriented expose foreign influences.of course, country relatively large manufacture sector vulnerable toany turn global economic cycle. germany, example, account 28% euro areagdp, much 39% euro area manufacture value added. accordingly, germany istoday one euro area member affect slowdown.while euro area service sector continue resilient, complacent aboutits capacity remain robust negative spillovers. the long weakness manufacturingpersists, great risk sector economy affect theslowdown.looking ahead, recent data forward-looking indicator – new export order inmanufacturing – show convince sign rebound growth near future thebalance risk growth outlook remain tilt downside.in context protract weakness euro area economy, realise andprojected inflation persistently level line ecb governingcouncil’s medium-term aim.headline inflation remain well 2%, inflation exclude volatile food andenergy component hover around 1% extend period time. underlyinginflation remain muted, weak economic outlook may imply delay pass-throughof wage prices. in particular, firm absorb increase labour cost profitmargins rather pass customers. meanwhile, indicator inflationexpectations stand low levels. although likelihood deflation remain limited, marketexpectations inflation medium term settle around value consistentwith inflation aim.since last hear here, revise inflation outlook entire projectionhorizon, first march 2019 staff projection september, reflect weakereconomic activity low energy prices. inflation currently expect average 1.2% in2019, 1.0% 2020 1.5% 2021, well govern council’s medium-termaim below, close to, 2%.the ecb’s response current outlookso govern council meet two week ago, confront rapid andextended slowdown previously anticipated, persistent prominent downside risk thegrowth outlook, delay convergence inflation towards aim. a strongmonetary policy response therefore essential.in pursuit mandate, decide comprehensive package measure ensure thatinflation move towards aim sustain manner.we low interest rate deposit facility –0.40% –0.50%. this rate provide ananchor short-term market interest rates, serve reference many type ofloans financial instruments. low deposit facility rate help improve theborrowing condition household businesses. negative rate also encourage bank tolend real economy instead hold onto liquidity, thus support portfolio rebalancing 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech channel asset purchase programme (app).the impact cut deposit facility rate reinforce strengthen forwardguidance likely direction monetary policy future. specifically, clarify thatwe expect policy rate stay “at present low level see inflationoutlook robustly converge level sufficiently close to, below, 2% within projectionhorizon, convergence consistently reflect underlie inflation dynamics”.this enhance guidance provide clear signpost rate expectation link policy tomore stringent condition inflation outlook.the govern council’s statement want see inflation rise level issufficiently close to, below, 2% reassert say july monetary policymeeting: value realise project inflation see recent time low andinconsistent govern council’s medium-term inflation aim. while new formulationof forward guidance reflect characteristic forward-looking orientation ecb’s monetarypolicy framework, add two safeguard ensure policy rate normalisation onlybegins inflation sustainably course reach medium-term aim. the phrase“robustly converge” mean govern council want sure process ofconvergence sufficiently mature realistic start lift policy rates. the referenceto inflation outlook “consistently reflect underlie inflation dynamics” mean thatthe path realise inflation underpin inflation outlook.our enhance guidance help reduce uncertainty expect path interest rate inthe short medium term ensure financial condition adjust line inflationdynamics. moreover, maintain ease bias rates, indicate still havespace cut rate further, needed.we also decide restart net asset purchase monthly pace €20 billion novemberonwards. these purchase expect run long necessary reinforce theaccommodative impact policy rates, end shortly start raise keyecb interest rates. in addition, reiterate intention continue reinvesting, full, theprincipal payment mature security purchase app extend period oftime past date start increase interest rates, case long asnecessary maintain favourable liquidity condition ample degree monetaryaccommodation.the net purchase long reinvestment horizon reinforce accommodative impact ourother measures, thereby ease fund cost business household theeuro area. in addition, measure help keep longer-term interest rate mitigatingthe undue tighten would otherwise mechanically arise reduction averagematurity portfolio. finally, net purchase also signal commitment use instrumentsin pursuit price stability objective, powerful effect formation ofinflation expectations.as complement policy measure i outlined, also decide change themodalities new series target longer-term refinance operation (tltro iii) weannounced june. bank obtain long-term fund low rate longermaturity. this also help ensure accommodative policy pas entirely tothe fund cost household firms.finally, also announce two-tier system reserve remuneration, part banks’excess reserve exempt negative rates. the two-tier system design tostrike balance two outcomes: seek preserve incentive bank passthrough stimulus generate negative interest rate reserves, mitigatingthe adverse effect negative rate might banks’ lend behaviour affectingtheir profitability. the euro area need financial intermediary remain engage active 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech monetary transmission, new two-tier system make sure ability bank toextend loan customer favourable term remain unimpaired.the different element comprehensive package mutually reinforce supportingfavourable finance condition business households, sustain investmentand consumption. great business household expenditure, turn, support inflationdynamics make sure durably converge aim.overall, view outlook uncertainty facing, monetary policy need remainhighly accommodative prolong period time. the measure take last meetingunderscore determination readiness provide necessary monetary stimulus inpursuit price stability objective. we continue stand ready adjust instrumentsif warrant inflation outlook.looking back, look forwards: achievement future direction economic andmonetary unionthe conventional unconventional measure ecb take past decade havebeen successful address deflationary risks, restore function monetarypolicy transmission mechanism provide vital support euro area economy.but ecb operate vacuum economic policy matter too. allow torecall first appearance committee 2011. at time, half introductoryremarks function economic monetary union (emu) need forother european policymakers act.so i conclude final statement highlight lesson emergedfrom eight years, i hope help address challenge ahead.when compare crisis response euro area advance economies, itis evident latter able achieve good macroeconomic policy mix time,thanks decisive action fiscal financial domains.the govern council reiterate determine ensure inflation movestowards aim sustain manner, continue stand ready adjust

bereversed ambitious structural reform agenda.in words, need coherent economic strategy euro area complement andenhances effectiveness monetary policy.this unanimous consensus govern council fiscal

sustainability ensured, potentialeffectiveness countercyclical fiscal policy reinforce current environment, give 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech fiscal multiplier high low interest rate environment. at time, government incountries high public debt pursue prudent policy deliver structural balancetargets.another key difference compare advance monetary union like unite state isthe lack central

commitment hardwork everyone involved. a i argue committee eight year ago, need show “aclear trajectory future evolution” emu thus frame “expectations citizensand financial markets”.allow take longer-term perspective draw last lesson. while euro area nothave fiscal policy response comparable advance economies, ecb’sresponse fully comparable major central banks.thanks independence, ecb able adapt policy response reactionfunction. preserve key asset allow ecb adapt future circumstance andensure effectiveness measures. this important consider thedesirability relevance central bank independence increasingly challenge aroundthe world.as i argue introduction, best way preserve ecb’s independence ensure acommensurate degree central bank accountability. during past eight years,

(2011), “hearing committee economic monetary affair europeanparliament”, brussels, 19 december.see fraccaroli, n., giovannini, a. jamet, j.- f. (2018), “the evolution ecb’s accountability practicesduring crisis”, economic bulletin, issue 5, ecb.212 5 / 5bis central bankers' speech 18.09.2019 monetary policy bank profitability environment uncertainty 10th conference spanish bank sector, organise ivie university valencia pablo hernández de co governor 3/13 lady gentlemen, good morning. i like thank valencian economic research institute invitation speak conference spanish bank sector, year mark tenth anniversary. i honour delight participate event share reflection regard current profitability spanish bank main challenge shape future. a know, subject attract lot attention europe, part analyst supervisor industry itself, owe concern banks’ low profitability. before i address issue, allow start describe economic situation euro area and, particular, decision take govern council european central bank (ecb) last week. this relevant financial system, insofar context activity carry next years. 1. the economic situation euro area monetary policy response the international economic context undoubtedly become unfavourable past year, slowdown growth and, particular, trade. the late information show global activity slow across board second quarter high frequency indicator point persistence weakness come months. meanwhile, decline world trade appear steepened, background heighten uncertainty regard trade policy unite state china intensification geopolitical risks. although decline activity particularly strong manufacturing, slowdown recent month global service output pmi, remain expansionary territory, indicative increase risk great slowdown global activity. give degree openness existence certain idiosyncratic factors, euro area economy one affect international trade developments. specifically, significant slowdown euro area begin 2018, mainly due sharp moderation exports. a result, 2018, gdp grow average rate 1.8%, 0.7 percentage point le 2017, year-on-year growth fell around 1% late 2018 early 2019. the late information show euro area gdp growth second quarter, adversely affect export weakness sluggish investment, 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, 0.4% first quarter. by contrast, private consumption continue grow, drive relative strength labour market. on supply side, industrial activity contract period, service continue behave favourably. by country, decline activity german economy stagnation italy notable. furthermore, available indicator suggest weakness economic activity euro area persist third quarter year. thus, indicator relate trade industrial activity (industrial production, export orders, manufacture confidence industrial production expectations) continue deteriorate. also, certain survey indicator activity employment service show downturn, may indicate weakness begin spread activities. the slowdown employment, along 4/13 gradual decline consumer confidence third quarter, point modest growth private consumption, main driver growth. in context, ecb publish macroeconomic projection euro area whole last week. project gdp growth revise downwards, especially 2020. specifically, growth project 1.1% 2019 1.2% 2020, case low rate project june. in medium term, recovery activity expected, underpin favourable financial condition slightly expansionary fiscal policy stance, assume political trade uncertainty gradually dissipates. notwithstanding downward revision macroeconomic projections, ecb’s govern council stress remain important downside risk central scenario, arise mainly possibility no-deal brexit possible escalation trade tensions. inflation euro area remain low levels. in third quarter, inflation development mark downward dynamic energy price persistence moderate rate service industrial goods. the annual rate change harmonise index consumer price (hicp) hold steady 1% august, second month running, underlie inflation, exclude energy food prices, stand 0.9%. in fact, since 2013, inflation euro area stand average 0.9%, practically half level observe first 10 year emu, 2.1%. in parallel, indicator long-term inflation expectations, base financial market information, fall sharply since end last year stand low levels, broadly coincide signal obtain surveys. these indicator regularly use monitor degree inflation expectation anchor ecb’s medium-term inflation target (below, close to, 2%). although reduction inflation expectations, accord market indicators, seem stem fall inflation risk premium, level premium negative territory, would indicate agent hedge risk low even negative inflation rates. this absence inflationary pressure weakness demand, along expectation fall oil price deteriorate global environment, lead downward revision eurosystem inflation projections. inflation project stand 1.2% 2019 and, follow notable downward revision 0.4 percentage points, 1% 2020. in 2021, inflation expect stand 1.5%, clearly monetary policy target. these development accompany reduction long-term yield sovereign debt markets, reach historic low euro area country unite states, consequence weakness macroeconomic environment market expectation central bank response scenario reduce economic momentum. in short, macroeconomic context characterise euro area, first, downward revision growth forecasts, already relatively weak, remain subject downside risks, owe persistence trade tension geopolitical 5/13 uncertainties, relate final outcome brexit, country area even point risk imminent recession; second, medium-term inflation projection also revise downwards well level could consider compatible ecb’s price stability mandate. the measure adopt govern council ecb last week’s meet understand background. in particular, keep previous communications, govern council act – package expansionary measure – response inflation rates, realise project come years, remain persistently ecb’s aim, line commitment symmetry relation aim. in context, symmetry mean ecb undertake act determination whether inflation persistently 2%.1 in particular, govern council ecb take decision decrease interest rate deposit facility 10 basis point -0.50% reinforce forward guidance interest rate indicate remain present low level see inflation outlook robustly converge level sufficiently close to, below, 2%. such convergence also consistently reflect observe behaviour underlie inflation. the ecb also agree restart net purchase asset purchase programme (app) monthly pace €20 billion 1 november without define time limit. in order preserve favourable bank lend conditions, modality new series quarterly target longer-term refinance operation (tltro iii) also changed, eliminate 10 bp spread establish interest rate apply extend maturity two three years. finally, order support bank-based transmission monetary policy, two-tier system reserve remuneration announced, part banks’ hold excess liquidity exempt negative deposit facility rate. these decision aim counter worsen growth inflation outlook mean package measure complement one another, ease financial condition different route. thus, cut interest rate deposit facility moderate effect yield short end different yield curves, extend interest rate term structure whole, thus reduce cost borrow household firms. this effect reinforce change introduce forward guidance interest rates, closely link potential normalisation interest rate robust convergence inflation outlook level “sufficiently close to, below, 2%”. moreover, convergence reflected, mention earlier, actual inflation dynamics. this forward guidance interest rate resumption net asset purchase seek impact medium longer-dated segment yield curve, mainly interest rate expectation case forward guidance, term risk premia case asset purchases. the resumption net purchases, without define time 1see governor banco de españa’s close address la granda course 31 august 2019, “the european economic policy response scenario low growth inflation”. 6/13 limit, also important signal effect respect govern council’s commitment meet inflation aim, particularly relevant current context inflation expectation risk become de-anchored. in addition, period time net asset purchase reinvestment exist asset continue anchor normalisation interest rates, thus enhance consistency complementarity different measure dynamic adjustment inflation. in set heighten uncertainty, automatic adjustment expectation future path monetary policy face potential change macroeconomic environment particularly desirable. lastly, improve condition new tltro-iii programme seek ease condition bank lend real economy. economic research, include produce banco de españa recent years, show measure effective recent past, term ease financial condition encourage lending. bear mind, new package measure boost economic activity euro area background high uncertainty help bring convergence inflation level line ecb's mandate. a regard negative interest rates, although conclusive evidence date adversely affect supply bank credit, cannot rule maintain rate low level additional, potentially extended, period time, could ultimately negative consequence bank-based transmission monetary policy. in regard, mitigate measure adopt ecb, consist tiered system remunerate excess liquidity holdings, intend soften negative impact bank profitability new reduction reserve remuneration, thus ensure expansionary effect activity inflation additional cut interest rate current setting. 2. bank sector profitability this economic environment banks, economic agent and, particular, financial institution face come years. if i may, i move analyse development spanish bank sector profitability determinant thereof. profitability one main variable characterise financial position bank provide first line defence adverse shocks. indeed, volume bank’s profit determine return owner earn capital invested. this, duly adjust risk assumed, affect bank’s valuation. moreover, profit level determine margin agent available address shocks. indeed, low profitability reduce possibility generate capital internally retain earnings. note capital bank act buff allow potential loss absorb adverse scenarios, intermediary continue offer financial service household firms, thus contribute smooth – rather amplify – negative shock economy. also, high level capital entail strong link personal wealth owner economic performance banks, thus contribute mitigate risk profile 7/13 latter prepare assume and, therefore, likelihood overreach subsequently require traumatic correction measures. all explain concern bank regulator bank hold sufficient capital. the last financial crisis show banks’ capital level clearly insufficient address economic financial shock arose. in response crisis, international financial regulator tighten capital requirements, set high minimum level require capital high quality, well introduce requirement minimum liquidity levels. a result, main international bank system gradually raise solvency ratio recent years. the spanish bank system gradually adapt new regulation capital ratio currently excess regulatory requirements. however, case ratio calculate term risk-weighted assets, cet1 ratio, average level comparatively low rise le main european bank systems. by contrast, term leverage ratio, is, banks’ asset risk-weighted, relative position spanish bank system favourable, stand somewhat european average main european bank systems. spanish bank profitability since start crisis the profitability spanish bank system contract sharply last economic crisis severely jurisdictions: 2012 return equity reach negative level -21% return asset negative level -1.2%, accord consolidate statement information reflect business spain also international exposures. the main determinant performance increase loan loss associate significant increase non-performing loans, particular construction real estate sector bank over-exposed. despite drop aggregate profit level first half year, recent year profitability spanish bank system tend recover, essentially underpin decline impairment loss reflect improvement quality credit portfolio. the reduction non-productive asset – non-performing loan foreclose asset – play fundamental part. specifically, ratio non-performing loan resident private sector spain fall 14% december 2013 5.3% june 2019, volume foreclose asset decrease almost €78 billion december 2013 €40 billion june 2019. this achieve sale large non-performing foreclose asset portfolios, partly consequence regulatory supervisory pressure. these late development occur favourable macro-financial set characterise grow economic activity, fall unemployment low interest rates. this boost borrowers’ ability repay loans, drive asset value also compatible substantial deleveraging non-financial private sector major consolidation process bank sector. 8/13 spanish bank system earn highly cyclical, essentially account business spain. bank expose business abroad comparatively le hard hit crisis, able offset loss spanish business earn activity economy le adversely affect cyclical patterns. naturally, international exposure also entail risks. for example, bank exposure unite kingdom could affect possible negative impact brexit effect may uk economy. in addition, problem face certain emerge market economies, turkey argentina, may affect bank exposure countries. however, despite risks, international diversification bank business offer important advantage overall especially, apparent last crisis, focus retail bank organise decentralise basis. despite recent recovery observe spanish bank system profitability, present level pre-crisis level cost capital estimate available. this situation exclusive spain, fact quite widespread within euro area. indeed, average profitability spanish bank currently somewhat high main european bank system euro area average. the breakdown return asset show main reason spanish banks’ profit level high euro area average net interest income higher. this reflect large relative share spanish bank business le mature markets, latin american economies, margin higher. conversely, spanish bank high impairment relate expense provision euro area peers. average return equity among spanish bank also high bank european country switzerland unite kingdom japanese banks. but low average return equity observe profitable bank systems, unite states, sweden, norway, canada australia. in event, high level dispersion profitability banks, spain rest europe. this show profitability problem affect sector evenly, give range bank business models, country within jurisdiction, also combination multiple explanatory factors. to facilitate good understand factor underpin spanish bank system’s low profitability level compare pre-crisis levels, i concentrate business spain. this change profitability consolidate statement influence grow share international exposure observe recent year make difficult interpret earn affect significant change composition. also, small number bank significant international exposure, mean change draw consolidate statement may representative majority bank sector. the profitability data draw individual statement business spain also highly cyclical, even draw consolidate statements. this reflect great severity crisis spain compare situation economy 9/13 spanish bank hold exposures. there also sign mark recovery recent years, despite which, 2018 roe roa still pre-crisis levels. the breakdown return asset show main determinant current low level profitability business spain compare pre-crisis period narrow net interest income term assets, net interest margin. this narrow concentrate period 2009 2013, margin fell 1.4% 0.9%; since indicator steady around 1% total assets. there several factor may explain decline net interest margin observe period. first, result increase relative share non-productive assets, is, asset earn interest, non-performing loan foreclose assets. in addition, period saw severe contraction banks’ credit portfolios, reflection sharp correction high indebtedness accumulate spanish household firm pre-crisis years, loss share bank system finance economy. bank cushion balance sheet effect contraction credit portfolio increase exposure assets, especially government debt purchases. a debt security provide low return lend household firms, long run portfolio rebalancing result fall average return assets. however, sovereign debt crisis come end, increase value debt security provide positive, albeit short-lived, boost profitability. on estimates, overall effect change asset composition – associate increase non-performing loan decrease relative share credit balance sheet – would explain 70% decline net interest margin spanish bank system 2007 2018. the fall market interest rate also play part narrow net interest margin, since cost liabilities, especially deposits, main source fund spanish banks, tend le sensitive change market return remuneration assets. this effect heighten interest rate move close cero, since level serve low bind cost deposits. the reason downward stickiness cost deposit negative interest rate instrument could reduce supply funds, especially case households, would prefer hold cash, zero negative remuneration, rather deposits. an analysis average loan-deposit gap case outstanding balance show effect historically positive relationship variable level market interest rates. nevertheless, fact since 12-month euribor turn negative february 2016 loan-deposit gap narrow fact widen quite striking. there two reason this. the first average remuneration loan sustain recent year decline non-performing loans, reduce proportion loan earn interest. the second reason february 2016 still margin decline cost deposits, average 0.35% outstanding balance 0.20% new business. a result, since date deposit rate new business fall similar amount average remuneration loans. now, 10/13 however, cost deposit come close zero, would difficult pas decrease remuneration asset cost deposits. it often argue banks’ net interest income adversely affect low level interest rate also flatten yield curve observe recent years. this effect depends, first, extent positive difference maturity asset liability banks. in general, financial intermediary receive short-term fund provide long-term financing; know maturity transformation. however, order flatten yield curve negative impact net interest income, addition maturity transformation, bank need grant fixed-rate loans. if lend variable interest rates, remuneration usually link short-term yields, thus contribute hold loan-deposit gap steady. in case spain, although bank operate maturity transformation, bulk long-term lend variable rate. in consequence, flatten yield curve recent year le impact spanish banks’ net interest income net interest income bank european jurisdiction germany france fixed-rate loan predominate. in event, order ass overall effect interest rate profitability banks, necessary take account interest rate impact net interest margin also impact item income statement. in particular, low interest rate level help lessen loss credit portfolio due favourable effect borrowers’ repayment capacity associate low cost credit, high income low unemployment tie macroeconomic impact low interest rates. these effect may particularly important country like spain bank system start high level non-performing loan short-term variable rate lend prevalent, since result movement market return pass rapidly cost outstanding debt2. thus, part fall non-performing loan ratio recent year explain effect. furthermore, decline interest rate contribute increase price financial real assets. this effect immediate fixed-income securities, particularly long-term one since price sensitive change yields. valuation equity real assets, housing, also boost fall interest rate due effect discount factor, although price asset influence condition factor macroeconomic expectations. all entail capital gain bank expose financial real assets, time increase value loan collateral. this also favour improvement credit quality loan and, therefore, small loss credit portfolio. it true, event, capital gain dry interest rate stop fall remain low levels. furthermore, also evidence that, since ecb’s deposit 2 see, banco de españa (2018): annual report 2017, chapter 2, “the challenge face spanish bank sector” banco de españa (2017): annual report 2016, chapter 1, overview, box 1.3. 11/13 facility rate stand zero, negative surprise short-term interest rate accompany decline european banks’ stock prices.3 give endogenous nature monetary policy response project economic developments, change banks’ stock price due monetary surprise may reflect, one hand, negative impact le favourable projection future macroeconomic set and, other, market view direct negative effect additional interest rate cut future profitability bank backdrop protract negative rates.4 in recent years, spanish bank partially cushion fall net interest income generate income and, particular, increase fee commission income. noteworthy among fee relative increase fee sell product investment funds, backdrop grow demand assets, bolster household seek profitable investment deposit give low returns. these development result ratio gross income assets, include fee addition net interest income, fall less extent net interest margin. bank also make huge effort reduce operate expense branch closure job cuts, date expense decline moderately gross income. this reflect continue increase ratio two magnitudes, is, efficiency ratio, 2017, underline deterioration efficiency period. this trend seem come halt 2018 ratio improve slightly. in term assets, 2018 operate expense similar level pre-crisis ones. however, set share credit asset currently significantly low then, expense also small give cost associate management non-credit asset lower. the information consolidate statement also show recent level efficiency ratio pre-crisis ones, therefore indicate situation low efficiency. however, despite deterioration, ratio spanish bank system area continue favourable main european bank system also bank unite state japan, although bad scandinavian countries. main challenge affect future profitability spanish bank next, i shall briefly mention main challenge face spanish bank affect future profitability outlook. these challenge confine spanish bank system largely share jurisdictions. one major challenge bank must face link technological change. new technology represent threat opportunity banks. on one hand, promote emergence new competitors, fintechs big techs. the latter pose 3 see ampudia van den heuvel (2018). 4 recent literature monetary surprise distinguish purely monetary surprise surprise disclose private information future state economy. see, example, jaroncinski karadi (2018). 12/13 obvious disruption, give large size advantage term availability information, key asset digital financial worlds. some company already begin offer specific financial service traditionally provide bank announce intend shortly. yet hand, adopt technological innovation may also mean efficiency improvement banks, although true short term adapt new way provide financial service manage asset entail hefty cost establish banks. for society whole, use new technology finance may mean significant advantage term cost save financial inclusion. a regulators, promote adoption innovation continue treat participant symmetrically regulation govern activity comparable, irrespective type company provide services. a i mention earlier, decrease non-productive asset one main factor contribute return profitability spanish bank system recent years. nevertheless, although decrease significantly, share asset banks’ balance sheet continue historically high and, consequently, bank take advantage point cycle make progress area. another important challenge spanish bank relate need achieve reputational improvements. after economic crisis, litigation increase notably, result sizeable cost bank negative effect profitability. this increase legal cost confine spanish bank system also observe jurisdictions. in addition impact profitability high legal costs, situation accompany reputational deterioration which, reversed, may lead loss business medium term. this particularly significant set present one emergence new competitor describe above. consequently, essential sector recover customers’ trust soon possible, key asset financial business. also, spanish bank complete adaptation new international regulatory supervisory framework. a indicated, although capital ratio minimum requirement area solvency, spanish bank system still remain european country case high quality ratio (cet1). strengthen capital would lead great resilience adverse shock would also bring issuance costs.5 in addition, high solvency would help facilitate compliance mrel requirement (minimum requirement fund eligible liabilities) spanish bank gradually meet come years. it considerable challenge small bank comply requirement since usually obtain fund regularly tap capital markets. lastly, another significant challenge associate climate change transition towards sustainable economy which, although affect economic agents, particular impact financial sector. bank face two type risk 5 see financial stability report, spring 2019, banco de españa. 13/13 area: “physical risks” link direct effect climate change asset value “transition” risk connect process technological regulatory transition sustainable economy. identifying, quantify mitigate risk require considerable effort come years, although notable development green sustainable financial market spain recent year underlined. conclusion i shall conclude speech emphasise two main idea regard role economic policy current situation economic uncertainty importance address challenge face bank sector. during speech i endeavour show monetary policy continue effective support economic activity and, consequently, inflation. however, necessary underline cannot lever stimulus. accordingly, imperative national european authority undertake structural reform improve efficiency main product factor market increase euro area’s growth potential. likewise, give worsen growth projections, fiscal policy need provide great stimulus economic growth scope so. it even important european political authority ass suitability deploy euro-area wide budgetary instrument macroeconomic stabilisation, would contribute mitigate one main limitation original design common currency. all (monetary, fiscal structural) policy may especially effective adopt jointly, thus harness positive complementarity exist them. a i discuss begin speech, profitability direct indirect effect spanish bank sector’s resilience adverse shock and, therefore, extent intermediary contribute amplify smooth impact shock economy. consequently, essential spanish bank address challenge mark profitability future, technological change, reduction non-productive assets, strengthen capital improvement reputation. thank attention. i honor today, inaugurate open new raiffeisen bank head office. your investment

orthodox, rely heavily importance flexible exchange rate regime capital account openness, conjunction consistent monetary fiscal policy framework, sound bank regulation supervision. however, important remind public come long way. in fact, nearly 40 year ago, chile face one world’s costly financial crisis precisely lack several elements. in particular, fx exposure heavily leverage unsupervised bank sector contribute spread bank crisis fix exchange rate regime collapse early 1980s. a result experience, bank regulation supervision substantially upgraded. in 1986, general bank law introduce limitation currency mismatch, constraint relate party lending, restriction bank receive good instead liquid resources; them, element common practice 1982 crisis. paradoxically, could consider harsh regulation hamper financial deepening. instead, foster solvency credibility bank system allow healthy development ensue decades. at core development creation fund pension system, subsequent capital market reforms, together capital market openness, dramatically change size, composition, depth, strength financial sector chile. now, transition toward fully implement current policy framework, chile experience period capital control highly review literature. the unremunerated reserve requirement (urr) implement chile 1990s help change composition capital flow toward long term le effective term reduce aggregate level capital flow country. after remove urr completely end 90 allow exchange rate fluctuate freely, bank corporate sector learn operate completely different environment, characterize

bank must conductproper kyc processes, especially source fund ongoing monitor ofsuspicious fund flow anti-money launder / counter-terrorist finance purposes. second, private bank must understand risk appetite/tolerance level clientson one hand conduct proper product due diligence market clients. if hong kong wish remain prefer centre private wealth management, wemust strive strike right balance need accord appropriate investorprotection allow bank provide user-friendly efficient service clients. tosucceed endeavour, regulator must work close collaboration industryto continue adapt rule

articulate risk problem seek toaddress industry consider proper risk management could achievedwithout over-interpreting regulation impose rigid process drive awaycustomers. soft power12. at end day, premier ifc must posse superior soft power wish tosustain position. soft power sum wide range tangible marketinfrastructure intangible strengths. while must robust market-friendlyregulatory regime,

creature “pure” risk management hub asopposed ifc. in words, hard contemplate place turn riskmanagement hub money capital flow it. 15. finally, let share couple takeaway i say today hongkong enhance competitive position leadership risk management: (a)financial institution must put interest clients. theprofessionalism integrity financial institution practitioner crucialin earn confidence trust customers. without trust, theprospects hong kong ifc doomed. (b)financial firm avoid get carry away boom times. motivate big andgrowing profit bonuses, many financial firm mind undertake rapidexpansion without build necessary risk management capability. excessive risktaking overly aggressive expansion usually lead rather unhappy endings, thefinancial history litter many failure cases. (c)as regulators, stay true risk-based approach rightsense proportionality adopt open mind risk beaddressed. the regulator stand ready discus industry see ifthere alternative way deal risk identified. the industry alwayscloser market client serve therefore bettersense get thing do way would cause le disruption orinconvenience. (d)the regulator must fall trap complacency, constantly stay onalert maintain sense unease even good peaceful times. bank andfinancial crisis never avoid together, least build sufficientbuffers low chance occurrence happen, damage bereduced contained. (e)the industry stand ready challenge regulator severity risk isoverstated good alternative put table. on theother hand, industry must avoid over-interpreting gold plat regulators’requirements way safe compliance point view wouldcreate bad customer experience without enhance underlie risk managementoutcomes.16. all all, financial industry seek collaborate regulators, aspartners adversaries, develop risk management framework practice thatare suit hong kong’s circumstance needs. there one-size-fits-allsolution risk management hong kong must find path success learningfrom best practice elsewhere strive upgrade continuous basis. finally,may i wish fruitful productive time today’s treasury market summit! thank you. 4 / 4bis central bankers' speech natasha ahmetaj: launch new albanian

environment, central bank across world face anew challenge – inflation low, run consistently inflation targets. this hasprompted need reduce policy rate stimulate spend demand. however,given low interest rate start levels, major central bank implementnegative interest rate and/or directly buy asset (increasing balance sheets) freeup cash economy.understanding inflationary pressure ease much important help u tocalibrate policy actions. a often case, appear many reason wemust balance.the low inflation pressure part due slowdown global economic growth, regularcyclical event central bank well practice respond to. but also structuralfactors dampen inflation pressure and/or alter impact low interest rate oninvestment spending.some example structural change include change nature produce goodsand services, reliance global technology often deliver handful ofglobal supplier single global prices. we also produce services, rather thanphysical good proportion total output, reduce relative reliance capital equipmentand reduce sensitivity cost investment. production location also mobile, andlabour highly mobile internationally, make wage bargain hard even domesticlabour shortages. and, population ageing, people live longer, lead differentpreferences save rather consume.by definition, structural factor slow moving, mean anchor historicallylow interest rate time come. meanwhile, central bank continue vary policyrates response cyclical factors, rate vary low average, possibly withina low range past.in new zealand, example, believe neutral interest rate – ocr neithercontractionary expansionary economy – drift low recent decades. this isfrom mid-point estimate around 5 percent early 2000s, around 3 percent today, withplenty uncertainty around mid-points.the obvious challenge many central banks, include us, decline neutral ratemeans le room manoeuvre policy interest rate without concern zeroper cent low bound. what happen hit zero? should ocr go negative, and/or shouldwe embark direct asset purchase programme, monetary policy strategy 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech could implemented?we currently think hard questions, make sense aprecaution – it’s

affect balance sheets, pose broad risk financial stability fromsignificant prolong climate-related events.so far, i explain direct, physical risk pose climate change economy andfinancial industry. however, climate changing. the change behaviour ofeconomic agent also give rise significant transition risks. a world becomesincreasingly concern reduce global carbon footprint, governments, business andconsumers push transition sustainable, green economy. a thishappens, sector economy may face decline demand, big shift asset value orhigher cost business. for instance, governments’ action enforce paris 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech agreement could see vast majority world’s prove fossil fuel reserve leave theground. this implication value investment energy companies, particularlythose deal oil, gas coal.for many emerge market economies, transition towards sustainability also invite policyconflicts. for example, national goal reduce fossil fuel use may entail significant trade-offswith growth poverty reduction objectives, least short- medium-term. thesechallenges intensify broad environmental, social governance (esg)considerations. achieve sustainable growth development amidst capacity fundingconstraints present significant challenge political leadership, economic priority andsocial outcomes. under circumstances, high cost transition likely mean alonger time need transition towards sustainable growth policies, keepingin mind may expense heighten physical risk result delay action.this remain difficult balance require careful well-informed assessments, policycoordination, plan communication.a real example, close home, palm oil. a know, many global communityhave express concern environmental impact palm oil industry, whichaccounts 7% malaysia’s gross exports. regardless

toensure transition orderly sustained.how work towards build climate resiliencehaving establish – i hope – clear case action, let address worktowards build climate resilience together. the bank identify several key priorities.first, develop tool capacity identify climate risk relevant financialbusiness. climate change science complex multivariate. get grip issue suchas weather patterns,

affect business finda common language discus meaningful way. to end, bank securitiescommission malaysia, collaborate world bank develop principles-basedtaxonomy enable financial institution malaysia classify green asset consistently. thisframework aim support inform decision analysis exposure climate risk fundraising, lend investment activities. the bank expect issue first draft thetaxonomy end year industry feedback prior adoption.second, need develop complete understand impact climate-related risk malaysian financial system economy. in regard, bank activelyinvolved work together central bank supervisor network green thefinancial system (ngfs) develop analytical framework ass risks. this entailssizing impact climate change financial system economy, centralcase tail-end scenarios. this exercise also aim estimate relevant time frame inwhich risk may materialise. to so, would need good understand thetransmission channel climate-related risks, take consideration potential

sector-specific approach also need converge limit risk adisorderly transition. this share responsibility require u come together supportjoint coordinate response clear present threat growth financial

expect reshape financial sector, business model bank structures. this paradigm change pose significant challenge bank well regulators. one important challenge ‘compliance’; important aspect sustainable success story bank financial system. i go share think aspect today. compliance define act follow laws, rules, regulations, various code conduct include voluntary ones. although arise external requirements, follow organization’s internal rules, policies, procedures, act accordance ethical practice equally important. a strong compliance culture also ensure adherence fair practice codes, manage conflict interests, treat customer fairly, large objective deliver efficient customer service. thus, compliance shall go beyond legally bind embrace broad standard integrity ethical

integrity breach (corruption data system affect integrity information process methods). compliance risk relate breach gain significance need address priority. minimum supervisory expectation compliance culture compliance start top. it may recall that, february 2019, i draw attention ceo select banks, wherein board director along senior management urge set tone top usher strong compliance culture banks. compliance integral part culture organisation; responsibility staff work compliance function. it share responsibility staff member bank, business unit bank equally responsible non-compliance. a bank hold high standard carry business, time strive observe spirit well letter law. failure consider impact action shareholders, customers, employee market may result significant adverse publicity reputational damage, even law broken. strong compliance culture pre-requisite effective compliance function. if may delve it, robust compliance culture follow essential elements-

kuroda governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction it great pleasure opportunity today exchange view distinguish gather business leader kansai region. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation various activity bank japan's branch osaka, kobe, kyoto. at monetary policy meet (mpm) hold last week, bank, regard price development japan, judge become necessary pay close attention possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent lost. the bank also make clear policy statement that, take situation account, reexamine economic price development next mpm, compile outlook economic activity price (outlook report). today, i would like talk bank's view regard economic price development judgment base explain basic think behind conduct monetary policy. i. economic development home abroad let start talk development overseas economies. overseas economy grow moderately whole, pace continue decelerate since start year (chart 1). accord world economic outlook (weo) update release international monetary fund (imf) july, growth forecast 3.2 percent 2019 year-on-year basis, mark decline previous year's figure 3.6 percent. growth world trade volume decelerate clearly, mainly background increase prolong u.s.-china trade friction adjustment it-related goods. the diffusion index (dis) business sentiment manufacture firm global basis remain 50 since may, borderline improvement deterioration business condition perceive firms. look development major regions, u.s. economy continue expand moderately, support primarily increase private consumption. on hand, chinese european economy continue somewhat weak. specifically, manufacture sector china remain weak, mainly due effect additional tariff impose unite state authorities' measure push forward 2 deleveraging. a europe, production decline since second half last year, mainly germany, partly reflect tighten gas emission regulation automobile within european union (eu), weak export china also exert downward pressure european economy. look japan's economy, export -- mainly capital good relate business fix investment china well ny asean economy -- relatively weak since turn year, affect slowdown overseas economy (chart 2). in addition, weakness export relate production lead manufacture firm cautious sentiment. on point, since kansai region, particular, strong economic relationship asian economies, china, may feel developments. that said, domestic demand remain firm. thus far, effect slowdown overseas economy seem exert domestic demand (chart 3). business fix investment continue increase trend, corporate profit stay high level whole. accord financial statement statistic corporation industry, quarterly (fssc), ratio current profit sale industry enterprise remain historically high level. in situation, business fix investment gdp basis maintain uptrend, positive april-june quarter quarter-on-quarter basis. turn household sector, private consumption increase moderately, albeit fluctuations. this mainly attributable continue improvement employment income situation (chart 4). the active job openings-to-applicants ratio high level exceed peak mark bubble period, unemployment rate range 2.0-2.5 percent, remain around low level observe bubble period. while labor market condition remain tight, employee income increasing. japan's economy thus moderate expand trend, virtuous cycle income spend continue operate corporate household sectors, although export show weakness. 3 with regard outlook, japan's economy likely continue moderate expand trend, despite affect slowdown overseas economy time being. the key outlook following: (1) time pick-up overseas economy (2) whether firmness domestic demand sustain happens. i would like talk sustainability domestic demand. private consumption expect continue increase moderately employment income situation continue improve. although impact schedule consumption tax hike warrant attention, likely marginal compare previous tax hike 2014, mainly increase household burden small various measure smooth demand prior tax hike implemented. in addition, government spend expect underpin economic activity go forward, mainly back increase public investment accompany policy measure national resilience spend host olympic paralympic games. the sustainability domestic demand depend business fix investment. business fix investment steady despite slowdown overseas economies, likely attributable increase investment relatively le susceptible change overseas demand business cycle, include aim improve efficiency save labor order deal labor shortage, research development (r&d) growth areas, relate urban redevelopment projects. in fact, kansai region, increase see wide range medium- long-term strategic investment, r&d investment life science, theme world expo hold osaka, kansai, investment relate digitalization automobile use 5g network. also, redevelopment project osaka get underway area kita (or "the north") minami (or "the south"). with regard outlook, business fix investment expect increase moderately back high level corporate profit highly stimulative financial conditions. thus, say sustainability domestic demand japan substantially high. however, business household sentiment could affected, depend development overseas economy financial markets. in particular, slowdown overseas economy last long 4 expected, necessary pay attention possibility firms' investment stance become cautious, mainly manufacture sector. next, i would like explain key point, outlook overseas economies. although likely slowdown continue observe time being, growth rate project rise somewhat thereafter, partly back materialization effect fiscal monetary policy economy progress global adjustment it-related goods. thus, overseas economy expect grow moderately whole. a now, overseas economy project pick second half 2019 2020, line projection make imf. on point, adjustment it-related good seem move phase continue deterioration, clear sign global economy turn pick-up. under circumstances, downside risk concern overseas economy seem increase (chart 5). since unite state china increase incrementally number good subject additional tariffs, trade friction economy appear increase become prolonged. they exhibit stance continue negotiations, future development continue warrant attention. in addition trade friction, uncertainty concern overseas economy include various factor consequence negotiation unite kingdom's exit eu, effect stimulus measure china, geopolitical risk middle east. uncertainty surround development emerge economy also concern. thus, situation downside risk concern overseas economy seem increasing, necessary bear mind possibility pick-up lag behind long expected. the bank judge become necessary closely examine whether overseas economy pick aforementioned firmness domestic demand maintained. ii. price development japan let move price developments. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) around 0.5 percent (chart 6). it relatively weak compare economic expansion tight labor market conditions. while various reason this, seem affect largely fact mindset 5 behavior base assumption wage price increase easily deeply entrench japan, due experience prolong low growth deflation. thus, take time firms' cautious wage- price-setting stance, well households' cautiousness toward price rises, change. however, basic mechanism continue operate positive output gap -- rise level economic activity -- result moderate increase wage prices. let elaborate point. a i mention earlier, situation economy expand moderately labor market condition remain tight, wage employee continue rise base pay increase achieve sixth consecutive year. on hand, firm face upward pressure personnel expense distribution cost price result increase economic activity. in situation, move raise sell price spread gradually among firm (chart 7). regard output price di tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), situation continue seven consecutive quarter proportion enterprise answer output price rise exceed proportion answer price fallen. this already last long period observe bubble period. firms' stance steadily shift toward raise prices. in addition, look annual price change across cpi items, share price-increasing item minus share price-decreasing item recently increase moderately. of course, reason firm raise sell price households' tolerance price rise increasing, albeit moderately, back improvement employment income situation. such improvement achieve especially economy expand moderately positive output gap maintained. a outlook, likely japan's economy continue expand trend output gap remain positive. with level economic activity remain high, firms' stance expect gradually shift toward raise wage price medium- long-term inflation expectation firm households, le unchanged recently, project rise gradually. under circumstances, 6 year-on-year rate change cpi likely increase gradually toward 2 percent, although take time. regard baseline scenario outlook prices, however, risk skew downside. in particular, recently, slowdown overseas economy continue observe downside risk seem increasing. thus, necessary pay close attention risk economic slowdown stem overseas economy spread prices. i elaborate point late i talk bank's think behind conduct monetary policy. iii. the bank's conduct monetary policy now, i would like talk bank's conduct monetary policy. the bank pursue powerful monetary ease framework "quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control," aim achieve price stability target 2 percent (chart 8). the main transmission mechanism monetary ease bank assume low real interest rates, calculate subtract inflation expectation nominal interest rates. real interest rate currently well natural rate interest, neutral economic conditions, stimulate wide range economic activities. in situation, inflation mechanism drive positive output gap operating, i mention earlier. in order achieve price stability target, bank consider important ensure inflation mechanism continue operate thereby maintain momentum toward achieve target. this stance monetary policy conduct bank basically change year ago, i speak meet last time. on hand, monetary policy conduct major central bank abroad change significantly last year's move toward normalization. this month, european central bank (ecb) decide low one policy rate restart asset purchases, federal reserve also decide low policy rate, follow rate cut july. factor lie behind decision prolong slowdown global economy heighten uncertainties, japan 7 also facing. at press conference decision take monetary ease measures, president draghi ecb underline that, environment prolong uncertainty relate to, example, geopolitical factor rise threat protectionism, international trade weaken downside risk surround euro area economy significant. the bank japan policy stance, prevent insure risk take consideration conduct monetary policy. in so, essential bank assessment momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent. if great possibility momentum lost, bank hesitate take additional ease measures. while various factor consider examine momentum toward achieve price stability target, follow two point particularly important. first whether positive output gap, high level economic activity, maintained, whether firms' stance shift toward raise wage price situation. second development medium- long-term inflation expectation firm households. base points, bank deem momentum toward achieve price stability target maintain far. with output gap remain positive, move raise sell price reflect cost increase observe recently wide range firms. a outlook, inflation expectation project rise many factor delay inflation resolve gradually move raise price spread widely. under circumstances, year-on-year rate change cpi likely increase gradually toward 2 percent. thus, bank judge appropriate continue current monetary policy. however, give slowdown overseas economy continue observe downside risk seem increasing, become necessary pay close attention possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target lost. development output gap warrant particular attention. if downside risk overseas economy materialize, possibility growth rate japan's economy decelerate substantially through, example, prolong weak export firms' investment stance become cautious. if happens, momentum toward achieve 8 price stability target could affect shrinkage output gap. attention also pay fact impact so-called adaptive formation mechanism large japan, actual inflation rate affect inflation expectations. although crude oil price temporarily rise somewhat due increase geopolitical risks, decline extent somewhat longer-term perspective, mainly background slowdown overseas economies. if crude oil price decline actual inflation rate decrease clearly, inflation expectation also may affected. consider become necessary pay close attention possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target lost, bank thoroughly reexamine economic price development next mpm, release outlook report. it examine economic price development broad perspective next mpm, base observation available time meeting, various economic indicators, report meet general manager bank's branches, development financial markets. recently, situation change rapidly, investors' risk aversion abate somewhat due expectation progress u.s.-china trade negotiations. let also add bank preconception point regard outcome examination. before close speech, i would like elaborate bank's basic think current conduct monetary policy. there three points. first, bank's conduct monetary policy continue base current framework "qqe yield curve control," highly sustainable enable bank make flexible adjustment accord development

conference dedicate colleague central bank kuwait (cbk) effort organize conference. the bank industry enjoy exceptional growth past half century, despite shortcomings, play critical role support economic growth around world. during normal times, one would expect bank continue operate past, perhaps great focus product innovation operational efficiency. but live normal times. today, global bank industry major inflection point, face several internal external challenge come * keynote speech deliver h.e. dr. mohammad y. al-hashel, governor, central bank kuwait cbk international bank conference: shape future, september 23rd 2019, four season hotel, kuwait city – kuwait. - 2 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع together create perfect storm. certainly, industry able weather storm hold course pursue decades. rather must reinvent future. that cbk organize event theme ‘shaping future’. we believe stakeholder bank industry need take proactive role shape way bank operate future, rather continue along well-trodden path, matter well path previously serve them. take opportunity, i would like share think vision evolution bank industry. i begin brief overview major challenge industry face today. second, i reflect key area bank need focus order stay relevant. finally, i touch upon role enable stakeholder need play support bank industry transformative journey. 1-challenging operate environment so, let start brief discussion key challenge bank industry face today. three challenge particularly worth highlighting: state global economy; revolution financial technology; rapidly evolve need expectation customers. i. global economy first, let u look global economy headwind intensifying. the imf twice low global growth projection 2019 3.2%, develop economy expect grow much slow rate 1.9%1. a key driver slowdown economic uncertainty bring rise trade tension protectionist policies. if trade tension continue, imf may - 3 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع revise economic growth projections. the bank england estimate 10% increase tariff u trade partner could lead reduction 2.5% u gdp, 1% global gdp exclude us.2 in recent publication, institute international finance (iif) also highlight economic policy uncertainty key risk business sentiment. the iif estimate economic policy uncertainty u china record high, impact felt term reduce investment low consumption.3 we already see impact trade dispute attendant economic uncertainty market across globe. prominent index dow jones industrial average, s&p 500, nasdaq composite, ftse 100 nikkei 225 decline average around 7% mid-august, high july. another factor link economic outlook role monetary policy. economic growth last decade mainly drive use unconventional monetary policies. while policy support economic recovery follow global financial crisis, ensure low interest rate environment, lead unintended consequence like fuel debt level across globe. thank low interest rates, global debt balloon $246 trillion, nearly 320% global gdp.4 while household debt see gradual increase (3% growth per annum), real growth debt lie governments, financial institution corporates. in particular, government debt double since 2008, $32 trillion $67 trillion, especially government develop economy borrow heavily past years. among oecd countries, japan, greece, italy, portugal, belgium, france, spain uk government debt exceed gdps.5 this extend period historically low interest rate also enable corporates around world take advantage cheap debt. global corporate debt also nearly double past decade, $37 trillion $73 trillion, even - 4 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع surpass increase government debt. but contrary government debt, two-thirds growth corporate debt come develop countries. this pose serious risk economies, especially debt foreign currencies. we also see quality borrower deteriorate. bond rat bbb- account half global corporate bonds, compare quarter 2007, financial crisis. global debt past 20 year grow average 6% annually. if rate continue, global gdp grow 3.5% per annum projected, could see global debt next 20 year reach $780 trillion, 500% gdp. this clearly unsustainable, require urgent action government financial institutions. more critically, low interest rate environment curtail banks’ profit advance markets, jeopardize longer-term viability. and record high debt level likely pose increase risk default monetary policy tighten take course, potentially hurt quality bank assets. collectively, trend serious implication financial stability general. beyond banking, increase risk policy inaction amid weaken global governance, evident trade disputes. during global financial crisis 2008, advance country join hand fend depression well-coordinated robust policy response. in face similar threat global economy today, highlight increase risk loom u recession next 12 months, expectation unify powerful international policy response remain low, amid bicker trade issue grow nationalism. such development elevate risk global economy, particularly backdrop rise geo-political tensions. - 5 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع ii. technology the second challenge need consider impact technology bank industry. the late digital technology transform economic landscape disrupt many traditional industry along way. bank exception, financial technology fast-evolving adopt breathtaking pace. cut edge technology digital payments, mobile banking, data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain change way bank operate interact customers. fintech firm begin eliminate role many traditional intermediary financial service industry. accord mckinsey, five major bank business segment particularly risk: consumer finance; mortgages; smes; payments; wealth management. mckinsey estimate could put 40% bank revenue risk 2025.6 part reason fintech firm provide access financial service efficient cost-effective manner. for example, fintech lender 400-basis-point cost advantage bank physical distribution costs. another example execution payments; transaction use take 3 5 day process complete 3 5 seconds, le one-tenth original cost. although bank generally slow innovate, seek stay ahead game partner acquire fintech firms. accord recent pwc report, 54% bank survey already establish partnership fintech firms, 82% expect increase partnership next 3 5 years.7 - 6 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع while bank potentially manage onslaught fintech firms, real challenge pose big techs. what would happen like facebook, amazon, whatsapp, alibaba start compete bank provide financial services? these technology giant come large captive user bases, low online acquisition costs, good understand customer utilization big data. moreover, don’t face regulation associate cost bank do. tech firm eye bank industry quite time. over 20 year ago, bill gate compare bank dinosaur could bypass argue “we need banking, need bank anymore.” that early warn industry. today, see technology firm actively enter bank space, recently introduction apple card apple plan launch libra, crypto-currency facebook. bank could find sideline big tech fail actively adopt fully utilize available technologies. to prevent happening, bank need go back basic revisit core utility institution rather become constrain exist process legacy systems. iii. consumer expectation thirdly, industry need meet challenge rapidly shift customer need expectations. today, live world digitally empower consumer expect ‘on-demand services’ allow access product service wherever whenever desire. this particularly true grow number millennials soon become large customer segment bank industry. even kuwait, approximately 58% population consist millennials younger. their behavior characteristic different previous generations.8 - 7 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع 9 10 11. around 57% millennials say would change bank good digital platform. but millennials use digital platform access bank services. in 2018, 72% bank contact customer digital, 82% consumer first go online look buy new product service. in short, bank need either go digital risk sidelined. failure meet change consumer expectation serious implication banks. the recent history mobile phone industry case point. in 1997, 60% mobile phone market belong specialist mobile phone producer like nokia, motorola sony ericsson. today, market share capture samsung, apple huawei. not current market leader three entirely different firm essentially electronics computer companies, unlike past firm specialize manufacture mobile phones.12 the incumbent mobile phone company 90 fail recognize evolve need customers. ultimately, complacency saw push fringe market dominated. something similar could happen bank industry. unless pay attention serf change need customers, might sideline telecom company technology firm primary provider financial services. take example ant financial, wechat pay m-pesa, firm launch technology telecom companies. all three enjoy tremendous growth become large provider financial service respective markets. by leverage technology adopt customer-centric approach, surpass large bank markets. - 8 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع in process, attract exist customer also promote financial inclusion serve million otherwise unbanked customers. in last seven years, financial inclusion china increase 64% 80%, 42% 82% kenya, large part due emergence fintech providers.13 any three major challenge describe – difficult economic environment, grow role technology change customer expectation – would lot industry address. but take together lead perfect storm industry long afford ignore. 2- shape future for bank industry continue grow serve core utility, must transform itself. but well-established industry serve u centuries, journey transformation begin? to me, seem bank must conquer number battle survive. the crucial battle are: i. battle customer loyalty, ii. battle value, iii. battle efficiency, iv. battle resilience, v. battle talent. let discus turn. - 9 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع i. battle customer loyalty the first battle customer loyalty. bank must decide whether aim central customers’ need content merely balance sheet providers, someone else own relationship customer. in second scenario, bank would brand affinity loyalty customer would easily replaceable. a thing stand, bank industry surely struggle front. today, bank place among top twenty global brand term value. even bank decade ago since slip list. bank must work hard ensure remain first choice customers, mean take much broad view relationship customers. bank need consider help solve customers’ problem improve lives, cognizant broad social purpose promote inclusive, sustainable prosperity. after all, bank long take customer loyalty given. a recent bank consumer study conduct accenture find 40% customer express decrease dependence bank primary financial service provider 42% say use non-bank provider financial service past year. a good example non-banking provider displace traditional bank kakao bank south korea. kakao bank launch 2017 digital bank korean internet company kakao, also own popular free mobile message service kakaotalk. the bank prove incredibly successful, leverage brand affinity customer loyalty acquire 300,000 customer within first 24 hours, one million within five days, reach six million customer within year. 14 thus, within year opening, kakao bank third number customer shinhan bank, large bank south korea. this despite fact - 10 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع financial inclusion south korea already 95% time. you imagine long take kakao bank become large bank country. this example demonstrate bank cannot take customer loyalty granted. they need ensure customer engage to, want to. and way ensure understand customers, also become central evolve needs. ii. battle value to win battle customer loyalty, bank must provide value, second battle. win battle require bank adopt proactive approach position respect customers. it enough sideline as, say, purely auto finance mortgage provider. bank need position center ecosystem, provide customer best products, service advice customer require. accord accenture study, 48% customer say want relevant advice product information bank go daily lives. they also want bank play support role purchase process product house new car, even relate service insurance. bank need focus provide long-term value customers, rather view short-term opportunity sales. we already see harmful impact ‘short-term’ outlook lead subprime-mortgage crisis, bank sell mortgage customer couldn’t afford them. banks’ profit surge short term, everyone suffer end; customer broad economy also banks. bank therefore need revisit value proposition towards customer order ensure truly provide product service customer need keep interest customer society - 11 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع mind. it helpful industry reflect upon ultimate objective – ensure inclusive prosperity put welfare society sustainable footing. iii. battle efficiency to win customer provide value, bank must operate efficient intelligent manner, limit resource optimally deployed. the battle efficiency third battle bank need win. a critical front battle leverage technology data. bank need use available data improve predictive analysis, operational efficiency planning, also insight customer behavior preferences. what particularly surprise banks, though custodian vast quantity customer transaction data, utilize effectively. bank need change way segment customers, income level type accounts, potentially life cycle, growth potential, behavior patterns. data analysis provide bank actionable insight multiple factor impact business, allow improve strategic operational decision-making. moreover, bank need overhaul operations, accelerate end-to-end digitization, modernize technology infrastructure, transition towards digital channels. mckinsey estimate bank worldwide could save $400 billion year direct cost shift traditional customer digital platforms, reduce service cost 80 90%. by win battle efficiency, bank able good engage customer achieve high satisfaction rates, also curtail operational cost. - 12 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع iv. battle resilience win battle customer loyalty, value efficiency help bank grow remain relevant. but growth compromise banks’ soundness sustainability. this bring u fourth battle: battle resilience. once again, area technology, data management analytics help bank enhance risk management function strengthen resilience. bank need ensure robust capital liquidity levels, reflect traditional stability matrix, absorb shock effectively manage risks. but enhance risk identification management analyze economic, market customer data real time. institution long wait analyst review market monthly quarterly interval map back customers, asset bank’s off-balance sheet exposure. through artificial intelligence, machine learn predictive analysis, bank remain up-to-date risk exposure real time, detect individual case fraud overall balance sheet exposure across product business functions. a market move news breaks, tool base data analytics immediately update executive potential impact event business. v. battle talent none battle without right people. people core everything do, one bring everything together. this bring u fifth battle: battle talent. a bank industry go radical transition, bank need widen talent pool attract - 13 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع broad range skills, line shift business model change customers’ preferences. staff bank future long limit mostly finance professionals. instead, role data scientists, visual designers, digital market medium experts, software developer customer experience professional become significant. bank might even need recruit psychologists, philosophy major professional diversify skill bring new perspectives. these people different traditional bank recruits, different expectation roles, work environment contributions. and bank direct competition technology firms, lead corporates start-ups hire them. bank need overhaul entire process around acquiring, managing, deploy retain talent. like technology companies, need invest talent pool leverage expertise creativity. they also need transform corporate culture one promote agility, collaboration responsible risk-taking come delivery solutions. the bank industry need succeed battle fronts: customer loyalty, value, efficiency, resilience talent. failure win front could dire consequences, regardless bank’s size market share. we take lesson company industry ignore lesson suffer result. a prime example kodak, dominant name photography market century. at peak, kodak’s share photographic film market 80% u.s. around 50% globally. kodak make significant profit sale development camera film expect trend continue. while arrival digital camera change industry dynamics, kodak didn’t want risk cannibalize - 14 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع camera film business fail see potential new technology risk new competitors. instead, choose stay comfort zone, conduct business usual, fail understand evolve need customers. that lead ultimate demise, kodak file bankruptcy protection 2012. contrast apple’s launch ipad. despite ipad’s potential cannibalize computer business, apple go ahead order serve need customers. it afraid embrace change, even cost traditional business products, ipad prove one apple’s successful products. equally critical timely identify act upon valuable opportunity amid shift market preferences. microsoft miss opportunity dominate mobile operate system. the void microsoft could fill soon capture android operate system. bill gate term “greatest mistake ever” cost microsoft $400 billion. so, focus five key battle – customer loyalty, value, efficiency, resilience talent – bank industry transform future avoid fate kodak. 3-the role enable stakeholder we see importance customers, technology data future banking. but important recognize journey bank take alone. rather, need support key stakeholders; otherwise succeed make minor, superficial change rather achieve genuine transformation. the role two key stakeholder worth highlighting; educational institution regulators. i. educational institution - 15 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع let u consider first critical role educational institutions. they need ensure prepare graduate future job bank industry, job require traditional study finance, economics business, also encompass new skill around financial technological innovation. it increasingly evident job future fundamentally different job today. accord recent report world economic forum (wef) future jobs, 75 million job may displace 2022, 133 million new role may emerge.15 be prepare graduate shift labor market? this equally pertinent question bank industry. accord wef study, 56% bank employee need re-skilled. talent resource number function need shift towards analytics, few resource likely involve manual work. new staff need data scientist expertise ai, machine learning, etc. and business staff require ability translate data insight business actions. the wef report large barrier embrace technology banks, identify 74% financial institution surveyed, lack skill set local labor market. if case today, happen future? this bank industry need build strong partnership educational institutions, ensure prepare graduate industry require transformation. ii. regulator the key stakeholder bank industry’s transformative journey regulator. regulatory authority need strike balance protect consumers, establish standard sound regulatory supervisory practices, safeguard financial monetary stability, time facilitate growth innovation industry. - 16 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع but industry go transformation, regulator must also consider operate future. we need take proactive dynamic approach promote innovation, act catalyst industry. we need promote collaboration share experience develop framework fit need societies. and need focus capacity build ensure staff meet future challenge industry. we cbk firmly believe innovation, collaboration capacity building; principle drive force behind many recent initiative fulfil role enabler catalyst industry. in term innovation, cbk play part support bank industry. last year, launch fintech regulatory sandbox. globally, 36 innovation lab 48 regulatory sandbox already introduce different regulators. regulator use tool create safe space experimentation innovative product services, thus ensure safety soundness financial system without stifle innovation.16 we cbk also prepare infrastructure future aspiration would enable truly digital economy. we develop state-of-the-art infrastructure project, kuwait national payment system. this make eight system enable real time payment safe, secure, reliable efficient manner ready fintech deployment. internally, re-engineering process regulation enhance data gather analysis, fully digitize process supervisory functions. this pre-requisite future implementation artificial intelligence suptech. - 17 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع in addition, work initiative open bank framework, provide client comprehensive information financial stand across multiple banks. we also process roll e-kyc framework, allow anyone open account electronically, easily efficiently. in 2014, kuwait issue electronic transaction law, provide legal foundation electronic payment make digital signature legally binding. in term collaboration, cbk undertake number initiative increase cross-border cooperation regulator region. for example, work 20 country develop arab payment system, addition gcc real time gross settlement system. in addition, cbk spearhead gcc-wide cybersecurity framework allow seamless security information-sharing across region, order safeguard gcc bank institution mitigate cyber threats. within kuwait, also engage closely different government institution capital market authority, ministry commerce industry communication information technology regulatory authority. and finally, cbk focus continuous capacity build ensure development sustainability team provide technical support industry. through kuwait institute bank study (kibs), support sophisticate program tailor specific area focus equip team well bank industry late tool know-how. kib play critical role promote capacity build kuwait, provide train 4,700 bank staff last year alone. i delight announce launch “kafaa” initiative, collaboration kuwait institute bank study kuwaiti banks. kafaa provide advance - 18 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع program financial sector employee include post graduate studies, cyber-security, risk management, shariah audit, etc. in addition, proud kuwait host sponsor imf’s middle east centre economic finance (cef), provide train candidate across arab world. last year, 1,477 candidate benefit program run centre, total cost $9.1 million. with support enable institution educator regulators, bank industry transform future play rightful role support inclusive, sustainable prosperity. conclusion i think quite clear bank industry long afford continue conduct business usual ignore issue i highlighted. the bank industry must take stock external challenge face today, include difficult economic environment, impact evolve technology shift customer expectations. it must focus win customer loyalty, provide value, operate efficiently resiliently, attract right talent. in addition, enable institution educator regulator need provide necessary support industry succeed transformative journey. the industry clearly crossroad need make proactive decision remain relevant future. there two path industry take. if bank industry continue operate way past, ignore many challenge face today, would lose dominant position. competition - 19 - central bank kuwait - public يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع increase different institution telecom operators, technology company fintech firms, customer flock solutions, already see markets. banks, result, push fringe industry, remove altogether. but industry manage evolve, picture could different. by win battle customer loyalty, value, efficiency, resilience talent, bank remain dominant player space. the bank future completely unrecognizable today. it close customers, digitally enabled, ahead curve come anticipate customer needs. it efficient, resilient good able address economic social challenge future. in end, collectively, key stakeholder industry take difficult yet necessary step require shape future bank industry. a einstein said: “a new type think essential

bring three things: expertise, money perspective crucial help society adjust reality transition. my message is, whether it’s reduce protection gap, finance resilient infrastructure improve reporting, risk management return optimisation across financial sector, contribution could decisive. the insurance industry unique contribution large capital (over $30 trillion), deep risk management expertise long-term perspective. insurer well aware physical risk climate change felt across globe plague extreme weather events. the human cost immeasurable. the financial loss however measure significant. insure loss 2018 $80 billion, double inflation-adjusted average past 30 years.10 but protection gap low middle income country mean even great cost bear uninsured. in 2017, record $140 billion insure

low middle income countries.15 new products, insurance-linked security base parametric triggers, vital help reduce macro protection gap increase resilience. these generally cheap structure administer efficient blend commercial finance required. of course, increasingly climate-related tail risk could prove uneconomic private sector insurer cover. that development agency multilateral development bank step in. disaster reinsurance could one effective us development financing. on asset side, infrastructure investment essential. to transition net zero, country need step investment sustainable energy. the reality climate change also mean countries, particularly develop emerge economies, need invest new climate-resilient infrastructure order adapt new reality hot volatile climate. there various estimate – enormous - range us$70-90 trillion next decade, three quarter emerge develop economies.16 it’s imperative act create practical tool framework support climate-resilient

regulatory treatment infrastructure debt separate asset class. now, international association insurance supervisor (iais) review data source gap consider risk case differentiate capital treatment infrastructure global insurance capital standard – ic 2.0. we also need develop condition make infrastructure asset readily investable easily tradable. under argentine g20 presidency last year,

become easy invest in, easy insure, project risk good managed. data input impact infrastructure project also improved. for instance, data project phase would allow comparison across construction phase infrastructure versus non-infrastructure assets. information type concession license offer different region important determine kind revenue arrangement infrastructure projects, ultimately influence cash flow stability – critical information investors. the iais develop workplan examine data gap come year. reporting, risk management return turn mainstream investing. change climate policies, technology physical risk transition net zero world prompt reassessment value virtually every asset. the financial system reward company adjust punish don’t. insurer highly influential bring reality climate change mainstream financial decision-making. to so, need step change three areas: reporting, risk management return. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 8 8

governor central bank chile the chilean financial system change notably past four decades. while early 1980s center one bad economic social crisis history, major source strength, provide resilience economy face external shocks. so, happen? what source resilience? what new challenge lie ahead? that purpose presentation. in nutshell, argue regulatory change follow crisis set new framework that, far prevent financial development facilitate way consistent economic development. some key reform –most notably pension reform—facilitated emergence new actors, make financial sector diverse, deep forward-looking. many piece evidence test semi-annual financial stability report, demonstrate recent year chilean financial sector currently well equip face external shocks, provide key support flexible exchange rate regime reduce exposure business financial sector fx fluctuations. similarly, development long-term capital market secure local currency finance investment project government itself. the relationship financial sector fx market indeed important part presentation connection financial macro stability. this important pillar small open economy like chile, capital account open almost 20 year ago. this is, time, area make additional progress, i share immediate plan combine well agenda minister larrain presented. central bank chile september 2019 page 2 20 some 50 year ago, bank almost source finance firm households. the chilean economy close international trade capital flows, interest rate regulated, credit restricted, bank activity largely control state. in second half 1970s, bank sector privatize liberalized. however, accompany adequate regulation supervision; relatively small financial system build major vulnerabilities. when macro policy misstep external shock hit 1982, bank sector weak link: amplify shock lead country deep economic financial crisis generation. financial crisis abrupt, costly protract affairs, chilean financial crisis early eighty exception. this crisis often place among top 25 severe financial crisis modern history. central bank chile september 2019 page 3 20 in 1981, annual output growth go positive 9% first quarter, 0% fourth quarter, minus 14% 1982. that year, unemployment reach record 25%, business country seriously hampered, ultimately affect solvency. bank profitability go quickly negative territory delinquency rate quadruple 15% total portfolio, put several bank risk. several factor contribute deterioration macroeconomic environment 1982. external interest rate rose, availability external credit decreased, term trade worsen wake escalation oil prices. this put enormous pressure chilean peso—which fix exchange rate scheme since 1979. this regime break dramatically spread almost business sectors, give large fx exposures, heavily leverage financial conglomerates. central bank chile september 2019 page 4 20 all factor interact one another become outright bank crisis. nevertheless, whatever cause crisis, unsustainable debt mostly explain internal vulnerabilities: inappropriate regulation, weak supervision, lack attention excessive credit growth, leverage fix exchange rate scheme. the lesson learn crisis highlight fact bank regulation supervision need substantially upgraded. in 1986, general bank law introduce limitation currency mismatch, constraint relate party lending, restriction bank pay kind instead liquid resources. all element common practice 1982 crisis. paradoxically, could consider harsh regulation hamper financial deepening. instead, foster systematic buildup solvency credibility bank system allow healthy development ensue decades. yet 1986 bank law hardly piece financial architecture change significantly. notably, creation fund pension system, subsequent capital market reforms, together capital market openness, dramatically change size, composition, depth, strength financial sector chile. central bank chile september 2019 page 5 20 by funnel household save capital markets, pension fund especially important early development deep debt market; contribution market-making benefit stable macroeconomic environment control inflation, extensive use uf (a currency unit index inflation), restructure central bank’s debt long maturities. a deep liquid debt market also facilitate price debt issue private company local markets. over time, pension fund allow invest abroad. this foster profitability diversification pension funds, prevent distort price domestic financial sector, create two-way street capital flow manage domestic agents. a foreign asset pension fund need protect fx risk, hedge market also developed. this fit well change macroeconomic side. in late 1990s chile adopt flexible exchange rate regime liberalize capital flows. central bank chile september 2019 page 6 20 all reform lead develop chilean financial system sound way. currently place chile near median group country term private indebtedness. how chilean financial market currently combine exchange rate regime? under flexible exchange regime adopt 1999 take account reform mention above, surprise chile relatively volatile currency. however, term gdp growth appear stable peers. central bank chile september 2019 page 7 20 this due, part, fact households, government small business expose exchange rate risk, either borrow foreign currency hold natural hedge. paradoxically, give openness capital account free exchange rate, chile dollarized country all. bank regulators, hand learn well lesson 1980s crisis fx exposure central risk assessment prevention. large companies, hand, draw openness economy prestige local regulation take advantage overseas bond market avoid undertake fx risk. corporation learn operate flexible fx environment use both, natural market-based fx risk hedge instruments. this, turn, also support development derivative market, pension fund key counterpart well. central bank chile september 2019 page 8 20 total external debt dollar stable last years, around us$120 billion. a substantial part reflect grow internationalization chilean corporate sector. a large share total associate foreign direct investment (fdi) local subsidiary multinational corporations. to extent fdi represent commitment relate companies, enforceability debt repayment associate financial condition respond different factor case debt institutions, mitigate risk event increase finance costs. among firm report fmc, two-thirds external debt concentrate among company use u.s. dollar account currency, share stable last decade. learn previous episodes, risk associate external debt remain low, give characteristic debt appropriate use hedge firms. among firm report pesos, debt mostly concentrate limit individual currency mismatch: firm mismatch central bank chile september 2019 page 9 20 10% asset hold 3% external debt, represent 10% total number company use chilean peso account currency. local institutional investors’ participation local sovereign debt market, especially long segment yield curve, much high chile emerge economies, 80 90%. thus, buy-and-hold strategy investor reduce volatility local sovereign rate domestic fund costs. by now, chilean financial sector one develop emerge world. it transit largely dominate traditional bank compose several market participants, include pension funds, general fund administrator insurance companies; among others. asset management non-bank investor go le 1% gdp 1984, central bank chile september 2019 page 10 20 65% 2000, almost 100% gdp 2018. this development translate improve access alternative source fund chilean firms. currently, around 85% total corporate bond hold institutional investors, thus reliance bank credit corporation go 91% financial debt 1986 around 25% recent years. financial development important firm also country whole. a deep far-reaching financial system contribute build financial economic inclusion, financial stability external shocks. in respect, chilean financial system show good performance latin american emerge economies, dimension like market capitalization, number branch per inhabitant, use derivatives, participation domestic credit private sector, name few. nonetheless, increase development complexity financial market also mean risk may higher, strong sophisticate regulatory framework required. central bank chile september 2019 page 11 20 the chilean financial crisis early eighty lead radical bank regulation revision, also learn valuable lesson future. a deep properly regulate financial system contribute financial stability, inclusion increase welfare. even though significant progress make regard, still challenge ahead must face strengthen financial system. let address regulatory challenge cbc work on. central bank chile september 2019 page 12 20 in order deep fx market enhance resilience financial sector number measure take central bank chile (cbc). the internationalization chilean peso enhance financial stability, alleviate liquidity concern stress episode reduce counterparty risks, among effects. all change must accompany robust develop financial infrastructures. also, wide cross-border usage chilean peso improve position financial center. regard concrete measure towards accomplish goals, cbc review fx regulation, order modernize simplify it. in addition, large develop fx market benefit access robust financial market infrastructures. central bank chile september 2019 page 13 20 in order so, cbc issue regulation implement trade repository otc derivatives, rely current faculty coordination financial market commission. additionally, cbc work initiative allow real time gross settlement (rtgs) payment system settle u dollar large-value interbank transactions. these measure add future inclusion chilean peso first cls-eligible currency south america. this priority cbc, therefore work closely cl bank materialize next three years. we believe policy actions, well announce minister finance order promote chile regional financial center, greatly contribute resilient financial sector, wide cross-border use chilean peso great participation non-residents fx market.  the strategic plan 2018-2022 cbc include thorough review fx regulation. current fx regulation require fx transaction execute “formal exchange market” —which comprise bank stockbrokers— report cbc. these two element remain largely unchanged since capital account open 20 year ago. back then, re-imposing capital control could rule out, rationale underlie somewhat cumbersome structure fx regulation. currently, capital control still part regulatory toolbox, re-imposing could consider exceptional situation. therefore, cbc decide streamline fx regulation reduce burden compliance private sector, whenever possible, without affect quality statistical information capacity act extreme scenario. the first part process, eliminate exist report requirements, put public consultation. central bank chile september 2019 page 14 20  modernize fx transaction go beyond review exist report requirement structure regulation. it also consider review long-standing policy definitions. one definition restrictive regulation term currency denomination fx transactions. the central bank’s law establish fx transaction cannot denominate clp unless authorize central bank. this faculty use exceptionally, see tool prevent circumvention capital controls. consequently, instance, resident cannot grant clp denominate credit non-residents (but foreign currency). while provision prevent transaction occur, add transaction cost may prevent wide cross-border use chilean peso. the cbc implement free-floating exchange rate regime, possibility capital control extremely exceptional even apply measure might effective prevent circumvention. therefore cbc consider extension present transaction authorize denominate chilean peso (bonds issue chile non-residents, transaction foreign securities), well relate condition authorization. such provide information cbc. this change policy put public consultation end year. central bank chile september 2019 page 15 20 the central bank develop new regulatory framework allow real time gross settlement (rtgs) interbank payment u.s. dollars, incorporation currency rtgs system manage operate cbc. the financial system’s large-value payment national currency currently settle rtgs system, payment final irrevocable accordance international practices. in contrast, foreign currency payment settle correspondent banks, process exempt credit, operational, liquidity risk. the requirement new regulatory framework define take account international experience risk considerations, draft regulation publish public consultation within next weeks. dollar settlement cbc improve competitiveness local infrastructure promote development financial market. moreover, implementation initiative align local fmis international standards, recommend settlement rtgs system due contribution risk management participants, function economy, preservation financial stability. central bank chile september 2019 page 16 20 another initiative currently development incorporation chilean peso continuous link settlement system (cls). this financial market infrastructure currently international standard settlement cross-currency payment reduce risk settlement, also know hersttat risk, barely zero. currently, 18 currency allow settle cls. the cbc along cl bank sector work make clp 19th currency system. in addition act accordance financial stability mandate

settlement cl one benefit system. moreover, cl reduce liquidity need participant use multilateral netting, enhance confidence, particularly time financial stress. from general perspective, satisfactory cl due diligence process along broad international participation trade clp, strong signal development competitiveness chilean financial markets. the process chilean peso become first south american currency cl started. last july, receive visit cl executive conversation market participant fruitful discussion cbc. after visit, cl cbc start due diligence process. during phase, action public private sector essential. nevertheless, successful process end 2021. the cbc will take necessary measure include clp cls, extend open hour rtgs system. central bank chile september 2019 page 18 20 relate financial market infrastructures, i would like mention last june cbc issue new regulation framework implement first trade repository (tr) country. this tr, call integrate system derivative information (siid, spanish), own operate central and, transition process, full operation 2021. the siid collect, store disseminate information otc derivative trades, follow principle financial market infrastructure (pfmis) international standard reporting. this infrastructure promote transparency market conduct, improve decision-making market participants, contribute supervision process financial market commission. it important note minister finance announce bill regulate trade repository send congress. the siid perfectly compatible existence private-owned trade repositories. central bank chile september 2019 page 19 20 accord late bi triennial review foreign exchange otc derivatives, chilean peso represent 0.2% global fx turnover. we strongly believe share increase future. the different development underway contribute financial stability increase cross-border use clp, well participation non-residents domestic market. therefore, authority market participant prepare part big internationally integrate fx market. let conclude remark journey chilean financial system, deep financial crisis, lead new bank regulation also valuable lesson learn future. a deep properly regulate financial system contribute financial stability, inclusion increase welfare. central bank chile september 2019 page 20 20 prevent stress episode task require constant monitor early detection potential source vulnerability risk. the enactment new bank general act internationalization chilean peso, among measures, open new phase modern regulation. even though significant progress make regard, still challenge ahead must face strengthen financial system. *** 1 open remark veerathai santiprabhob, governor bank thailand asean bank cybersecurity conference 2019 crystal hall, 3rd floor, the athenee hotel, bangkok, thailand 6 september, 2019 tba board directors, tba members, member asean bank community, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, i delight morning, i would like thank tb-cert invite speak event. technology internet undeniably become integrate daily lives. customers’ behavior continue evolve adapt technological progresses. in response, new technology develop serve accommodate customers’ ever-evolving needs. a prime example invention smartphone decade ago, completely transform way life increase people’s connectivity unprecedented levels. the bank industry, too, undergo massive digitalization, user-facing tool like mobile bank apps back-end infrastructure essentially everything between. these development key driver behind convenience productivity enjoy today. but, inherent invention, technological revolution come form risk: cyber risks. the “digital” bank become, channel potential point attack cyber criminals, constantly evolve exploit new loopholes. even loophole identify patch issued, delay update could also pose potential risk. we repeatedly witness various—and many time severe—cyber-related incident often revolve around financial institutions. some infamous example include bangladesh bank incident, hack atm taiwan various countries, target’s credit card data breach result data 2 70 million credit card stolen, equifax’s data leakage company fin 700 million usd, recently case capital one bank 100 million customers’ data leaked. thailand also immune cyber threats. a state bank’s atm hacked, customers’ data 2 large bank leak dark web, wannacry ransomware outbreak. in addition attack financial institutions, customers’ behavior lack cyber threat awareness also pose significant cyber risk well. social medium scam line facebook messenger attacker pretend victim’s acquaintance, ask favor transfer money; users’ submit bank account information questionable, illegal gamble website data eventually get leak week prior example cyber-attacks hinge user’s inexperience lack awareness online threats. a such, i don’t think exaggeration say cyber threat keep many bank executive regulator awake night give nature threat occur anytime anywhere without warning, significant damage could cause. in address threats, important operate assumption matter “if” rather “when” threat occur, focus solely “protection” “detection” long sufficient. in words, cybersecurity alone enough, also need proactively think cyber resilience: prepare, also withstand recover disruptions. in short time i today, i’d like highlight three key driver effective cyber resilience. first, cyber resilience responsibility company’s it department, rather important, organization-wide agenda. the board director senior management must understand endeavor prioritize cyber risk management framework organization’s operation. this include make sure cyber resilience policy put place apply effectively, set clear organizational structure include role responsibility staff across levels, establish risk management process accord international practices, ensure employee always vigilant cyber security issues. the bank thailand, example, require financial institution least one member it knowledge it-related experience board directors. we also organize regular capacity-building course board member high-level executive thai financial institution provide knowledge 3 understand address cyber threats. in addition tone top, staff member operational level must also vigilant cyber risk involve day-to-day tasks. second, past much effort put reinforce protection detection systems, must shift focus towards improve response recovery. readiness address cyber-attacks—preparing response plan playbook—remains common gap among financial institutions. frequent cyber exercise also crucial, vulnerability response plan often discover exercise allow organization continually improve response processes. regular practice best practice. not exercise do individual firms, also industry level. the financial sector, example, start exercise within bank sector soon expand part financial sector. a time go by, society become interconnected, eventually cyber resilience exercise need do inter-industry level. for instance, bank sector need joint exercise telecommunication company scenario involve mobile bank attacks, utility sector power outage scenarios. third, collaboration information share crucial strengthen overall cyber resilience. cyber threat become much complex individual organization’s defensive technology may able catch up. close cooperation share cyber threat information help organization good monitor development cyber threats, recognize unfamiliar threats, develop comprehensive plan deal issues. cooperation also information sharing: whether cooperation term supervision, development standards, cyber exercises, capability building. these kind cooperation would eventually create “cybersecurity ecosystem” require effort sides, include governments, regulatory agencies, private sector, education sector. it welcome today already number information share platform available national, regional, international levels. thailand’s finance, banking, capital markets, insurance industry establish computer emergency response team (cert) respective industry. the team share cybersecurity information daily basis. at regional level, asean establish cybersecurity resilience information share platform (crisp). the central banks, regulators, supervisor (ceres) forum serf 4 platform international community. these collaboration multiple level present opportunity country learn one another. more recently, capacity 2019 asean chairman, thailand collaborate bank international settlement (bis) organize asean financial regulators’ program cyber resilience, series train programs, last conclude yesterday. we envision cyber range collaboration continue hold asean member go forward. although financial sector make significant progress term cyber resilience, never-ending development cyber threat mean must continue improve defenses. in regard, remain many issue bank thailand, along central bank region, intend drive forward, oversee comprehensive cyber resilience policy promote development human resources. in response cyber-attacks may target vulnerable customers, crucial strive increase consumer technology literacy nudge towards safe cyber behavior ensure sufficient level cyber hygiene. lady gentlemen, i would like take opportunity thank thai bankers’ association tb-cert organize “asean bank cybersecurity conference 2019” bring asean member together today. this opportunity gain knowledge expertise different areas, also enhance connectivity collaboration among professional vital improve cyber resilience go forward. i

(graph 7 – synchronise nordic monetary cycles). while danmark nationalbank meet objective ensure stable price denmark via fix exchange rate policy, many central bank use interest rate target inflation directly. although nordic country implement different monetary policy regimes, economic implication reality quite similar. the reason might interest rate across economy heavily influence global financial cycle at centre federal reserve. there high degree spill-overs financial mar-kets different countries. therefore, change financial condition large economy like u quickly transmit condition financially open economies. it thus impossible nordic country insulate monetary policy central bank large countries, unless capital flow controlled. financial interdependence reduce ability monetary policy target domestic economic condition independently. page 4 6 the high degree synchronisation monetary policy rate nordic country support line thinking. we occasionally face short-term cost procyclical interest rate changes, see wake financial crisis. however, period occur rarely often last short time. several study find danish monetary policy, general, work countercycli-cally, business cycle denmark highly synchronise business cycle euro area. most importantly, monetary regime credible. in general, evidence show choice monetary policy regime might important stabilisation business cy-cle. monetary policy maker one face challenge low level interest rates. high save rates, profitable investment opportunity negative interest rate also impose challenge time investors. this include pension fund commercial banks. this least case denmark large part pension system funded. a conse-quence denmark pension fund turn attention away bond towards equity so-called alternative investment infrastructure, forests, energy sup-ply etc. it remain see whether risk associate investment correctly estimate priced. the lack market price lack liquidity many invest-ments clearly pose risk expect materialise fully economic downturn. by reduce stock define benefit pension plans, pension fund manage transfer large share risk stem low yield environment pensioners. in general, pension way allocate society's aggregate income across generation - close econ-omy would mean domestic production. choose fund system relative example pay-as-you-go system basically question create right incentive finance pensions. that is, pay pension contribution rather taxes. fund pension tend good tackle demographic changes, pay-as-you-go system tend good cop large transitory shocks, e.g. large change inflation rates. a mix system like danish one therefore seem good solution secure decent consumption level retirement. if yield alternative investment pension fund turn disappoint, open question remains: actually pick bill retirement young generations? it certain future pensioner accept low benefits, even though currently take risk move towards fund pensions. the government might end "pension provid-er last resort". another question whether low yield affect pension contribution pension funds? on one hand, low interest rate might make le beneficial transfer income pension savings. this refer substitution effect. on hand, pensioner need save receive amount benefit retirement age - so-called in-come effect. empirical study show increase after-tax yield pension sav-ings tend incentivise people transfer income save account pensions, page 5 6 keep total amount save unchanged. this experience point potential de-cline pension contribution due low interest rates. however, prospect long pe-riod low interest rates, so-called "new normal", create unprecedented situation. so pension saver may choose increase pension contribution compensate lose yield. time tell. (graph 8 – banks' earn remain high). the low level interest rate may also challenge banks' ability make profits. i acknowledge bank way challenge present interest rate environment. fortunately, danish bank able generate profit source income. while net interest income dwindled, bank increase income fee administration margin mortgages. moreover, favourable macroeconomic set underpin interest rate policy central bank well asset purchase programmes. the macroeconomic set contribute low level loan impairment charge danish banks. in fact, danish bank experience period record profit recent years. however, impairment charge cannot continue currently low levels. if look ahead, earn expect decrease again. (graph 9 – recession risks). even though unconventional measure remain part monetary policy toolbox, doubt le leeway previously monetary policy support economy case down-turn. this important insight situation heighten risk global recession. with almost 10 year uninterrupted growth, u economy experience record-long economic expan-sion. history show extend period optimism tend cause "speed blindness", sow seed downturn. it may difficult predict u economy hit downturn recession, his-torically, invert yield curve signal upcoming recession. and moment, face situation yield 3-month u treasury exceed yield 10-year government bonds. however, yield curve affect number factor besides expectation cycli-cal turn point. these include federal reserve's asset purchase programme. this may re-duce predictive power invert yield curve. page 6 6 survey also indicate perceive recession risk financial market rise last couple years. the trade conflict u china may trigger. in general, history show upswings inevitably follow downturn market economy. the danish economy well-positioned withstand possible global downturn. the upswing past six year balanced. low rate result excessive surge investment hamper household savings. on contrary, household consumption ratio relatively low, despite rise disposable income high household net wealth. let conclude think title speech: "low long - cause conse-quences". the pertinent question "how long long". we know. what know prudent financial sector investor prepare long period low interest rates. this - speak - new normal. it create new challenge financial sector. the thing adapt. and true monetary policy. thank listening. danmark nationalbank low for long – cause and consequence ​governor lars rohde, cfa society denmark conference, 19 september 2019 -1.00-0.75-0.50-0.250.000.250.500.751.0005101520durationper centultimo 2018september 2019danish government bonds: the whole curve negative territory ​note: the yield curve 16 september 2019. 18. september 2019 2 -6-4-202468per centnatural real interest ratereal interest rate73767982858891949700030609121518decline natural real interest rate (r*) ​source: danmark nationalbank. 18. september 2019 3 select contributers global save glut ​private financial wealth per cent global gdp ​source: credit suisse global wealth databook, oecd, imf, norsk oliefond. 18. september 2019 4 -20-15-10-50510152025-20-15-10-50510152025per cent, y-yper centinflationlong term interest rate (right hand axes) 1900191019201930194019501960197019801990200020102020low level inflation present 18. september 2019 5 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,000-202468per centdanmarksnationalbank's monetary policy rateecb's monetary policy ratebalance sheet ecbbillioneuro0001020304050607080910111213141516171819unconventional monetary policy play large role 18. september 2019 6 -2-1012345678per centswedennorwayfinlanddenmark0001020304050607080910111213141516171819synchronised cycle nordic monetary policy rate 18. september 2019 7 note: danmark nationalbank's certificate deposit rate denmark (certificate deposit rate lend rate identical june 2009). sverige riksbank's repo rate sweden. norge bank's policy rate norway. until 14. october 2008, ecb's main refinance rate finland, hereafter ecb's deposit rate. source: thomson reuters datastream danmark nationalbank. -100102030405060kr. billionyearly profit/lossbefore taxesreturn certificate deposit danmark nationalbank201020112012201320142015201620172018banks' earn remain high 18. september 2019 8 heighten risk global recession ​note: see "heightened risk global recession" , danmark nationalbank analysis no.16, 2019, details. ​source: nationalbanken. 18. september 2019 9 science po paris – paris, 18 september 2019 inaugural lesson paris school international affairs, françois villeroy de galhau governor banque de france what economic sovereignty europe? face threat lucidity, boldly seize opportunity press contact: mark deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr;

raghuram rajan big round applause. toward sustain virtuous cycle speech meet councillor nippon keidanren (japan business federation) tokyo bank japan december 26, 2019 haruhiko kuroda governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction it great honor opportunity address distinguish gather business leader japan today. it week first year new reiwa era come end. today, wrap 2019, i would first like take look back year's economic development home abroad talk bank japan's conduct monetary policy. then, i touch development japan's economy somewhat long-term perspective future challenges. specifically, i explain mechanism virtuous cycle operate japan's economy challenge sustain cycle. i. this year's economic development home abroad continue slowdown global economy start look back development global economy year, slowdown continue observe (chart 1). at meet three year ago, i say global economy finally seem enter new phase put negative legacy global financial crisis behind it. in fact, global economy register relatively high growth 2017 2018, partly reflect global increase it-related demand boost business fix investment. however, phase shift start around mid-2018. this mainly tension u.s.-china trade friction begin heighten global cycle it-related good enter adjustment phase. back then, seem prevail view adjustment would come end shortly global economy would head toward pick-up second half 2019. however, turn remain deceleration phase whole year. a pick-up global economy delayed, due mainly intensify prolong u.s.-china trade friction continue slowdown chinese economy, global economy yet move situation. what outlook global economy next year? the bank project growth rate rise moderately mid-2020, although subject considerable uncertainties. accord late world economic outlook (weo) release international monetary fund (imf), global growth rate also project recover 2 3.4 percent 2020, around past average, 3.0 percent 2019. there three major reason behind bank's projection. first uncertainty global economy, include development u.s.-china trade negotiations, ease somewhat. a i explain earlier, global economic slowdown year attributable mainly political geopolitical uncertainties, u.s.-china trade friction brexit. it significant uncertainty easing, least extent. second global cycle it-related goods, exert downward pressure global economy year, pick up. world semiconductor shipment recently turn increase. the adjustment phase global cycle it-related goods, start around mid-2018, finally seem come end. third effect country's macroeconomic policy. since turn year, many emerge economy reduce policy rates, federal reserve european central bank (ecb) conduct monetary easing. this likely underpin global economy. however, bank consider downside risk regard outlook global economy remain significant. a u.s.-china trade negotiations, remain point disagreement two countries, regard industrial policy. in addition, necessary pay attention factor uncertainty emerge economy geopolitical risks. thus, future development global economy likely continue warrant close attention time being. development japan's economy next, i talk japan's economy (chart 2). look back year, reflect effect global economic slowdown, export continue show weakness manufacturers' sentiment become cautious. on hand, domestic demand continue uptrend, nonmanufacturers' sentiment remain high level whole. in past, many case japan change global economy external demand affect overall development economy relatively quickly. however, unique current phase domestic demand remain firm far 3 despite weak external demand. one factor underpin firm domestic demand business fix investment. accord december tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), business fix investment plan continue increase steadily (chart 3). this increase business fix investment underpin sustain investment le susceptible short-term economic developments, include labor-saving efficiency-improving investment, construction investment, research development (r&d) investment growth areas. this likely bring firm domestic demand unlikely affect external demand. in addition, private consumption continue increase moderately back steady improvement employment income situation. for time being, effect october 2019 consumption tax hike warrant attention. private consumption register somewhat large decline october, partly affect natural disaster typhoons. however, exclude effects, reactionary decline demand tax hike seem small previous tax hike 2014. a outlook, domestic demand likely follow uptrend virtuous cycle income spend operating. although pace increase expect decelerate temporarily, affect global economic slowdown date, consumption tax hike, natural disasters, large decline likely avoided. in addition, global growth rate project rise. under circumstances, japan's economy expect continue moderate expand trend. let move price development (chart 4). look back year, year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food decelerate somewhat, partly due effect decline energy prices. however, exclude fresh food energy, clearly show underlie trend cpi, somewhat high compare last year. a outlook, year-on-year rate change cpi likely increase gradually toward price stability target firms' households' perception price improve amid continuation expand economic trend. 4 ii. the bank's conduct monetary policy next, i talk bank's conduct monetary policy. the bank pursue powerful monetary ease aim achieve price stability target 2 percent since introduction quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) 2013 (chart 5). in situation, global economic slowdown continue downside risk japan's economic activity price become significant year, bank clarify policy stance tilt toward monetary accommodation since around summer. in october, view make clearer, bank decide new forward guidance, whereby would maintain policy rate present level or, depend situation, low levels, long downside risk economic activity price remain significantly high. while continue carefully examine various risks, bank hesitate take additional ease measure great possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target lost. meanwhile, early month, government release comprehensive economic measure create future security growth. recently, cooperation monetary fiscal authority increasingly draw attention globally, let explain basic think it. if government implement fiscal policy central bank pursue monetary ease achieve inflation target, economic stimulus effect become powerful synergy effects. such combination policy call policy mix, standard approach macroeconomic policy. therefore, economic measure government recently implement exert significant effect maintain expand trend economy bank's pursuit powerful monetary easing. that said, cooperation monetary fiscal authority entail difficulty term ensure public confidence toward macroeconomic policy. in economic theory, policy mix assume conduct appropriate manner monetary fiscal policy base particular policy objectives. in recent discussions, however, seem confuse policy mix debt monetization central banks. thus, 5 important clarify role consider monetary-fiscal policy mix. in joint statement release government bank japan january 2013, take point account make clear. the government bank confirm statement would work within respective autonomy fulfill roles, framework seem function effectively. iii. toward sustain virtuous cycle i look back year's development economic activity home abroad explain bank's monetary policy conduct period. in follows, i would like talk development japan's economy somewhat long-term perspective. japan's economy improve significantly since introduction qqe 2013. three virtuous mechanism operate behind this. the first virtuous cycle income spend corporate sector. the second virtuous cycle household sector. and third virtuous cycle operate corporate household sectors, whereby increase corporate profit lead rise wages, enable firm raise sell prices, result increase corporate profits. it important disrupt virtuous cycle order achieve sustainable economic growth japan. today, i would like focus two cycle particular relevant business managers: (1) cycle income spend corporate sector (2) cycle wage prices. cycle income spend corporate sector let first talk cycle income spend corporate sector. look back somewhat long-term perspective, collapse bubble economy 1990s significant turn point japanese firms' behavior (chart 6). after bubble burst, firm negative toward undertake fix investment prolong period, mainly background burden bring excess production capacity accumulate bubble period corporate profit remain low follow deflation. moreover, hamper accumulation capital stock innovation, become one factor low japan's growth potential. 6 a remarkable change situation observe introduction qqe 2013 (chart 7). to begin with, corporate profit improve clearly. although recently show weakness part, due effect slowdown overseas economies, remain historical high levels. in situation, business fix investment turn uptrend gradually. however, even 2013, compare favorable corporate profits, cautiousness remain firms' fix investment stance, firm continue save profit (chart 8). one multiple factor behind seem rise demand precautionary save firms' side, reflection experience severe recessions, collapse bubble economy global financial crisis. however, firms' fix investment stance clearly become active past years, corporate profit remain high levels. although earn surplus continue increase, cash deposit stop accumulate since 2018. the proportion business fix investment relative cash flow increased, firm come use much profit fix investment. in addition, current steady business fix investment -- mainly term sustain investment -- despite weak external demand seem attributable partly firms' fix investment stance, generally become active. firms' active stance toward fix investment also lead rise japan's growth potential accumulation capital stock rise productivity. of course, economic policy structural reform contribute enhance potential. monetary policy also play part rise growth potential; due powerful monetary easing, japan's economy long deflation firms' overly pessimistic view eased. however, main drive force rise growth potential private sector, mutual interaction firms' innovation investment important anything else. in order enhance japan's growth potential, firm need continue positive investment lead creation new value improvement productivity. it investment address digitalize society expect one area positive investment. japanese firm already make effort area (chart 9). r&d 7 expenditure past year push largely investment automobile-related industries. the increase reflect move toward advance case technology -- connected, autonomous, share & service, electric -- automobile response digitalization. the progress firms' effort desirable particularly term enhance japan's growth potential. let give two reason case. first, since labor supply likely decrease along decline age population japan, substitution it investment employment rather positive effects. regard impact it investment economy, raise concern employment opportunity lose number unemployed may increase. however, japan, negative impact decline labor force economic growth offset it investment compensate future decline labor supply. second, overall productivity enhance advance digitalization. on point, argue that, among general-purpose technologies, productivity improvement effect bring it computer internet small bring electricity internal-combustion engines. such pessimistic view it present by, example, professor robert gordon northwestern university, various counterargument this. erik brynjolfsson, professor massachusetts institute technology, note innovation occur connect variety exist product ideas, state it general-purpose technology lead innovation easily compare electricity internal-combustion engines, enable connection brand-new product idea networks. give development cutting-edge apply technology artificial intelligence (ai) internet thing (iot) underway, i suppose innovation bring advance digitization improve productivity, evaluate favorable. on basis, firm make use technology also important order strengthen growth potential it investment. accord survey ask japanese u.s. firm increase it-related budgets, many japanese firm answer 8 2013 survey improve business efficiency cut cost (chart 10). on hand, u.s. firm seem focus so-called aggressive investment, aim incorporate new technology encourage innovative initiative develop product services. although already contrast japanese u.s. firms, significant change observe 2017 survey. that is, japanese firm also start make active use technology enhance value-added innovation, rather utilize cut cost streamline production processes. since japanese firm good make process innovation, i hope proceed current innovations, thereby raise productivity. in order foster various innovation firms, essential promote basic research support (chart 11). for example, "the number highly cite papers," proxy indicator basic research, unfortunately much small japan countries. provide sufficient fund may important raise level research. on point, addition financial support government, hop flow fund industry university boosted. although statistic show proportion firm provide university r&d fund relatively small japan countries, japanese firm collaborate university propose research topic them. statistic organisation economic co-operation development (oecd) show r&d fund japan small compare countries. i expect promotion collaboration among industry, academia, government raise potential basic research japan future, turn boost growth potential overall economy. cycle wage price i move second virtuous cycle. a i say earlier, increase corporate profit lead rise wages, enable firms' sell price -- is, general price -- rise, result increase corporate profits. in order corporate profit increase sustainable manner, important virtuous cycle wage price continue operate. 9 after introduction qqe 2013, practice base pay increases, lose deflation, continue six consecutive year (chart 12). in situation, positive inflation rate take hold japan's economy already long deflation. that said, virtuous cycle wage increase price rise still lack strength. one reason behind that, due long experience severe employment situation deflation, labor management come prioritize stability long-term employment wage increases, behavior deeply entrench even wage start rising. the lack strength virtuous cycle also attributable fact firm absorb upward pressure cost personnel expense raise productivity, moderately pass cost increase sell prices. some might think raise wage sell price amid situation severe competition viable option. however, realize economy wage price rise moderately beneficial viewpoint corporate management well. let raise two points. first, give difficult general low level nominal wages, room reduce wage growth rate, easy firm adjust labor cost event economic downturn. i mention early that, japan, stability employment prioritize wage increase prolong deflation. however, empirical analysis suggest that, exclude extreme case, difficult firm low level nominal wages, economic terms, downward rigidity nominal wages. provide wage growth inflation zero situation economic activity neither accelerate decelerates, choice cut employment low wage order adjust labor cost economic downturn. however, wage growth inflation sufficiently positive, firm adjust real labor cost low wage growth rate. in relation this, economist jam tobin argue positive inflation act "grease wheels" labor market. second, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent advance economy lead stability foreign exchange rate long-term perspective. this base idea purchase power parity, whereby long-term trend 10 nominal exchange rate determine difference inflation compare countries. in fact, price difference japan country shrink positive inflation rate take hold japan, nominal exchange rate stable long-term perspective. such stability foreign exchange rate contribute corporate management stability overall economy. thus, moderate rise wage price beneficial firm well. in addition, i mention earlier, order corporate profit increase sustainable manner, necessary maintain virtuous cycle overall economy price rise moderately along wage increases. in fact, past data suggest wage price generally move tandem average, rise one usually occur. although i say virtuous cycle wage increase inflation still lack strength, positive change observe recently (chart 13). households' tolerance price rise increased, albeit moderately, back improvement employment income situation, see continue base pay rises. under circumstances, firms' stance shift toward raise prices. a price-setting stance firm closely relate consumption, output price di consumption-related industry show proportion enterprises, include small ones, answer output price rise continue exceed proportion answer price fallen, gap expanding, albeit moderate pace. in economy price stability target 2 percent achieved, labor productivity rise around 1 percent, japan's economy present, wage growth rate would around 3 percent; is, 2 percent inflation plus 1 percent labor productivity. on point, minimum wage raise around 3 percent four consecutive year 2016. i hope firms' stance continue shift toward raise wage price favorable economic environment, virtuous cycle wage price gain strength. 11 conclusion a almost time, i would like conclude speech. today, i talk detail challenge sustain virtuous cycle japan's economy viewpoint expectation firms. i also touch importance (1) firm continue positive investment, lead enhance productivity, order raise economic growth potential (2) make firms' stance shift toward raise wage price strengthen virtuous cycle wage prices. next year, olympic paralympic game hold tokyo. the previous tokyo game host 1964, back then, japan full energy period high economic growth. look back year, series historical event boost people's confidence, join oecd april well launch tokaido bullet train host olympic game october. on hand, economic expansion last two years, dub olympics boom, peak october 1964 japan's economy experience downturn year thereafter. from experience, worry economic activity second half next year, need pessimistic. japan's economy improve significantly, virtuous cycle operating. corporate activities, remain cautious, steadily become vigorous. the bank continue firmly fulfill responsibility central bank achieve price stability target japan's economy grow sustainable manner virtuous cycle economy. i would like close speech express sincere hope year 2020 wonderful one you. thank attention. december 26, 2019haruhiko kurodagovernor bank japantoward

steadiness havebeen cornerstone europe’s crisis response economic recovery.i feel grateful humble give chance part effort.i would like thank former president mario draghi, executive board govern councilcolleagues, staff great institution friendship trust. and i would like wish isabelschnabel fabio panetta best luck.the start point remark morning people’s sense frustration criticism centralbanks fail deliver inflation consistent aim.this criticism take different form society.professional observer financial market participant often criticise inadequate size actionsand question

while three four euro area citizen thinkthe single currency good european union two three think good country, lessthan half citizen trust ecb.[2]in remark morning, i would like make two point speak concerns.the first contradiction inflation low monetary policy effective.central bank achieve great success recent years. their achievements, however, bemy second point, little avail public recognise understand them.i argue “veil effectiveness” create enormous challenge credibility acceptanceof central bank – challenge overcome revisit appropriateness four keycomponents heart current monetary policy frameworks: define price stability, wemeasure inflation, evaluate credibility intention range counterpart throughwhich implement monetary policy.low inflation effectiveness monetary policymy first point – square low inflation policy effectiveness – centre two separate questions. !"#$18.12.19, 15:52seite 1 von 8 how we, central bank community, evaluate effectiveness actions? and why,despite year extraordinary policy support, inflation remain stubbornly low?evaluating action surprisingly difficult.there handbook, checklist use consistently grade actions. ultimately, course,there one yardstick measure central bank effectiveness: track record deliveringinflation consistent aim.but inflation fail converge aim mechanically imply action beeneffective?my answer clear “no”.despite unprecedented challenge monetary policy implementation, central bank succeed indelivering financial monetary condition exceptionally supportive real economic activity.many euro area firm currently borrow financial market negative rates. bank lend rates, alsofor small medium-sized firms, currently at, close to, historical lows, little dispersion acrossmajor economies.firms respond incentive economic theory would predict.over past five years, real investment expand fast pace five year precedingthe global financial crisis. this small achievement consider persistent uncertainty hasweighed sentiment recent years.investment, turn, boost job creation. employment 7% compare mid-2014. and inmany euro area country wage grow fast pace many years.all all, ecb staff estimate show that, without policy actions, euro area real gdp would beenup 2.7 percentage point low end last year, inflation would half apercentage point low every year past four years.[3]explaining low inflationsuch counterfactuals – base wide range model – important proof policy beeneffective along full chain transmission – financial market price economic activity fromthe real side nominal side.for everything know policy propagate economy, inflation today would besignificantly weak absence actions, maybe even dangerously close deflation.but counterfactuals far complex lend true credibility action outside narrowcircle.they still raise question policy support fail promote robust convergence ofinflation level would allow normalisation policy – would allow graduate instrumentsthat cause mistrust concern.there two broad hypothesis might case.the first policy wrongly calibrate – is, slack large widely assumed, andpolicy even accommodative.true, output gap elusive concept never become gauge conduct publicpolicy, may large thought.[4]and broad measure unemployment include, example, involuntary part-time work remain wellabove headline unemployment.but measure long high crisis.i would also dismiss assertion relationship output inflation break down. aplethora empirical study prove phillips curve alive well.[5]18.12.19, 15:52seite 2 von 8 the second, view plausible, explanation phillips curve shift inward overtime – is, inflation today may low every level output gap.such shift typically relate persistent slow-moving change supply side economies,where monetary policy le traction. a such, difficult detect, even difficult toprove, particular coincide weak aggregate demand.but collectively impact wage price inflation difficult dismiss.[6]just consider structural change global energy market shale oil revolution effectivelyput ceiling oil price increase responsiveness oil supply demand shocks.[7]think secular decline wage bargain power contribute significant part recentproductivity gain long distribute labour, adverse consequence real disposableincomes, consumption growth and, ultimately, inflation.[8]or consider salient impact digitalisation price power brick mortar firms, mayhave contributed, least part, recent decline pass-through high wage cost toconsumer prices.[9]add shock effect ageing, rise service broad effect globalisation andit hard conclude combination shock likely put lid inflation inrecent years, shock likely constrain price pressure also near future.[10]none necessarily bad news.many shock fact benign, sense potential ultimately liftproductivity real wage pave way low-carbon economy. central bank clearly need tostep research model capacity understand joint impact.[11]but happen – pace depend lot broad economic policy framework, iwon’t discus morning[12] – central bank likely navigate low-growth, low-inflationenvironment risk repeatedly fail deliver inflation line aim.monetary policy low-inflation environmentwhat, then, can, should, central bank environment?let propose four element future reflection: define price stability, treat inflationexpectations, measure inflation implement monetary policy.some proposal far-reaching others.but share one aim: bring monetary policy close people – dismantle veil effectivenessand foster acceptance policy instrument often use scapegoat forshortcomings deficiency elsewhere public policy apparatus.rethinking definition price stabilityconsider first ecb’s definition price stability inflation rate “below, close to, 2%”.a simple answer current challenge would low inflation aim.if dissection current inflation driver vaguely right track, clear strategywould wrong many levels.it would misjudge current low-inflation episode permanent thereby dismiss lesson ofhistory slow pace diffusion new technologies.[13] it would create perilous time-consistencychallenges central bank inflation eventually transition new steady state.and would shift disproportionate share macroeconomic adjustment burden onto worker as,even today, shock euro area economy would accommodate loweringnominal wages. not best way foster support europe single currency!18.12.19, 15:52seite 3 von 8 raise aim similarly misguided. why raise aim fail achieve first place?i come debate different angle.if communicate aim maintain inflation at, say, 1.9%, surprise thepublic expect u control inflation first decimal point.it significantly raise bar maintain credibility monetary policy, particularly give littlethe public actually know inflation monetary policy.[14]we need dismantle absurd idea omnipotent central bank mechanically steer inflation.the ecb clarify aim deliver inflation 2% medium term.and could communicate range inflation outcome consider acceptable normaltimes.such tolerance band, le precise, invitation inaction complacency.research show central bank strong incentive already respond inflation deviation withinthe tolerance zone, rather wait inflation cross edges.[15] and convincingevidence tolerance band weaken anchor role midpoint.[16]it rather recognise large inherent uncertainty surround price wage decisions, convey thisuncertainty general public elect representative establish consistency themedium-term horizon ecb’s strategy.for change effective, however, two element critical.first, ecb would need communicate midpoint broad public. a recent surveyin unite state show quarter respondent household know federal reserve’s2% inflation aim.[17]and, second, ecb would need establish clear track record emphasis centrality themidpoint conduct policy. the 2% need remain clear nominal anchor coordinatingboth expectation actions.which inflation expectation matter?the second element review relate evaluate expect deviation themidpoint target.[18]critics would dismiss idea tolerance band around inflation aim fear that, bysignalling comfort range inflation rate 2%, would entrench expectation lowinflation risk downplay nominal anchor.i two comment response fears.the first long ignore fact medium-term inflation expectation bothprofessional forecaster financial market participant persistently adjust lower. adaptiveexpectations rational time deep structural change.[19]my second comment really question: expectation central bank consider whenevaluating risk inflation outlook?neither academic community central bank community ever provide answer thisquestion. i see large gap role play inflation expectation profession theextent central banks’ actual knowledge expectation ultimately affect inflation outcome andwhich expectation concerned.market-based measure convenient readily available. but convenience may provedelusive.household inflation expectations, example, find good proxy firms’ pricing18.12.19, 15:52seite 4 von 8 decision professional forecaster financial market participants.[20]but expectation household point different direction recent times, paint muchless dire picture regard inflation outlook. accord one survey, household believe annualeuro area inflation 2004 2018 close 9%, fact 1.6%.[21]does consumer price index need changed?the third element relate way measure inflation.the harmonise index consumer price (hicp) tremendous achievement term ofproviding reliable, timely comparable measure consumer inflation across eu member states.but whether adequately

mainly actual rentals, weight 6.5%.the cost owner-occupied housing, contrast, include even though 65% ofhouseholds euro area main residence.[22]careful reflection warrant allow wedge persist inflation householdsperceive rate officially measure undermine validity actions.rethinking central banks’ toolkitre-evaluating appropriateness three element – inflation aim, role inflationexpectations inflation measurement – would probably go long way towards revitalise policy linewith current challenges.but may enough.if current environment persistently low underlie inflation elevate uncertainty persistwell future – risk may – odds large firm social partnerswill increasingly start adjust price wage accordingly.in case, forceful policy action would needed.one option would same.i doubt ecb ease finance condition deploy current instruments.but one may doubt whether approach would effective bring inflation close aimthan far. and one may wonder far depth shallow capital market besounded, whether side effect measure would outweigh benefit point inthe future.a second possible, complementary, option coordinate economic policy closely.the combination limit fiscal policy space many euro area countries, political fixation large fiscalsurpluses some, persistent opposition common fiscal capacity make option lesscredible, however.coordination fiscal authority cannot fig leaf central bank inaction inability act. and itcan easily degenerate threat central bank independence.but central bank one key strength, agility.they always able reinvent themselves, innovate overcome even severe impedimentsto transmission.and transmission financial market bank hit wall – third stage transmissionremains anaemic – central bank obvious choice consider whether broaden setof counterparties implement monetary policy.18.12.19, 15:52seite 5 von 8 the discussion central bank digital currency case point.at heart discussion question whether central bank grant general publicdirect access balance sheets. this question come many thorny technological choice andpolicy challenges, particular regard financial stability future credit intermediation, aswe know.[23]but assume challenge overcome, reason central banks,within mandate, apply set instrument account private individual thatthey currently apply bank – is, charge interest rate central bank digital money.[24]by go heart consumer choices, approach would likely effective fast instimulating demand inflation, could le negative side effects. rather address thesymptoms low inflation, would amount precision surgery euler equation.none say would trivial.ultimately, central bank would need weigh cost benefit – like otherunconventional policy measures. what avoid, however, restrict toolkit dogmaticreasons intellectual convenience, give ability

climate-related role financial sector. it obvious climate change, associate global warming, all-encompassing concern translate initiative range supranational scope possible local level. in view one issue affect every one u and, time, planet whole. the fight climate change traditionally top-down process. the start point always international agreement transpose supranational national regulations; currently witness strong bottom-up movement occur parallel top-down process. people, particular young, increasingly demand government act immediately decisively, even affect life pockets. another reveal feature movement effort undertake jointly public private sectors. many official initiative currently way collaboration private sector. for instance, eu high-level group sustainable finance, create commission december 2016 provide advice contribute implementation clean policies, comprise 20 senior expert civil society, finance sector, academia observer european international institutions. the may say task force climate-related financial disclosures, (tcfd). this task force, form 31 member entirely industry, create december 2015 request fsb develop voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosure use company provide information investors, lenders, insurer stakeholders. these disclosure standard increasingly use company around world. the emergence so-called “green bonds” another case point. these bond create response official initiative; indeedthe market base entirely private standards, green bond principle (gbp) issue icma 2014. obviously, green bond market grow follow demand private investor will “put money mouth is”. in regard investors, corporates client demand information impact business activity environment. this important eu finally agree common taxonomy which, hopefully, endorse european parliament, allow comprehensive assessment risk enhance transparency. in sum, fight climate change clearly solely publicly drive initiative. it long official sector preach rest society rather joint effort stakeholders: governments, central banks, supervisor official institutions, along corporates, financial institution and, ultimately, individuals. 3/5 i say stakeholder because, come planet, everybody live stakeholder. i believe groundbreaking because, issue global one, tendency go precisely direction. it easy dilute personal corporate responsibilities, find excuse carry without change anything substantial. the message receive time look excuses. the write wall: time action. of course, whatever person, municipality, region even country combat fight global climate change quite futile rest world stay same. but message today u must bit, large small, without look others might might doing. i today, precisely, talk “our bit”. the contribution financial sector make global struggle silver bullet, important one. it clear finance regard pollute sector. that, least, positive development difficult time banks´ reputation. traditionally, company dependent oil product affect environmental regulation result international agreements. in fact, admit financial sector’s involvement battle rather limited. until recently, climate change see something outside remit. this change result 2015 paris agreement. what change since 2015 warrant sudden interest part bank regulator supervisor climate risks? first, 2015, paris agreement stress first time importance financial system steer resource need transform economy towards sustainable model. second, 2018, first ngf report state climate-related risk source financial risk, supervisor central bank shore system’s solvency face risks. both elements, risk funding, clearly interrelated. let´s start risk view. in public intervention i keep highlight one essential feature viable business model, namely need identify quantify cost risk involve give transaction pas price capital. it well know process transition entail two type risk financial system: (i) one hand, physical risk cause direct effect climate change, result gradual increase temperature, frequent severe climate event storms, flood natural disasters; (ii) other, transition risks, refer potential effect specific bank borrower regulatory measure aim sustainably transform economy, technological changes, change customer behaviour preference drive great environmental awareness. this lead second element: contribution bank transition economy. of course, bank incorporate climate-related risk cost capital, indirectly become “facilitators” change, reduce cost finance activity 4/5 contribute sustainable transformation economy, time discourage pollute activities. at time, stress change production model also entail opportunity economic agents, bank company seize. by way example, achieve eu's 2030 target agree paris, estimate that, eu whole, need fill investment gap estimate 260 billion eur per year. the cost clean technology decrease dramatically –both solar panel battery around 80% cheap decade ago, instance – potential term growth job creation also striking. in regard, technology, society, regulation public opinion align bring change towards sustainable economic model. bank should, time, nurture change exploit business opportunity stem it. nevertheless, mindful potentially systemic implication move decarbonise economy entails, could affect specific economic sectors. the official sector must ass process carefully drive movement gradually wish minimise undesirable economic social consequences. the goal achieve dub “a fair transition”. let talk supervisor’s side. what expect bank relation risks? well, short medium term would expect bank include environmental dimension strategic approach, well risk analysis monitoring. bank must begin fill data gaps, compile relevant information least new operations. from methodological standpoint, bank least able understand implication environmental risk may affect business models, include risk appetite frameworks, manner proportionate size complexity. of course, board duly informed, member necessary expertise ass risks. needle say, bank need “catch up”; also work banco de españa adapt reality. i believe fair acknowledge new everyone bank sector, include certainly central bank supervisors. what doing? firstly, create internal function entrust assess impact institution environment. the aim identify coordinate necessary measure reduce impact. secondly, macroprudential supervisor, clearly need able ass quantify risk transition towards sustainable economy poses, individual bank financial sector whole. we must able perform stress test financial system overall define scenario apply bank individually. 5/5 accordingly, design internal governance structure methodologies, actively participate cultural shift ssm supervisory model. naturally, also evaluate information data requirement need address challenge. thirdly, investor debt markets, work include environmental risk assessment credit analysis. a fourth key element responsibility supervisors. we must foster implementation change financial sector. we cannot wait change occur. we need proactive. accordingly, also launch several initiative help raise awareness importance issue, include workshop meet industry learn sector cop climate change promote transformation. there certainly much done. but, conclude positive note, i want highlight incredible pace initiative move change introduced. let give two examples. first, ngf create barely two year ago, short lifespan manage publish two comprehensive reports, guidance central banks’ investment and, least, membership surge 8 51 member 12 observers. the second example rather obvious: look composition topic discuss panel today. they would quite unthinkable two year ago. thank much. japan's economy monetary policy speech meet business leader okayama bank japan december 12, 2019 masayoshi amamiya deputy governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction it pleasure opportunity today exchange view administrative, financial, business leader okayama prefecture. i would like take chance express sincere gratitude cooperation activity bank japan's okayama branch. yesterday, i look recovery area severely damage heavy rain july 2018, mabicho. it heartbreaking see impact disaster remain even year half passed. however, time, encourage know local make steady progress toward recovery. i would like express deep respect everyone's efforts. before exchange view you, i would like talk bank japan's view development economic activity prices, include global economy, underlie think monetary policy conduct. in particular, let explain focus three question i receive often recently: long global economic slowdown continue; whether affect domestic demand; degree consumption tax hike's impact. i. financial economic development i start talk development global economy. let first look back development past year (chart 1). from 2017 mid-2018, global economy firm, support mainly global growth it-related demand, resultant boost business fix investment, steady domestic demand country. since around mid-2018, however, global growth rate world trade volume declined, mainly reflect heighten uncertainty u.s.-china trade friction adjustment global cycle it-related good affect weak demand data center smartphones. in particular, world trade volume start decrease middle year. the characteristic current slowdown global economy manufacture sector relatively weak background slowdown trade activity (chart 2). business sentiment manufacture sector globally remain state deterioration. in situation, machinery investment 2 remain somewhat weak. in addition, global automobile sale somewhat weak due various factor weak corporate demand, also observe machinery investment, effect strict environmental regulations, tighten financial condition emerge economies. there use prevail view global economy would head toward pick-up 2019, pick-up turn delayed, many institutions, include international monetary fund (imf) bank japan, revise downward projection global economic growth. the delay mainly attributable intensify prolong u.s.-china trade friction continue decline growth rate chinese economy. so, long global economic growth pace continue deceleration phase? in words, global economy pick up? the bank project that, although subject considerable uncertainties, growth rate rise moderately mid-2020. accord late world economic outlook (weo) release imf, global growth rate 2019 project decline 3.0 percent thereafter recover 3.4 percent 2020, around past average (chart 1). one mechanism global economy pick materialization effect country's macroeconomic policy. since begin year, many emerge commodity-exporting economy reduce policy rates. a advance economies, federal reserve cut policy rate three consecutive meet hold july october, view prevent actual slowdown economic activity price due risk concern weak global growth, well trade developments. the european central bank (ecb) also conduct monetary ease september. these accommodative monetary policy measure likely support pick-up global economy stabilize economic price development country. at federal open market committee (fomc) hold morning, federal reserve decide change policy. a background decision, federal reserve point projection "insurance" rate cut past month likely underpin u.s. economy. 3 another drive force pick-up global economy recovery global cycle it-related goods, trigger current global economic slowdown (chart 3). the global demand semiconductor bottom out, demand smartphones data center likely pick up. in addition, somewhat longer-term perspective, demand relate 5g network expect increase globally. in situation, phase inventory reduction almost end japan, increase export production it-related good start seen. moreover, regard u.s.-china trade friction, entail large uncertainty global economy, negotiation seem continue toward progress even unite state postpone impose additional tariff chinese good october. global financial market take development favorable, investors' risk sentiment improve compare ago. if globally stable trade relationship rebuilt, boost global trade, shrunk. although sign pick-up global economy start observe gradually, uncertainty outlook continue warrant attention bank cautious future developments. the u.s.-china trade negotiation show positive developments, point disagreement two country remain various aspects, i say uncertainty outcome negotiation still high. in addition, close attention pay various risks, include development emerge economy china, exit european union (eu) turn unite kingdom, general election go take place today, geopolitical risks. a outlook, firm keep pay attention risk concern global economy prolong period, could take long expect fix investment stance become active again. thus, downside risk concern global economy continue warrant close attention. thus far, i talk development global economy. now, i would like move japan's economic developments. the growth pace global economy remain slow, affect japan's economy, mainly manufacture export-related industry (chart 4). since turn year, manufacturers' sentiment 4 japan become clearly cautious. with regard export production activity, weakness continue observed, particularly capital good use business fix investment automobile-related goods. a outlook, development likely continue time pick-up global economy delayed. what unique current phase that, contrast somewhat weak external demand, domestic demand firm (chart 5). in past, large economic fluctuation often occur japan, negative impact manufacture sector stem change global economy spread domestic demand. in current phase, however, although export continue show weakness, domestic demand continue increase three sector -- is, corporate, household, public sectors. thus, impact global economic slowdown domestic demand limit far. the bank expect that, virtuous cycle income spend operating, domestic demand follow uptrend impact global economic slowdown domestic demand remain limited. that is, although momentum domestic demand likely decelerate temporarily short run, reflect effect global economic slowdown consumption tax hike, expect large decline avoided. in follows, i explain outlook business fix investment, private consumption, public investment detail. let start business fix investment. business fix investment japan continue increase trend whole, although somewhat weak globally. this attributable increase sustain investment le susceptible short-term economic development (chart 6). such investment include labor-saving investment reflect tight labor market conditions. while labor market condition remain tight labor shortage expect continue long-term perspective, demand save labor improve efficiency increased, mainly nonmanufacturing sector labor intensive. since okayama prefecture, active job openings-to-applicants ratio rank top three japan, face extremely tight labor market conditions, may recognize situation clearly. in industry face labor shortage -- include retail, accommodation well eat drink services, construction -- firm make effort save labor improve efficiency 5 actively undertake machinery software investment. in addition, uptrend research development (r&d) investment growth area expect maintained. with view improve competitiveness long-term perspective, pace increase r&d investment plan maintain industry automobile chemicals, recently affect global economic slowdown. moreover, construction investment also maintain high level, reflect wide range demand, urban redevelopment projects, construction distribution facility result spread e-commerce, construction accommodation facility aim capture inbound tourism demand. although business fix investment japan whole uptrend, effect global economic slowdown actually see part (chart 7). let u take example machinery investment manufacture sector. in particular, machinery investment industry relate capital good use fix investment automobile somewhat weak recently. while i mention early export production industry greatly affect global economic slowdown, thing say business fix investment. a outlook, business fix investment expect maintain uptrend average underpin sustain investment; short run, however, pace increase project decelerate, mainly machinery investment manufacture sector, pick-up global economy delayed. next, i talk private consumption. private consumption increase moderately, albeit fluctuation mainly result effect consumption tax hike, employment income situation continue improve steadily. regard development private consumption time being, key effect tax hike october, relate third question i mention outset (chart 8). first, look development consumption prior tax hike, september, tax hike, significant increase demand, so-called front-loaded increase demand, household electrical appliance televisions, daily necessities, high-end product include luxury goods. however, since increase demand significant august, overall front-loaded increase demand constrain time compare previous tax hike, increase observe quite long period. next, let u take look 6 development tax hike. attention need pay fact become difficult grasp underlie trend consumption due downward pressure result effect natural disaster typhoon october. in fact, consumption-related statistic since october show somewhat large decline, seem partly affect special factor i mentioned. assess comprehensively exclude factor take account perception relevant industries, reactionary decline demand tax hike far seem significant previous tax hike. in addition, downward pressure private consumption highly likely small previous tax hike, underpin government's various support measure households. that said, attention continue pay effect tax hike, could change depend on, example, people's sentiment price developments. lastly, let move public investment. last year, heavy rain affect western japan, include okayama prefecture, earthquake hokkaido cause disastrous damage. there also great damage cause series natural disaster year, several typhoon hit mainly eastern japan. in affect areas, progress make construction project relate restoration reconstruction. in addition, construction relate national resilience -- aim strengthen ability maintain function infrastructure even natural disaster occur -- implement intensively across country fiscal 2020. in okayama prefecture, part urgent flood control project mabicho, construction underway oda river, cause severe damage time heavy rain last year. moreover, economic policy measure decide government ago include initiative promote restoration reconstruction recent natural disaster well strengthen framework disaster prevention. a development show, public investment expect increase. to summarize i talk far, regard outlook japan's economy, export production project continue show weakness time being, pick-up global economy delayed. a domestic demand, pace increase expect decelerate temporarily due effect global economic 7 slowdown consumption tax hike. however, somewhat longer-term perspective, expect domestic demand remain firm that, project imf, global economic growth rate rise. thus, japan's economy likely continue expand trend, albeit moderate pace. ii. price development next, i explain price development japan (chart 9). look back long-term perspective, many year start late 1990s, japan's economy deflation term sustain decline prices. reflect situation, bank introduce quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) 2013, since pursue powerful monetary easing. at present, japan's economy long deflation, sense sustain decline prices, economy improve significantly positive annual cpi inflation take hold. turn recent price developments, year-on-year rate change cpi exclude fresh food remain around 0.5 percent, partly due effect past decline crude oil price reduction mobile-related prices. the cpi continue show relatively weak development compare economic expansion tight labor market conditions. this mainly mindset behavior base assumption wage price increase easily deeply entrench among firm households, due experience prolong low growth deflation. under circumstances, consumption tax rate raise october. the key point look future price development whether firms' price-setting stance change result tax hike. i would like show two distinctive example (chart 10). the first concern development price durable goods. a good television household electrical appliances, increase reactionary decline demand prior tax hike observed. price somewhat strong tax hike, demand increased. however, price-setting mix since tax hike, demand decline reaction increase. whereas year-on-year rate change price television laptop -- relatively large price fluctuation -- turn negative since tax hike, rate increase price durable household good refrigerator vacuum clean remain relatively high level. the 8 second example concern development price service dining-out. in case service prices, confirm tax hike pass steadily. while consumption tax rate dining-out raise 10 percent, rate food products, include ready-made meal deli food, unchanged 8 percent due introduction reduce tax rate. for reason, point tax hike might fully pass dining-out prices, reflect price competition ready-made meals, dining-out price exclude consumption tax could weaken. however, look development price october, appear tax hike pass almost completely. although dining-out industry make effort save labor improve efficiency response increase personnel expense distribution costs, move gradually pas cost increase cannot absorb efforts. this suggest many din out-related firm pass tax hike sell prices. these move also observe services. of course, attention need pay fact firms' price-setting behavior may change depend future development consumption. however, major change price-setting stance observe far seem firm continue pas cost include consumption tax. take account situation, i explain bank's view outlook prices. for time being, likely year-on-year rate change energy price remain negative due effect past decline crude oil prices, thereby push cpi. however, somewhat longer-term perspective, bank project inflation rate rise gradually, firms' households' perception price improve situation economy continue expand trend. while expect still take time achieve price stability target 2 percent, inflation rate likely increase gradually toward 2 percent. one assume important mechanism achievement price rise output gap economy whole (chart 11). look output gap, show balance aggregate demand supply, positive gap take hold past years, demand exceed supply. base outlook economic activity i mention earlier, although output gap likely narrow temporarily within positive territory, mainly due effect global economic slowdown consumption tax hike, expect remain around 9 current level average. under circumstances, households' tolerance price rise increases, reflect rise wages, firms' stance shift toward raise prices, firms' move pas cost increase active move raise price reflect development demand likely widespread. with wage price continue rise, deeply entrench mindset behavior among people base assumption wage price increase easily expect change gradually; accordingly, inflation expectation -- is, people's expectation future price development -- project rise. a development show, bank recognize momentum toward achieve price stability target maintained, whereby positive output gap result increase actual price rise inflation expectations, lead gradual rise inflation rate. iii. the bank's conduct monetary policy next, i would like explain bank's conduct monetary policy. the bank conduct "qqe yield curve control," aim achieve price stability target 2 percent (chart 12). it pursue powerful monetary easing; specifically, bank set short-term policy interest rate minus 0.1 percent target level 10-year japanese government bond (jgb) yield around zero percent, conduct large-scale jgb purchase market. the bank consider that, present, downside risk economic activity prices, mainly regard development global economy, require attention. a i mention earlier, various downside risk surround global economy. if materialization risk lead long delay time pick-up global economic growth pace deceleration global economy, japan's economy inevitably affected. in case, price could affect extent downward pressure output gap, one important factor determine price developments. base recognition, since july, bank clearly show policy stance tilt toward monetary accommodation. in october, bank clarify stance maintain present level policy rate or, depend situation, low present levels, long downside risk remain significantly 10 high, current situation. the bank consider downside risk economic activity prices, mainly regard development global economy, continue warrant close monitoring, thus policy stance tilt toward monetary accommodation appropriate time being. it continue carefully examine various risk hesitate take additional ease measure great possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target lost. so far, i talk bank's basic stance monetary policy conduct. in conduct, bank consider important take account effect side effect monetary policy, include financial market function financial intermediation. on point, recognize prolong downward pressure financial institutions' profits, low interest rate environment severe competition among financial institution continuing, could create risk gradual pullback financial intermediation destabilize financial system. although risk judge significant point, mainly financial institution sufficient capital bases, bank continue examine risk well consider relevant conduct monetary policy pursue conduct appropriate manner, take account development economic activity price well financial conditions. conclusion lastly, i would like say word okayama prefecture's economy. okayama prefecture's economy moderate expand trend back firm domestic demand. while u.s.-china trade friction well relatively weak development chinese economy affect export production, business fix investment remain high level. private consumption pick-up trend, although fluctuation demand result consumption tax hike observed. despite severe damage cause heavy rain last year, okayama prefecture's economy maintain virtuous expansionary cycle support hard work residents, firms, local government. 11 bless favorable climate earn name "the land sunshine," okayama prefecture develop commerce logistics root history transportation hub. it manufacture industries, exemplify mizushima coastal industrial zone, drive force japanese manufacturing. moreover, prefecture rich culture, show many ancient castles, bizen ware, korakuen, kurashiki bikan historical quarter, well natural bless hot springs, fruits, delight setouchi, appeal visitor japan abroad. the promotion tourism base attraction make progress, "okayama art summit" "setouchi triennale" hold year, many people japan country visit okayama prefecture. on hand, despite riches, okayama prefecture similar region address decline age population. however, think ahead use insight, people okayama seem overcome various challenge different times. during edo period, feudal ikeda clan, kojima bay reclaim agricultural productivity dramatically improved. in meiji period, magosaburo ohara introduce late technology time lay foundation development textile industry set factory provide work environment line today's think work-style reforms. thereafter, scar war remaining, development scheme mizushima launch 1952, industrial complex emerge play lead role development japan's manufacture industry. recently, promotion regional development center forestry north prefecture bear fruit become model regional revitalization nationwide. i hope growth potential okayama prefecture enhance collaborative effort people well firm local government build prefecture's strengths, see cooperation aim overcome damage cause heavy rain. the bank, particular okayama branch, seek play part contribute development okayama prefecture's economy. thank attention.

sector purchase programme (pspp), europe’s “quantitativeeasing”, reactivate 13 september follow majority decision governingcouncil. several ecb member also vote against, governor thegerman, austrian dutch central bank openly criticise decision. whathappened?in september, euro area face risk slowdown inflation wasremaining far away 2% objective. the entire govern council agree thisdiagnosis – debate need act, choice instruments. someof u convince relaunching asset purchase suitable instrument,because long-term interest rate never low. it’s normal differentpoints view, decision taken, accept move on. in fact,that’s one ecb’s great quality – take decision simple majority, make itmore reactive european institutions. not everyone agreement, althoughit’s good give decision weight.a technical debate nevertheless result open intense confrontation…sabine resign combination personal reasons, comment them.another relevant topic communication. i think institution take decision,whatever personal opinion defend decision. thing would different thevotes public, something i’ve always supported. each individual would takeresponsibility vote explain interest euro area – nationalcentral bank governor sit frankfurt personal capacity support collectiveinterest, country’s.since start euro area crisis 2010, bundesbank routinely votedagainst ecb’s decisions, criticise publicly, even join legal action againstit…the govern council almost unanimous agreement measure take duringthe crisis necessary within ecb’s mandate. i’m think particularly thedecision outright monetary transaction (omts) take september 2012 protectthe euro area speculation could force country single currency.that decision almost unanimous; single vote come president thebundesbank, think operation cross line separate monetary fiscalpolicy design support euro area country’s bond market attackfrom markets. this opinion govern council, spend entiresummer 2012 ensure line would cross – therefore make ourintervention conditional activation european stability mechanism (esm) adjustmentprogramme. that essential, mean ecb reform country’seconomy get country’s public finance back foot ask help – thecountry within framework esm programme. then ecb canprovide liquidity enable bond market stabilise. moreover, european court ofjustice rule favour. 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech we seem witness real clash ideology leave right within theecb, zero-rates policy result “euthanisation rentier”, toborrow 19th century phrase, mean it’s hurt saver pensioners, hence thecriticism germany netherlands, help workers, growth, otherwords.it’s false dichotomy. one regret haven’t manage convince germanpublic merit policy. on one hand, monetary policy always everywhereaffects balance save consumption via interest rates. if didn’t that, wouldserve purpose! and hand, period unemployment skyrockets, growthslows threat deflation, case 2012 2014, normal theecb side employment. i concern here, it’s part mandate: withoutgrowth employment, cannot price stability. our policy interest euroarea whole, therefore germany, it’s simple that. a soon singlemarket single currency, there’s point artificially set interest different countriesagainst other, boat…your policy also weaken banks, see margin shrink thepoint long concern charge deposits.on one hand, interest rate low ecb. u low “key rates” (forexample, rate bank deposit hold ecb remunerated) low evennegative level mean save glut economy: natural rate interest hasfallen due weak growth, age population sort anxiety global economyleading demand safe assets, like government bonds. but monetary policy workand stimulate economy, interest rate set central bank thisequilibrium rate. if one want return situation save generate return andconditions supportive financial sector, criticise central bank achieve nothing.action need take fundamental boost return capital, would naturallylead interest rate increasing, central bank could follow.on hand, true fact yield curve flat, word interestrates low across maturity spectrum, weigh financial sector. indeed, thedifference long-term performance save short-term cost fund iscurrently almost zero. but weigh even heavily profitability europeanbanks cost base much high bank unite states,japan, unite kingdom scandinavia, that, certain countries, non-performing loan balance sheet long yield return. and finally, toomany bank europe consolidation started.so, need few bank euro area?the bank union hasn’t yet enable consolidation within sector. we need see cross-border m&a activity bank sector, also need overcome number obstaclesto bank activity. but bank union play useful role stabilise sector isnow much robust 2012, since ecb take role bankingsupervisor strengthen capital liquidity requirements. it important recognisethat one major achievement past eight year reduce influence ofthe bank lobby. the bank union put stop vicious triangle exist eachcountry big banks, regulator – words, finance ministry – thesupervisor, generally national central bank. we create distancebetween bank sector supervisor, good thing people europe.another effect monetary policy create condition new realestate bubble, since there’s long return savings. 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech there risk, we’re yet. there local tensions, nothing affect euroarea whole. prevent risk start national level – property price soaringin particular city, problem relate mortgage lend relate land-use planning?in latter case, certainly fall outside ecb’s purview. financial institution arefundamentally strong 2008, they’re good capitalise haveto comply strict rules, particularly come measure risks. for example,basel iii impose limit banks’ use internal model – previously, could calculatethemselves risk taking, make overconfident. that said, remainin environment low interest rate long time, risk real estate bubble ofcourse increase. i would like ecb develop approach allow good comparisonbetween benefit real economy low interest rate risk create thefinancial sector. at moment, it’s clear point risk start outweigh benefits.isn’t also need strengthen rule bank need observe whengranting loan?macroprudential tool offer scope tighten capital requirement bank conditionsthey impose borrower financial stability problem appear emerging. such measuresare take national level – france, example, high council financial stability,which chair finance minister, take measure relate lend large firmsand house loans. if ecb think country isn’t enough, take matter intoits hands. the european systemic risk board identify risk makerecommendations individual countries, ecb think doesn’t go far enough, itcan take charge impose additional requirement european level, something hasso far never done. the area tool exist – matter concern – non-bank activity. since financial crisis, shift towards non-bank sector.banks shrink balance sheet investment funds, money market fund assetmanagers continue grow effectively finance economy. so, investment fundbuys portfolio loan bank, become creditor firm households. yet ismuch le supervision few prudential tool sector. this major work beneeded come year – need develop macroprudential approach non-bankactivity credit condition tighten necessary.since start ecb january 2012, institution undergo afundamental transformation. it use much like bundesbank, actsmore like u federal reserve.the existential crisis go through, first spain italy summer 2012 withgreece summer 2015, action one man, mario draghi, president theecb november year, give u necessary maturity make full use theinstruments grant u treaties. doe mean become like federalreserve? in certain sense, yes, equip comprehensive toolbox tosupport euro area economy times, use tool like quantitative ease inspire usmodel, capacity intervene markets. but also significant differences.for start, don’t mandate – federal reserve dual mandate thatgives equal weight price stability full employment, ecb’s mandate prioritisesprice stability. and financial market – bond market unite statesare deep liquid, give federal reserve almost unlimited capacity forintervention. in europe, capital market union – bond market fragment across19 countries, limit capacity monetary policy.are proud accomplished?there three thing i take pride in. first, mario draghi’s speech july 2012, say thatthe ecb, within mandate, would whatever take preserve euro, creation 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech outright monetary transactions, concrete manifestation commitment andmade possible maintain integrity euro area. then episode withgreece, course controversial, see costa gavras film “adultsin room”. but greek government close bankruptcy, ensure thecontinued finance greek economy greek bank – lose access themarkets saver follow capital flight – respect political ofeuro area government assistance greece conditional. our actionsultimately allow greece remain euro. there want make ecbresponsible greece leave euro area, resist that! and third thing i’m proudof quantitative ease launch 2015, avert risk deflation.any regrets?we probably start quantitative ease (qe) little late, though i’m blame anyone. itwas major innovation require immense effort persuasion within governingcouncil. for example, long discussion would bear risk assetpurchases finally decide 80% would bear national central bank theirbalance sheet ecb. the idea prevent qe, massive purchase publicsecurities – hold almost third total european debt, equivalent 20% euro areagdp – way usher fiscal union back door wish ofmember states. we also underestimate impact policy fiscal austerity would haveon activity; policy enshrine treaty stability, coordination governance andwas necessary time order provide stability financial markets. but wouldhave require accommodative monetary policy, recommend imf, go asfar qe, run 2010 rather 2015. finally, mayhave sit fence slightly long regard climate change, even ourcore task. other central banks, bank england, become aware early wedid. for one, climate change need integrate financial sector supervision, take intoaccount risk pose certain sector activity financial securities, need toreflect consequence monetary policy. and error notof making: one reason deterioration crisis euro area laggedfar behind unite state clean financial sector. the european country weredeluding state bank late conduct seriousstress test impose recapitalisations. certain countries, include france, even foughtrearguard action avoid bolster large banks’ capital base. all weighedon growth. we need make sure don’t slip back again!christine lagarde announce lead review ecb’s strategy.christine lagarde right. it’s good idea step back lead discussion. i hope thatthe debate hold solely within ecb, independent economist civilsociety representative involve too.if look back euro fare since 1999, see produceall effect people hop for. trade euro area declining, capitalmarkets union limbo, country large capital surpluses, germany thenetherlands, invest unite state china, etc. in fact, countrythat gain euro germany, amply benefit euro’sundervaluation.everyone benefit euro exchange rate risk disappear financialconditions investment never favourable. likewise, euro common goodthat enable u speak one voice international scene, even don’t make enoughuse strength. but true create euro, back bankingunion european stability mechanism, enable single european market, fact 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech market standstill. why? because outset conceive space forthe free movement goods, whereas service economy singlemarket services.you cannot ignore northern european countries’ refusal offer financial solidarity.we political problem: european state single currency which, veryexistence, extraordinary expression solidarity. but tend see euro area toomuch club free membership, give right certain number services.however, participation euro bring duty solidarity neighbour goingthrough rough patch. while it’s true member state fulfil duty towards greece,ireland, portugal, cyprus spain, condition extremely costly, oreven toxic, political level. the adjustment programme generate huge tension andacrimony. and, conversely, need keep house order avoid create problemsfor neighbours. country whatever economic policy want, that’s democracy,but condition jeopardise neighbours. to end, member theclub need observe certain rules. in reality, however, country little regard rules.one day need create ad hoc institutions, include authority charge euro areabudget would embody collective interest, decision-making power beaccountable european parliament. for long place, tocross finger hope crisis occurs.so ecb make failure political will?yes. the lack coordination fiscal domain mean one thework. i dream euro area strong democratic political base, would alleviatethe burden ecb. . the politicisation ecb result weakness politicalpillar economic monetary union. some people accuse ecb much ofnot democratic enough, excessive expectation project onto ecb areflection political weakness.

have ever think would president central bank?no! never, i never think i would manage director imf, i never think iwould minister economy finance france, life like that.have already learn lingo ecb?i’m learning! i’m learn little bite german, i’m take lesson i’m constantly immerse incentral bank jargon concept attitude mind, i’m learn fast.you make clear press conference style.yes.but role? because every word say president theecb might instantly impact financial markets.well, first all, i like words. i tend attentive word i use, suit fine. andwhat i press conference, first one, i try warn journalist room andthe journalist observer behind screen take i nottry second-guess associate proceed analogy, analysis comparative workbecause would probably misguided. and i think trade-off i havesomething say, i say it. that’s style nature.yes, want make clear. you never lead central bank before. do thinkthat’s advantage disadvantage?having minister finance four years, middle financial crisis havingnavigated difficulty that, put place lot regulation still apply today tosanitise strengthen financial sector time, privilege lead theinternational monetary fund eight years, many instance lender last resort tocountries difficulty, i know facet work do here. i learn fast, i workhard i’m surround exceptionally competent people. so extent i cansometimes challenge conventional view sort home-grown conventionalwisdom, i think it’s healthy.yes, could advantage.it could be.you first woman lead ecb, use man’s world. how arepeople reacting?i think notice i think tolerate hopefully accept i good, ifnot good job men would. i think that’s beauty diversity openness thisinstitution, actually, accept, engage respect difference try include them. 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech do believe it’s important woman lead prominent institution likethe ecb?yes, i do, i see many young woman – necessarily young woman actually –but many colleague friend people i meet course everyday life,who look say say sometimes me, “about time womandoes job”, number 1. number 2, “if it, maybe i it, – thenmy daughter maybe it.” so i think signal it’s important. it honestly give me, iwould say, additional responsibility i don’t want let down. that put anadditional weight shoulders. i honour that.also european commission lead woman now. do think make adifference somehow?i’m sure will. when look photo day european union setup first place, look old photo – sometimes old photo – ecb,of govern council, make difference, optically. but i also think bringsan add dimension, sheer dimension diversity thinking.but also policy.oh, i think everybody brings…maybe risk-taking?on risk-taking, i think, demonstrate empirically lot analytical work thathas do trade floor various circles, risk attitude different. you seethat sort rotation portfolios, instance, study extensively. i thinkwe tend different horizon embrace different priorities. and differentlook risk, yes.that’s good development. let’s talk ecb netherlands, inthe netherlands lot criticism ecb policy, especially low interest rates.it’s good people’s savings, pension system. how see thiscriticism?well, first all, i would like say i hear criticism i completely understand andappreciate concern people have. if you’re saving, risk receive lesspension, obviously concern look that. we monitor weshould appreciate happen – do. i assure do pastand certainly continue done, emphasised, go forward. but say that,our job, give europe euro area particular treaty, tomaintain price stability use tool use order arrive that. i think whathas do ecb use many tool available prove efficient inorder maintain price stability define way back 2003 close butbelow 2%. until time arrive aim have, need continue usingthe tools. interest rate one them.when i look backward, since 2014, lot good development. if i look yourcountry, instance, netherlands, today 9.3 million people work,from 9.3 800,000 job create result monetary policy otherpolicies, fiscal structural reforms. so extremely useful use low interestrate policy go forward; that’s point number 1. point number 2, i realise it’s difficult thepension system, affect pension system euro area member states. so ithink it’s also pension scheme calibrated, organised, structure questionand need look at, affect one country, doesn’t affect others. 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech what i want say even president dutch central bank happywith ecb monetary policy, unhappy address publicstatement couple month ago. do understand concerns?i don’t want revisit past past is. i’m concern ican i help, attentive deliver mission inaccordance mandate. be attentive consequence inflation, otheritems well, include negative effects. number 3, i would observe also ever since istarted november 1, work cooperatively, consensually, include withgovernor knot.you’ve speak this?yes, absolutely, we’ve know long time very, close eachother. i know problem dutch people concern about, i share theirconcern.yes, but…don’t forget one thing: often saver also owner house. house increasedin value course time.yes, also risk.you look everything risk, everything benefit, you’re right; price ofhouses go up. it’s le accessible young people. maybe house would help theprocess. so set policy euro area level, attentive andevery member state well, measure take national level order toaddress negative effects.moody’s conclude today netherlands risk house crisis. be thatsomething worry about?as i said, house price go many large centre euro areamember states, measure take order temper price increases. i think it’snine 19 euro area country already take specific measure temper prices,meaning reduce little bite access credit provide conditionality anexcessive demand relative supply. i also think supply measure could order thathousing encourage develop whenever shortage supplycannot meet demand.which bring another question: even possible adequate monetarypolicy euro area difference country big? if look atinflation example, last six months, netherlands 2.6% theeuropean average 1.4%. so possible?it’s rule game. when euro area set up, euro chosen, wesee people support euro like euro much do, find toolsand put place instrument strengthen euro area. why short bank union?why short capital market union, i small enterprise france, i canactually borrow fund available netherlands consistent anddeeper system finance enterprises. these tool use bring moreharmony, consistency markets. it cannot monetary union. ithas go beyond solid efficient.does weak economy europe worry you? 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech clearly, growth potential hopefully 2022 – forecast – closeto potential, 1.4% growth. we use tools. we do, ithink fiscal policy apply i’m please see netherlandsare deploy fiscal policy sensible wise way order respond situationand use space available without even touch special reserve fund hasbeen set up. but others follow suit inspire dutch example.about dutch budget surplus, imf manage director always say wouldbe good dutch government spend more. do think same, ecbpresident?this happen i understand forecast next two year theywill develop spend education, infrastructure, fight climate change. this exactlywhat country fiscal space do, i think very, welcome.you still say same, minister finance…no, i say i admire considered.yes, minister finance, wopke hoekstra, bite irritate saidthat spend more.i completely understand irritated. we discuss meet eurogroupthe day, give full detail fund expenditure beand spend be. i think sensible that, particularly invest thefuture productivity dutch economy large. i think it’s great.you say day start ecb president.so i yet commit ecb.so understand irritation?i do. i always try understand people get irritate i either explain caseand argue it, i think right. but right i stand contradicted, i fullyunderstand i respect that.you get along well now?yes, do, absolutely!why spend more?because world changing, want remain productive competitive,because nasty development see horizon address forthat, need spend money. we don’t want climate change damage countries. wewant kid educated. we want artificial intelligence something play withon regular basis. we want strong go forward. so that, investment isneeded.investment green deal, it’s economic growth days.no, it’s sustainable growth certainly green deal remarkable respect. the 50measures identify ursula von d leyen good ones, country,each member state sort question public expenditure ask itself: goingto make difference climate change purposes? how i change it, not? i think thenetherlands clearly look issues. your country always attentive 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech nature around anyway.you suggest ecb also responsibility come climate change;in way? your mandate price stability, isn’t it?correct, identify price stability, need ass risk, need forecast growth, youneed understand good economy going. and don’t factor riskassessment forecast model underline that, don’t take accountclimate change. you’re miss big chunk risk loom horizon thatwill upon u much quick think. so respect work, must takeclimate change account. add that, invest, mindful well andhow debate strategy review. plus supervision whenwe look bank value liability assets, need ask whetherthey take climate change risk account well. so multiple ramification weneed ask ourselves: i need change? be climate change really part thinking? i willinsist that.at moment, british people voting. how important outcome europe?i think outcome close loop uncertainty

implement compromise public objective anti-money launder consumer protection –to name two.we must also recognise stablecoin’s business model based, first foremost, ability minimise fluctuation price

financial inclusion digitalization: harness technology inclusive growth” conference “financial integration inclusive development: a view mediterranean countries”/banco de españa e instituto del mediterráneo (iemed) pablo hernández de co governor 2/3 good morning. it privilege chair panel importance financial inclusion digitalisation contribute it. it’s privilege give panel include governor four country broad experience promote financial inclusion, significant initiative area launch central bank take lead. access financial service continue primary problem globally. on late world bank estimates, almost 1.7 billion adult access account offer basic functionality and, therefore, exclude basic service payments, credit saving. this obvious repercussion economic social development, positive correlation growth employment1, thus essential understand cause behind it. in respect, study highlight fact that, although may specific case voluntary factor relate mainly cultural religious aspects, explanation lack access financial service usually find involuntary factors. these include notably lack fund saving, cost, distance near branch, lack education absence financial infrastructure need improve availability financial services. it indeed new technology contribute decisively overcome low barriers. technology reduce many fix costs, traditionally associate development financial services, provide great adaptation supply basis society’s idiosyncratic characteristics. unsurprisingly, then, technological proposal link financial inclusion hail different areas. we find traditional financial institutions, new fintech companies, telecommunication corporation large technology consortium know bigtech. a scope, one activity concentrate bulk initiative payments. thus, past decade see so-called mobile money – i.e. transactional service offer mainly mobile operator – become commonplace. add these, recently digital wallet solution emerge multiple functionality specific proposal international remittances. aside progress payment solutions, development intermediation market provide improvement finance group great degree financial exclusion, microenterprises small agricultural producers. however, development spontaneous uniform one country another. the role regulator policy thus important, least regard two aspects: promotion use development technology, include incorporation technological improvement financial service provision; need ensure headway financial inclusion impair consumer safeguard financial stability. i would like offer brief think two points. promote use development new technologies. logically, develop technological solution require suitable telecommunication infrastructures. they must provide widespread access internet, include rural areas, seek improve digital education offer safeguard vulnerability cyber threats. we forget approximately two-thirds adult population without access 1 see cull et al (2014). 3/3 bank mobile phone. and, world bank point out, device prove essential improve accessibility financial services. moreover, development stable institutional framework – pave way competition, provide legal security new financial proposal ensure appropriate level interoperability – vital generate necessary confidence financial services. also, aspect legal recognition digital identification, use biometrics identification ease access public data “know costumer” (kyc) procedures, matter different tier government push catalyse significantly progress financial inclusion. monitor risk inherent financial innovation. along aforementioned risk link cyber threats, financial innovation, particular aim vulnerable population segments, cause situation over-indebtedness, market abuse fraud. this process must accompany financial education actions, strengthen consumer safeguard measure development data privacy policies. but lose sight speed innovation develop. such speed pose difficulty set regulation place since, many occasions, implementation come use certain practice become widespread market. hence, use formula sandbox innovation hub may help regulator act nimbly create environment innovator good anticipate regulatory trends. lastly, give way panellists, true protagonist debate, i would mention importance international coordination cooperation. many challenge surround financial inclusion use new technology common countries. this role organisation imf, bali declaration, alliance financial inclusion, maya declaration, pivotal boost use new technology field. we also forget role global company bigtech play. indeed, financial inclusion one essential element highlight facebook proposal global mean payment, so-called libra. in view initiatives, worldwide immediate scope, agree international coordination option obligation. yutaka harada member policy board economic activity, prices, monetary policy japan speech meet business leader oita bank japan december 5, 2019 (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction thank give opportunity exchange view take time despite busy schedules. it indeed great honor today. please allow express gratitude great cooperation business operation bank japan, particularly oita branch. the bank implement quantitative qualitative monetary ease -- qqe short -- since april 2013 introduce various additional measure negative interest rate policy, yield curve control, strengthen framework continuous monetary easing, clarification forward guidance policy rates, aim achieve inflation target 2 percent. a result measures, japan's economy improving. it true economic expansion exactly robust, reflect event consumption tax hike fiscal 2014 5 percent 8 percent, late hike october 2019 8 percent 10 percent, slowdown global economy observe mid-2015 early 2016 second half 2018 present, downtrend working-age population. nevertheless, economy manage continue expansion far. today, i would like explain monetary policy measure conduct bank achieved. first foremost, achievement obvious. the unemployment rate decline low level nearly three decade productivity increasing. the challenge lie elsewhere; namely, fact price rising. it increasingly argue interest rate consequently remain low, erode banks' profitability. however, i believe deterioration banks' profitability cause structural problem bank accumulate deposit lend. bank therefore need deal problem. moreover, interest rate raised, would lead decrease demand loans, decline prices, appreciation yen, economic downturn, increase bankruptcy (raising banks' credit costs), forth. therefore, raise interest rate would solve problem. consider current low interest rate partly attributable deflationary monetary policy 2 pursue past, i describe later, way maintain current accommodative monetary policy order achieve sustain expansion economic activity see increase price interest rates. i. monetary ease measure table 1 present outline monetary policy measure conduct bank

a result measures, real interest rate -- nominal interest rate minus expect inflation rate -- greatly decline due decrease nominal interest rate rise inflation expectations. the decline real interest rate stimulate investment, boost stock price japan, lead depreciation yen. rise stock price raise investment lead household become wealthy increase consumption expenditure. it channel economic activity start improve. next, i would like explain stance new forward guidance introduce october 2019, show table 1. the forward guidance april 2019 state bank "intends maintain current extremely low level short- long-term interest rate extend period time, least around spring 2020." while i think clarify forward guidance desirable, i oppose policy proposal basis bank indicate data-dependent guidance clarify link price stability target.1 under new guidance, bank "expects short- long-term interest rate remain present low level long necessary pay close attention possibility momentum toward achieve price stability target lost." although somewhat ambiguous, i vote proposal guidance become akin data-dependent guidance, link price stability target clearer, allow possibility future interest rate reduction. however, i continue oppose allow long-term yield move flexible manner. since i already elaborate reason past, let move next topic.2 ii. achievement bold monetary ease improvement economic activity see various fields. there lot indicator show improvement, employment, productivity, fiscal conditions, investment, exports, corporate profits, wages; moreover, perception economy recovering, 1 for opinion regard data-dependent forward guidance, see yutaka harada, "economic activity, prices, monetary policy japan: speech meet business leader yamanashi," bank japan, march 2019. 2 see reference cite footnote 1. 4 suicide rate, income distribution, women's entry labor market provide indication improvement.3 of indicators, i would like talk today improvement employment, productivity, fiscal conditions. improvement employment the improvement employment clear rise active job openings-to-applicants ratio, decline unemployment rate, increase number employees, indicators. the increase number employee due rise employment rate woman elderly particular. while remain issue many woman elderly regular non-regular employee work short hours, situation certainly improvement past. in age society, fact employment rate elderly actually rise hold great importance. the problem age population number people cannot work old age increase relative number working-age people. it worry seem ratio elderly (those age 65 over) working-age population (those age 15-64) rise 47 percent 2018 70 percent 2045 (and rise moderately 75 percent 2065). however, assume working-age population comprise age 15-69 elderly population consist age 70 over, ratio elderly working-age population reach 49 percent 2045 55 percent 2065. look way, increase employment rate elderly bring monetary ease regard good news japan's age society. next, i would like look employment situation, focus employment environment young. chart 1 show unemployment rate, youth unemployment rate, job offer rate

earlier, unemployment rate japan without doubt would remain range 2.0-3.0 percent throughout. since unemployment rate mid-1990s 2012 average roughly 4.5 percent, current unemployment rate 2.4 percent mean unemployment rate almost halved. this decline unemployment rate also help raise productivity, i touch next. productivity growth productivity also rise tandem improvement employment. since i talk past, i would like note rising.7 let briefly summarize reason behind occurrence. when economy recession, firm curtail investment physical assets, human resources, research development. young people catch employment ice age miss on-the-job train opportunities. although impossible make lose ground, slowly gain time, help gradually raise productivity economy. improvement fiscal condition bold monetary ease stimulate economic activity, increase tax revenues, improve fiscal conditions. chart 2 present ratio relative nominal gdp general government fiscal balance, gross government debt

increase sharply, le unchanged around 121 percent since fiscal 2012.8 7 see harada yutaka, "nihon keizai seisansei: special lecture conference commemorate daiwa institute research's 200th release

debt substantial, problem net government debt large. however, present, net government debt actually also fairly large. net government debt matter consider possibility government debt default. while argue that, give large amount government debt, even small increase interest rate could cause serious problems, important think impact term net debt. the reason interest rate rise, interest receipt financial asset hold government also increase, partly cancel impact gross government debt. chart 2 general government fiscal balance, gross government debt, net government debt (ratios relative

put, price rising. prior introduction qqe, bank decide would aim achieve inflation 2 percent. however, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food october 2019 0.4 percent, long way target.10 you might think problem price rise employment improving, productivity rising, fiscal condition improving. however, price rise, neither interest rates, pose problem financial institutions.11 when ask "why interest rate japan low?" one might answer: "because bank's intention." however, necessarily case. from theoretical perspective, maintain interest rate low level cause economy overheat price rise, possibly result inflation significantly exceed 2 percent. in order avoid this, interest rate need raised. alternatively, rise time due course. in nutshell, long term, low interest rate policy bring increase price nominal interest rates. look different angle, mean japan fell deflation situation low interest rate interest rate 10 accord statistic bureau, ministry

assume interest rate japan determine saving-investment balance japan. another assumption change fiscal condition affect private-sector decision regard save investment. in fiscal 2012, long-term interest rate japan 0.8 percent, gross national savings, equal total investment -- sum domestic foreign investment -- amount 115 trillion yen. the general government deficit decline 26 trillion yen

would pose major problem, would reduce important investment damage japan's economy future; hand, government deficit lead rise interest rates, also reduce important investment, would major problem. argument that low interest rate cause problem in addition debate surround low interest rate mention earlier, argue low interest rate policy allow inefficient firm survive, lead decline productivity and, consequently, decline natural rate interest. this could call "zombie firm argument" -- is, argument low interest rate artificially keep inefficient firm alive.16 yet another argument current low interest rate due low interest rate past bring "frontloading" demand result decline interest rates.17 first all, need note argument focus real, nominal, interest rates. thus, first argument low interest rate policy allow inefficient firm survive, lead decline productivity, implausible give productivity rise result qqe. in addition, inefficient firm force exit market high interest rates, would lead employment issues. in contrast, japan's economy currently face labor shortage due monetary easing. if inefficient firm force exit market, much good occur labor shortage upward wage pressures. with regard second argument current low interest rate merely result "frontloading" future demand, production people's income 16 there claim that, due low interest rates, inefficient firm able survive. for example, see "zonbi kigyō wa hatan jōtai 'oi kashi' de enmei," nikkei, february 9, 2019 kamei katsuji, "zonbi amayakasu nichigin," nikkei, october 4, 2019. these refer follow analysis indicate increase number zombie firm link effect low interest rates: ryan banerjee boris hofmann, "the rise zombie firms: cause consequences," bi quarterly review, bank international settlements, september 2018. 17 see, example, okina kunio, kinri keizai (tokyo: diamond, inc, 2017), 174-177. 14 rising. i assume people high incomes, likely demand high standard live future well. owe stable exchange rate environment bring qqe, foreign visitor come japan. i feel rather strange think japan merely attract visitor expect come future that, since visitor come future, would lead decline economy future. when bank introduce qqe, i assume achieve inflation target 2 percent would take much time. if inflation rate approach 2 percent, bank would raise interest rates. i therefore expect interest rate stay around 0 percent negative territory long period time. it seem many economist similar expectations.18 let go back discussion regard factor underlie low interest rates. give interest rate fall 2 percentage point nominal gdp growth rates, decrease fiscal deficit mention early cannot fully explain low interest rates. in fact, reason interest rate fall much yet fully understood. however, give interest rate unite kingdom unite state -- inflation rate around 2 percent successfully maintain -- remain high interest rate japan, clear japan's past deflationary monetary policy lead decline interest rates. in addition, last five ten year interest rate 2 percentage point nominal gdp growth rates. therefore, might expect situation last forever. 18 for example, hayakawa argue private bank currently hold huge amount government bonds. in term quantity, major bank substantial amount government bonds, duration bond little two years. meanwhile, duration bond hold regional financial institution around four year -- long bond hold major banks. since little demand credit regional financial institutions, institutions' option buy bonds, extend duration bonds. if price government bond fall, regional financial institution would incur great losses, major banks. for details, see hayakawa hideo, "waga kuni kin'yūgyō kadai," shin kokusaku, research institute national policy, november 2012. this argument base assumption monetary ease eventually increase interest rates. also, idea government bond duration four year entail risk reflect assumption that, four years, price rise, thereby lead increase interest rates. 15 iv. low interest rate banks' profitability although clear why, interest rate fall globally negative, japan also many european countries. bank dissatisfy low interest rates. while improve employment situation boost productivity, frequently argue undermine banks' profitability.19 function bank before consider relationship low interest rate banks' profitability, i would like explain banks' functions. how bank make profits? textbook finance define function bank consist information production asset transformation explain banks' profit result perform two functions.20 a information production, banks, behalf depositors, examine borrowers' future profit investment quality assets, ass whether project outcome achieve loan made, check whether borrowers' account information correct. bank demand collateral and/or personal guarantee borrowers. sufficient collateral personal guarantee alleviate banks' burden monitor firms' account information therefore reduce cost information production. since depositor cannot demand collateral personal guarantees, function information production fall banks. if firm provide detail account information, give sufficiently large, could obtain fund capital market would rely bank lending. the reason practice large firm japan borrow bank bank provide inexpensive lend them. this mean lend large firm le profitable banks. while difficult project future profit begin with, certain firm bank project future profit another firm accurately. for instance, large assembler certain extent know sale figure suppliers. the simple reason assembler procure order supplier. similarly, trade 19 see, example, "mienu 'deguchi,' fukusayō zōdai: ginkōkai ni takamaru fuman -- mainasu kinri 3-nen," jiji press, ltd., february 15, 2019, https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2019021500887&g=eco. 20 see, example, iwata kikuo, "kin'yū chūkai kigyō kin'yū," chapter 4 kin'yū (tokyo: toyo keizai inc., 2000). 16 company take part management particular firm may also good place project future profits. bank compete firm information advantages. even firm lend successful, margin bank earn small. since bank allow invest depositors' money, cannot invest venture firm earn return considerable multiple outlays. if bank try ass future profit firm, unknowable, person great authority ultimately make assessment. if firm manage properly, likely would face situation illustrate world novel -- is, credit examination division would stop function human resource division, responsible assess personnel, would engage internal power struggles.21 if bank instead provide loan base observable objective criterion collateral, could cut cost substantially downsize credit examination division and/or human resource division. that is, bank lend base observable objective criterion examine future profit firm exceptional circumstances.22 even focus examination observable objective criteria, bank would something depositor cannot. asset transformation -- banks' function -- consist two components. the first act accumulate short-term deposit transform long-term lending. since borrower use fund buy machinery construct buildings, cannot pay back money short notice. bank lend long term accumulate deposit large number depositors. the second component transformation loan assets, entail possibility default, risk-free deposits. a result, depositor rest assure fund safe entrust banks. this mean 21 although fiction, similar situation vividly describe book focus bank write jun ikeido, as, oretachi baburu nyūkōgumi, (tokyo: bungeishunju ltd., 2004), shairokku kodomotachi, (tokyo: bungeishunju ltd., 2006), rosujene gyakushū, (tokyo: bungeishunju ltd., 2012). the story exaggerate le similar fragmentary information i gain personally. 22 observable objective criterion include deposit withdrawal firms' account well deposit house rent. there also case lenders, banks, manage account deposit house rent. 17 bank transform asset involve risk safe asset function information production. to extent bank maintain amount loan utilize functions? there landowner small amount deposits, deposit would increase succeed business. if quality people's life improves, number people let asset lie idle long term would increase, lead narrow spread short- long-term interest rates. a borrow money even high interest rates, bank might able make loan rates. however, people represent majority. bank make loan even without sufficient collateral. if borrower make certain payment start shop, bank place confidence borrower's diligence steadiness. even amount collateral sufficient banks, borrower certainly consider serious enough, since effort make several year would vain upon failure. in case house loans, 10-20 percent payment might insufficient banks. however, seem payment level would cause problem borrower would want keep house costs. look banks' assets, end-september 2019, total loan make domestically license bank 509 trillion yen, 324 trillion yen corporation (including 206 trillion yen small enterprises) 144 trillion yen households.23 a loan households, end-september 2019, amount house loan 131 trillion yen consumer loan 10 trillion yen.24 i assume total amount loan -- small enterprise household combine -- bank might able gain profit around 350 trillion yen. though base different statistics, end-august 2019, total loan 485 trillion yen, amount loan make interest rate 5 percent stand 5.9 trillion yen.25 23 bank japan, deposits, vault cash, loan bill discounted. 24 bank japan, loan households. 25 bank japan, loan discount outstanding interest rate. 18 increase deposit excess increase loan japanese bank an increase deposit excess increase loan bank also problem. chart 7 show loan-to-deposit ratio (calculated divide loan deposits) bank japan, unite states, unite kingdom, germany, france. in japan, ratio, around 100 percent end 1990s, decline sharply thereafter hover around 60 percent present. on hand, ratio countries, albeit declining, remain around 100 percent except unite states. bank country accumulate deposit extent necessary make loans. even then, bank europe difficulty maintain profitability. for bank japan accumulate excessive amount deposits, situation become even severe. chart 7 loan-to-deposit ratio bank major country from time introduction qqe september 2019, loan domestically license banks, decline trend, increase 79 trillion yen deposit increase much 161 trillion yen.26 in context, news report suggest financial institution struggle

troublesome, consequently could lead reduction number personnel contribute collection deposit need branches. i think would increase productivity bank sector, thus japan's economy whole. there concern that, face difficulty expand lend accumulate much deposits, bank japan seem try reduce deposits, instead rely risky lend investment recommend customer buy investment trust rather make deposits. estimate financial service agency (fsa) customers' total return investment trust (after fee commissions) suggest that, end-march 2019, 34 percent customer investment trust distributor face negative total returns.28 give average hold period fund think around three year stock price major country rise period, include japan, nikkei 225 stock average rise around 25 percent, return fund positive. this mean negative return must due high fee commissions. a highlight fsa, distributor investment trust seem encourage customer churn fund short term gain profit transaction fees.29 moreover, look cost return investment trust fund type distributor, i find bank security firm engage face-to-face sale tend sell trust involve high cost low returns. in contrast, independent investment trust firm security firm specialize sale via internet tend sell trust low cost offer high returns.30 27 see, example, 2-day series, minami takero nakatani shogo, "chigin haran jinzai kokatsu kiki," nikkei, february 20 21, 2019. 28 for details, see financial service agency, "publication monitor result pertain implementation status customer-oriented business conduct take financial institutions" (the full text

jun ikeido, mention earlier. 29 toshihide endo, "to turn challenge opportunities," speech 34th annual general meet reception international banker association japan, financial service agency, november 2018. 30 see footnote 28 reference. 20 some financial institution europe, interest rate also low, process significantly enhance business efficiency due prolong sluggishness profits. since drastic employment adjustment europe seem difficult due factor labor practices, financial institution revise organizational structure globally, include japan. give japan face labor shortage due bold monetary easing, revision easy europe. if bank successfully downsize number asset holdings, would become profitable. in capitalism market economy, firm need switch unprofitable profitable business areas. if bank release human resource capital make shift, positive impact japan's economy whole. although i recognize difficulty give business japan, bank -- form core capitalism market economy -- understand point, i believe productivity economy improve greatly.31 conclude remark nearly seven year pass since introduction bold monetary ease 2013, almost five year pass since i appoint member policy board bank. even now, achieve inflation target 2 percent seem long way off. interest rate rise due low inflation. however, owe bold monetary easing, economic activity clearly improved. employment, especially youth employment, improved. have bank implement bold monetary ease since 1990s, employment ice age could avoided. there also various positive developments, i mention earlier. however, since interest rate rising, banks, believe profit would increase high interest rates, express grow dissatisfaction. in opinion, banks' low profitability cause structural problem accumulate deposit lend bank sector whole therefore able maintain current size. a show chart 5, past ten year 31 the solution shrink size bank consider novel jun ikeido mention earlier. i fully understand difficult implement practice difficult even world fiction. 21 interest rate fail rise meaningful extent, thus might premature conclude possible see return former situation. if bank raise interest rate now, would revive deflationary mindset consequently delay increase price interest rates. this would benefit bank sector either. some argue bank raise interest rate soon japan's economy good state give demographic trends. however, introduction qqe real gdp per working-age person start increase; therefore, raise interest rate would throw u back. that is, raise interest rate would lead following: appreciation yen; fall stock prices; decline exports, investment, consumption employment; reemergence employment ice age. thank attention. u.s. regulation approach cryptocurrencies december 03, 2019 post december 12, 2019 michael held, executive vice president general counsel remark bi central bank legal experts’ meeting, basel, switzerland a prepare delivery thank you, diego, “volunteering” speak digital currencies—a field i count much trainee, expert. today i focus u.s. regulatory landscape digital currencies, particular digital currency issue private organization intend use like money. a always, view i express own, necessarily federal reserve bank new york federal reserve system.1 policy maker regulator unite states, date, develop overarch framework regulate private digital currencies. the field see new comprehensive regulatory response. to sure, digital nature new private currency raise challenge policy maker must respond. in view, however, spend much time wrestle novelty digital currency forget private currency nothing new. the theme talk today accordingly best encapsulate quote attributed—perhaps wrongly—to mark twain: “history may repeat itself, rhyme.” the past be not dead. it isn’t even past so, let’s take little walk history privately-issued currency. we begin michigan 1837, state legislature pass first “free” bank law unite states.2 upon commence business, free bank could issue banknotes—that is, private currencies—that redeemable specie—gold silver.3 these banknote transferable debt back general creditworthiness bank issue them, plus asset like bond mortgage real estate, brief time, personal guarantees.4 the statute permit bank organizer establish bank file application local county treasurer county clerk. they need approval state bank commissioner. (at time, unite state federal bank supervisor.5 indeed, “free banking” era generally begin congress’s failure recommission second bank unite state charter expire 1836, end passage national bank act 1863.) the result, predictably, chaotic. the state bank commissioner unsure many bank even established.6 some bank michigan establish intent issue banknote without intent ever redeem them.7 by 1839 almost entire system collapsed. after close one bank michigan, commissioner find shard window glass, lead, nail find gold silver coin.8 some free bank become know “wildcat” banks. they set office remote areas—where wildcat roamed—making difficult redeem note specie.9 in truth, fate free bank bad. free bank new york apparently fare pretty well.10 but experience michigan state demonstrate risk deal lightly regulate issuer private currency time. banknote era consistently transfer discount,11 state-to-state requirement value asset back varied,12 bank engage speculative activities: build hotels, roads, railroads, canals.13 i’m tell also engage banking. by 1860s congress feed free bank system. in address unite state senate 1863, senator john sherman ohio decried: “we every diversity bank system country devise wit man, bank power issue paper money. with multiplicity bank . . . impossible uniform national currency, value constantly affect issues. there common regulator; dependent different systems. . . . there check control banks. there want harmony concert among them.”14 the national bank act authorize creation national bank would issue national bank notes. it push towards harmony private currency, press need wartime government throe civil war. unlike wildcat banknotes, national bank note back universally federal government bond deposit money, u.s. government issue “greenback,” case hold unite state treasury, circulate parity form money.15 the national bank act also introduce division bank commerce unite states, may erase more-speculative bank activity wildcat era.16 federal intervention tight regulation mean national bank note safe fungible wildcat predecessors, unite states’ transition national bank notes, couple new, unfavorable tax treatment state bank notes, mean demise wildcat banknotes.17 decade later, establishment federal reserve system, central bank currency, push bank engage deposit-taking activity mean overall demise private currency unite state decades.18 the child be father man this is, admittedly, fairly crude history money bank unite states, see i’m go this. it hard see certain parallel today’s digital currency bank note issue wildcat era. digital currency develop absence comprehensive regulatory system, countless digital currencies, countless idiosyncrasies, countless entity vary quality issue them. accord one source, currently nearly 3000 digital currency i doubt anyone really know true number.19 while see issuer digital currency hold shard glass, lead, nail reserve, see digital currency back design—bitcoin prime example—digital currency back volatile digital currencies—for put premium safety—and digital currency style donald trump, vladimir putin, kanye west—though mr. west’s lawyer make sure coinye never really get ground. the analogy current era wildcat era isn’t perfect, course. history rhyme all; doesn’t repeat. in contrast wildcat era, various federal regulator demonstrate willingness apply exist regulatory tool digital currencies. but, policy maker regulator also still monitor development digital currencies, fully formulate cohesive policy response. whether like not, however, begin confront least two question similar policymakers address wan day wildcat era: 1. should national government restrict unsafe particularly volatile private currencies? 2. should national government limit private currency issuance tightly regulate institution government incentivize mandate certain desirable features? a i’ve already suggested, current u.s. law direct answer questions. digital currency fall variety categories: commodity security instruments. how digital currency classify depend partly functional use digital currency partly priority various lawmaker regulatory agency authority regulate it. the financial crime enforcement network (fincen), primary u.s. authority responsible implement u.s. anti-money launder laws, one first authority issue guidance unite state digital currencies. fincen clarify 2013 transmitter exchanger digital currency money service business fincen regulations, digital currency act substitute real currency equivalent value real currency.20 accordingly, person engage business transfer exchange digital currency subject fincen requirement establish anti-money launder program, include recordkeeping, reporting, customer identification verification requirements.21 fincen’s early entrance field seek address fact digital currencies, like form payment, may use nefarious purposes. fast forward 2017. jay clayton, chairman security exchange commission (sec), federal agency regulate securities, release statement digital currency initial coin offer (icos). in chairman clayton’s view, “tokens offer incorporate feature market effort emphasize potential profit base entrepreneurial managerial effort others continue contain hallmark security u.s. law.”22 in 2018, sec staff publish guidance clarify exchanges, investment vehicles, investment advisers, dealer business digital currency digital asset security would subject security laws.23 the guidance make clear digital currency function security subject u.s. security law, draw line may always clear. product blur boundary money security new. take, instance, certificate deposit. in 1982, unite state supreme court analyze whether certificate deposit security purpose certain u.s. anti-fraud laws. the court conclude not. in so, court recognize important distinction certificate deposit issue bank—money—and long-term debt comprehensive regulation bank system.24 the court’s conclusion sensible one century “wildcat” bank era: lawmaker could intend treat money bank system like something else need so. at least now, case appear strong digital currencies. without regulatory framework design digital currencies, regulator unite state react abuse instead proactively address risks. a example, commodity future trade commission (cftc), agency unite state regulate future derivative contracts, use enforcement authority fraudulent purchase sale commodity stop allege digital currency scheme.25 organizer scheme claim digital currency question—my big coin—was back gold actively traded, cftc conclude neither true, payouts customer fund money fraudulently obtain victim scheme, organizer misappropriate approximately $6 million customer assets.26 my big coin appear modern wildcat currency, scheme detect cftc could regulate commodity. we fortunate that, today, cftc market-based authority combat fraud u.s. commodity market present wildcat era. meanwhile, banks, focus federal regulatory effort hold transfer money, largely engage holding, transferring, <gasp> issue digital currencies, federal bank regulator unite state remain largely silent permissibility activities.27 the office comptroller currency (occ) seek carve special-purpose charter—its so-called “fintech charter”—presumably bring activity occ’s regulatory umbrella, since mire litigation issue special-purpose charter state u.s. wish license activity local law.28 separately, bureau consumer financial protection, authority write rule govern certain consumer account payment products, determine would analyze digital currency try bring purview recent amendment regulation e.29 to sure, state within u.s. begin adopt law regulation digital currency businesses. new york wyoming, cite two examples, adopt digital currency-specific regimes. there is, however, little coordination approach state level,30 highlight state-by-state approach risk inconsistent treatment possibility “race bottom” license standard could reminiscent wildcat era. the challenge state face craft sensible rule amplify respect digital currencies, tend operate without borders. if worrier like me, would worry put alternative approach new problem exhaust old solutions? would worry effectively respond digital currency achieve critical mass? governor quarles highlight latter concern recent remark european bank federation.31 he note stable coin pose risk financial stability today bring potential scale could pose regulatory challenge financial stability standpoint future. but know regulator u.s. already deal concern fraud prospect form misconduct relate digital currencies, acknowledge governor quarles’ concern financial stability, would behoove u start identify area focus craft regulatory response proactive? pablo hernández de cos, chairman basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) governor bank spain, remark november digital currency “do reliably perform standard function money unsafe rely medium exchange store value.”32 that sound like problem. we deal somewhat similar problem before. under national bank act, unite state choose reform currency system adopt new regulatory regime national banks—the would-be issuer stable private currency (that is, national bank notes)—and craft requirement issuer backstop currency safe government-issued bonds. these step serve stabilize private currency issuer currencies, benefit approach easy overlook: disincentivized le desirable products—wildcat note (that is, impose tax them); certain key participant system—specifically custodian bank trust companies—were already regulate institutions; bank note certain level transparency build in—a holder’s right receive payment literally write face note; intent purposes, federal law regulation ubiquitous. we also develop comprehensive regulatory scheme target widely-used financial product evolved, include recent work regulate swap transactions. if digital currency reach critical mass, may want draw lesson effort consider whether tool regulate systemically important activity fit purpose. the designation process dodd-frank act systemically important financial institution may instructive here, regardless whether directly applicable digital currencies. in process, financial stability oversight council (fsoc) authority designate enhance regulation supervision certain financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, payments, clearing, settlement (pcs) activities, extent fsoc determine organization activity systemically important. though authority dodd-frank act limit ways—it apply certain systemically important activity designation process require coordination across regulatory agency relate administrative processes—the scheme flexible way contemplate activities-based approach regulation oversight addition prudential approach certain institutions.33 to crystal clear, i say digital currency currently ripe consideration fsoc designation process; similarly flexible though necessarily identical process involve coordination collaboration across multiple regulator may warranted. the path forward in apply lesson learn past modern era, one path forward might consider follow question determine whether broad regulatory scheme sensible: 1. first, authorize act issuer digital currency intermediary hold transfer digital currency behalf holder? and, exist regulation adequate cover each? if not, consider expand regulatory perimeter address prudential regulatory standpoint? do would provide u avenue address risk may pose holder system broadly. 2. second, certain feature digital currency either desirable undesirable regulatory policy standpoint? if so, restriction incentive adopt avoid recurrence landscape resemble wildcat era? at minimum shouldn’t aim clarity certain essential features, clarity right digital currency holder nature asset back digital currency? 3. third, key activity cardinal function digital currency require special attention regulators? these may include action create, distribute, destroy, transfer digital currencies, may also include key infrastructures, technology underpin particular digital currency. to extent critical activity perform actor within regulatory purview, fill potential gap oversight? 4. fourth, agree common approach across jurisdiction least aspect refine regulatory approach? digital currency design use across borders. key party may situate across globe. if reach ubiquity regulation, least something approach it, isn’t coordination way so? the financial stability board basel committee bank supervision may address questions, it’s soon know conclude. 5. last, consider lens view activities? common sense dictate begin approach consider protection holder digital currency unfair loss potential certain digital currency present risk financial stability. be factor u consider? this easy stuff. some might look list, want faster, ready-made solution. i hear now: “why put activity bank system borrow robust regulatory structure?” i think consider that, bank regulation may fit purpose. history rhymes; doesn’t repeat—that’s last time i use line. so, time consider bank go forward, also consider fundamental questions: (i) what practical approach? (ii) what approach give u right balance functional risk-based regulation? (iii) what approach neutral technological change? (iv) what approach provide clarity great extent possible (recognizing every model faults)? (v) what approach last next cycle innovation? i mention sec earlier. the sec analyze digital currency use test supreme court formulate almost 90 year ago—that mind boggling, sec does, also still relevant—this something worth strive for. you might surprise i don’t answer next 90 year digital currency regulation look like, i hope opportunity explore issue you. thank you. 1 many thank joseph

wakatabe deputy governor bank japan financial settlement system social infrastructure: disaster management perspective open remark symposium "the impact natural disaster financial market financial institutions" hold nagoya city university graduate school bank japan november 28, 2019 (english translation base japanese original) 1 i. introduction i delight give opportunity speak symposium. japan risk various natural disaster -- wind flood damage cause typhoon heavy rain, volcanic eruption well earthquakes, great hanshin-awaji earthquake great east japan earthquake. this year again, typhoon faxai hagibis inflict serious damage. the probability massive earthquake may occur nankai trough pacific coast within next 30 year estimate 70-80 percent. disaster prevention measure also update preparation case earthquake occur consecutively certain time lag initial event nankai trough, something experience past. many country seem vigilant risk terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, widespread power outage trigger transmission equipment malfunction. grow attention, however, pay natural disaster worldwide. accord statistical data natural disaster compile université catholique de louvain's center research epidemiology disasters, number case recently range 300-350 year, large past1 (chart 1). although different country put priority different risks, climate change risk increasingly recognize global issue, especially among european country recent years.2 this could also relate unusual weather, include concentrate heavy rain frequently experience japan lately.3 1 the increase since 1970s seem partly reflect improvement accuracy statistics. tomohiko inui, "shizen saigai keizai seichō," keizai seminā, no. 706, february/march 2019 issue: 25. 2 grow attention give impact climate change real economy financial system among financial supervisory authority central banks. this topic increasingly discuss international conferences, include network green financial system (ngfs). the bank japan announce today (november 28) join ngfs. for example central banks' initiative issue, see margherita giuzio et al., "climate change financial stability," financial stability review, may 2019, https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/fsr/special/html/ecb.fsrart201905_1~47cf778cc1.en.html#toc1; lael brainard, "why climate change matter monetary policy financial stability," speech "the economics climate change," research conference sponsor federal reserve bank san francisco, november 8, 2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20191108a.htm. 3 accord report compile japan's ministry environment others, solid 2 how respond climate change discuss various perspective thus far, treat practical, global issue go forward. look back natural disaster postwar japan, many severe disaster call mind. in particular, typhoon vera, also know isewan typhoon, strike september 1959, become turn point japan develop disaster countermeasures.4 the extensive damage cause isewan typhoon lead basic act disaster management, stipulate basic underlie japan's disaster management control measures, enforce 1962 (chart 2). in response this, bank japan formulate disaster management operation plan 1967. the theme symposium "the impact natural disaster financial market financial institutions." today, i would firstly like describe bank's role function context japan's disaster management, then, refer past actions, talk importance maintain "financial settlement system social infrastructure" time disaster. in normal times, tend assume social infrastructure, transportation, water, sewage, electricity, gas, telecommunication, naturally available like air. once large-scale disaster strikes, however, become aware whether social infrastructure continue work critical lives. financial settlement system also part social infrastructure. face large-scale disaster, financial institution play various role social infrastructure time -- recovery phase reconstruction phase, example (chart 3). in next part, i first elaborate expect role financial institution shortly disaster strikes. moreover, disaster management consider cycle actions. the cycle comprise two parts: (1) post-disaster action minimize spread prolongation evidence frequency strength cyclone increase long run, except north atlantic. ministry environment et al., kikō hendō kansoku yosoku oyobi eikyō hyōka tōgō repōto 2018: nihon kikō hendō sono eikyō [synthesis report observations, projection impact assessment climate change, 2018: climate change japan impacts] (february 2018): 54, http://www.env.go.jp/earth/tekiou/report2018_full.pdf. 4 dead miss nationwide total 5,000 people. particularly serious damage experience aichi, mie, gifu prefecture due storm surge. 3 damage (2) pre-disaster action prevent damage forecast future disaster base lesson past. it important view two part interrelate sequence, cycle (chart 4).5 toward end talk, i would like describe disaster management perspective. ii. the bank japan designate public institution the bank list designate public institution basic act disaster management, together japanese red cross society electric power companies, example. along national local governments, designate public institution require make necessary arrangement protect "the lives, bodies, property citizen disaster." the bank issue banknote conduct monetary policy, also provide system settle fund smoothly among financial institutions. for example, let's consider situation, show chart 5, pay good service bank transfer account bank a merchant's account bank b. transaction information, amount transfer fund payee's account number, notify bank b zengin system, nationwide online network system banks. the net settlement position calculate financial institution notify bank japan financial network system (boj-net). fund settle financial institutions' current account bank. in situation firm make bank transfer salary payment account bank b account bank a, fund settle opposite direction. the zengin system affiliate japanese banker association, bank monitor major private payment settlement system time ensure stable operation. the boj-net system develop operate bank, settle fund among financial institution prepare various risks. the bank prepare necessary business continuity, aim fulfil mission ensure stable operation payment settlement system addition issue banknote even time disaster. 5 cabinet office, "heisei 17-nen-ban bōsai hakusho" [white paper disaster management 2005], 2005, http://www.bousai.go.jp/kaigirep/hakusho/h17/bousai2005/html/honmon/hm140106.htm. 4 iii. experience great east japan earthquake what would severe earthquake strike alert warn massive tsunami issue minute later? those near coast would evacuate high grind immediately bare minimum belongings. what would return home tsunami recede find cash muddy burn stick together home? what passbook register seal wash away tsunami? what payday next week bank branch account sweep away tsunami? when great east japan earthquake strike 2011, problem actually occur extensively affect areas, cause anxiety many people. at time, financial institution affect area damaged, continue make strenuous effort fulfill mission. to help u consider today's topic, let briefly look back financial institutions' action time.6 1. the bank japan's experience at 2:46 p.m. march 11, 2011, bank's sendai branch experience strong quake. object fell ceiling branch shroud haze create dust. when quake finally subsided, voice resound branch, "the boj-net function properly." trigger call, staff resume work continue business operations. financial institution make massive fund transfer via boj-net every day.7 if compare money blood japan's economy, shutdown boj-net mean absence blood flow economy. the bank make follow response time. firstly, 15 minute earthquake occurred, set disaster management team head governor. the team gather information concern damage, coordinate government relevant parties, disseminate information domestically internationally operational status bank's office financial markets. 6 bank japan payment settlement system department, "higashi nihon daishinsai chokugo kin'yū kessai-men dōkō: dēta ni motozuku jijitsu seiri," boj report & research papers, march 2013, http://www.boj.or.jp/research/brp/ron_2013/data/ron130311a.pdf. 7 the value fund transfer settle via boj-net 150 trillion yen average every business day fiscal 2018. 5 a march 11 friday, bank's branch office affect tohoku region continue supply cash financial institution open service counter weekend. this meet increase cash demand because, disaster occurs, people seek hold cash hand need secure fund immediate live expense fear future. in time disaster, demand cash tend increase sharply perform two-fold function money: medium exchange (i.e., mean payment) store value.8 a day disaster, massive amount damage banknote coin bring bank exchange clean ones. the bank meet request send staff part japan help branch affect areas. in iwate prefecture, bank branch, set temporary counter local financial institution provide exchange service. the bank delegate service private financial institution make payment public pension government workers' salaries, well provide service relate receipt payment treasury funds, include receipt taxes. since many delegate agents, financial institutions' locations, also damage time,9 bank take part work delegate them. a timely response required, partly payday self-defense officer involve relief rescue operation region schedule week disaster. with regard payment settlement systems, boj-net continue operate stable manner without halt even time disaster. the bank also continue monitor operational status payment settlement system run private organizations, work cooperation necessary effect smooth settlement transactions, include salary payments, increase toward end month. 8 strictly speaking, money also function measure value. 9 of 40 agent tohoku region, 16 become temporarily unable continue business operations. 6 2. impact financial institution response let turn impact financial institution affect area immediately disaster. a march 14, 280 location close follow evacuation order response tsunami nuclear accident. this 10 percent location 72 financial institution headquarter one six prefecture tohoku region ibaraki prefecture. this fact alone enough tell financial institution find difficult situation along affect population. how financial institution fulfill role social infrastructure situation? let u look back action details. first, financial institution affect area seek secure abundant cash hand usual immediately disaster meet increase cash demand affect customers. these institution withdraw cash current account bank deliver headquarter branch affect areas. since traffic network disruption restriction well lack cash-delivery vehicles, financial institution neighbor area sometimes share them. on back actions, cash total 310 billion yen withdraw bank financial institution tohoku region first week disaster. this three time amount period previous year. financial institution conduct business flexible manner enable affect customer withdraw deposit long identification confirmed, even lose passbook register seals. this response incorporate request make financial service agency bank financial institution treat affect people favorably.10 disaster victim lose passbook relevant document able withdraw close 6.0 billion yen financial institution april 2011, even three affect prefecture alone (chart 6). moreover, affect bring waterlogged burn cash financial institutions, able exchange new cash. damage cash bring financial institution disaster victim also exchange 10 in general, financial service agency bank make decision whether put request forward financial institution time disaster relief act apply affect areas. 7 bank's service counters, amount reach 470,000 banknote (3.5 billion yen) 4,220,000 coin (0.14 billion yen) march 2012 (charts 7 8). even financial institution find difficult restore affect branches, remain available affect depositor much possible by, example, set temporary locations. among bank location close immediately disaster, 40 percent resume business end march. during time, 41 temporary location also set (charts 9 10).11 meanwhile, boj-net core payment settlement system private sector maintain stable operation whole. even end march, concentration large number payment salaries, public utility services, others, serious disruption payment settlement affect areas. behind scenes, zengin system, process transfer data, boj-net extend operate hour consecutive day complete many schedule transaction possible within day.12 in addition, various measure take maintain clear function financial institutions. they include clear house cover work clear house close due damage build reasons. at time great east japan earthquake, foreign medium often report japan's public order maintain even extreme situation.13 i believe ensure payment settlement function financial institution well circulation cash whole contribute social stability affect areas. 11 in addition, financial institution organize information-sharing arrangement among affect person evacuate distant location would able withdraw cash financial institution accounts. 12 a system failure financial institution march 14 significantly delay submission transfer instruction zengin system. the zengin system boj-net deal situation extend operate hours. 13 nicholas kristof, "sympathy japan, admiration," new york times, march 11, 2011, https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/sympathy-for-japan-and-admiration/. kyung lah, "amid disaster, japan's societal more remain strong," cnn, april 10, 2011, http://edition.cnn.com/2011/world/asiapcf/03/16/japan.cultural.order/index.html. 8 3. development financial market policy response the great east japan earthquake also significant impact financial markets. when uncertainty future heighten due disaster reasons, financial institution firm seek proactively secure cash hand, liquidity. this similar household increase cash demand earthquake i mention earlier. in response developments, bank judge take possible measure relieve concern fund immediately ensure financial market stability. it provide fund total record high 21.8 trillion yen funds-supplying operation march 14, first business day earthquake. the bank continue offer same-day funds-supplying operation six consecutive business day march 22 (chart 11). with bank's provision ample funds, notable turbulence money markets, financial institution lend borrow fund other. the bank also decide april 28, month disaster, introduce funds-supplying operation support financial institution disaster areas. although quite time fund need recovery reconstruction gain momentum, bank aim make fund financial institution easy initial subsequent phase disaster. meanwhile, look development stock foreign exchange markets, nikkei stock average, instance, decline sharply damage become apparent, eventually fall 1,015 yen, 10.6 percent march 15 previous business day (chart 12). this rate decline still third large history, follow record black monday 1987 lehman brother failure 2008. in foreign exchange market, amid yen's appreciation, concert foreign exchange market intervention conduct authority japan, unite states, unite kingdom, canada, european central bank march 18. iv. initiative great east japan earthquake over eight year pass since great east japan earthquake. base lesson 9 disaster, initiative enhance disaster management take various level japan's government individual firms, still way. financial institution also enhance disaster management programs, summarize follow three point (chart 13). the first self-help initiatives. many financial institution face risk power shortage traffic network disruption time earthquake. such experience highlight importance backup arrangement computer system headquarters' function place remote headquarter -- example, osaka headquarter tokyo -- order maintain payment settlement function even time disaster. in fact, financial institution strive set site enhance functions. recently, increase number financial institution introduce dual operation, main office also backup office conduct part business operation even normal times.14 the second mutual assistance initiatives. financial institution recognize that, give expect magnitude damage possible nankai trough earthquake disasters, individual institution alone cannot make adequate preparations, even tries, costly compare management resources. some financial institution create regional councils, make arrangement participate financial institution provide need cash time disaster. on level financial markets, include money markets, security markets, foreign exchange market, initiative push forward enhance framework market-level business continuity plan (bcp). this enable financial institution participate market immediately share damage situation and, base assessment, discus possible change trade practice market function smoothly.15 14 accord survey conduct bank may 2019, close 80 percent financial institution backup office osaka respond introduce dual operation business normal times. 15 the market-level bcp framework participant money markets, security markets, foreign exchange market share information cooperate disaster disrupt normal market management, view maintain quickly recover function markets. 10 the third public assistance initiatives. since great east japan earthquake, japan's national local government revise upward estimation damage cause possible large-scale earthquakes, flood due heavy rains, disasters, also update hazard maps. this impose challenge financial institutions, especially locate near coast, add momentum progress detail consideration preparation viewpoint business continuity employee safety. specific measure base local circumstance also advanced; example, improvement priority road suppose restore sooner well registration emergency vehicle -- useful cash delivery time disaster. meanwhile, bank introduce framework enable financial institution receive cash another nearby branch bank branch bank office financial institution current account branch bank affected.16 v. continuous review enhancement business continuity arrangement of financial institution japan, many already prepare business continuity arrangements? accord bank's survey 2014, 85 percent financial institutions, include bank security companies, answer companywide business continuity management framework already put place regularly reviewed.17 financial institution run business assess various risk credit risk borrower market risk associate bond holdings. operational risk, include computer system failures, also need considered, therefore, upgrade business continuity arrangement important managerial issue disaster preparation. give this, financial institution take grant arrangement place, also need advance further. from perspective, view serve social infrastructure even time disaster, three thing expect financial institution go forward (chart 14). each contribute enhancement resilience disaster -- is, capability minimize damage, achieve prompt recovery, continue business operations. 16 http://www5.boj.or.jp/hakken/hatsu1809.pdf. 17 bank japan financial system bank examination department, "questionnaire survey business continuity management (september 2014)," paper series risk management financial institutions, may 2015, https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/brp/ron_2015/data/ron150515a.pdf. 11 the first enhance disaster preparedness. refer "6 ps" -- proper plan preparation prevent poor performance -- essential repeatedly review improve business continuity arrangement take opportunity cop actual disaster conduct periodic emergency drills. the bank practice emergency drill every september, involve disaster management team head governor. we continue update way conducted, instance, implement drill scenarios, include detail extent damage, without advance disclosure participants, present information spot. to improve exist business continuity arrangements, reflect lesson learn drill. it essential financial institution get business continuity framework entrench organization keep work toward increase feasibility time disaster by, example, update content emergency drill review experience management leadership. the second enhance inter-organizational cooperation. when disaster strikes, control damage key. in connection, cooperation among relate organization matter minimize impact damage achieve swift recovery. one option build relationship normal time local governments, financial institutions, utility firm well monetary authorities, include bank's branches, able cooperate time disaster necessary. it also important confirm significant gap counterpart business continuity arrangement assume emergency situations. the third enhance flexibility imagination. change circumstance emergence new risk take place constantly. a i mention earlier, climate change risk increasingly recognize worldwide. moreover, although natural disaster, also observe increase cyber security threat global scale recent years. in financial sector, cyber drill conduct international level, g-7 framework, domestic level, among financial institutions. national government also take lead develop cyber countermeasures.18 such cyber security 18 for work raise alarm cyber risk, see david e. sanger, the perfect weapon: war, sabotage, fear cyber age (london: scribe, 2018). principle regulatory response 12 measure become even important increase use mobile payments. japan's national local government may revise disaster damage estimation future, public expectation service provide social infrastructure may also change. it vital pay due attention change circumstance emergence new risks, review flexibility fertile imagination see whether room improvement business continuity arrangements. vi. conclude remark thus far, discussion focus role financial institution time disaster, look back response great east japan earthquake. in time disaster, critical financial institution ensure cash circulation maintain payment settlement function social infrastructure underpin financial economic activities. even prepare disasters, often require take different measure time actual disaster. after disaster wind down, essential reflect experience, serve start point toward advance preparation possible future disasters. in sense, risk crisis management never ends.19 i hear central japan economic federation publish report current situation challenge social infrastructure preparation nankai trough earthquake, one anticipate natural disaster risk particularly fear region.20 i expect financial institution advance review disaster management action cyber risk propose mainly perspective macroprudential policy anil k. kashyap anne wetherilt, "some principle regulate cyber risk," aea paper proceed 109 (2019): 482-87. for

conference: macroeconomic imbalance eu convergence 07 november 2019 welcome speech open conference dear friend central bank bosnia herzegovina, distinguish panelists, dear guests, dear colleagues, good morning you. it great pleasure welcome sarajevo, another international research conference central bank, jointly organize usaid finra project. a number expert agree large macro imbalance main cause euro area crisis. the eu react many institutional organizational changes. this process continue conference hope part effort discus macroeconomic imbalance eu convergence process. i would mention main macroeconomic imbalances: excessive government deficit debts, excessive bank credit expansion, stock market real estate bubbles, large external 2 account surplus deficits. all result serious economic problem unattended. in bosnia herzegovina, know, currency board regime. we independent monetary policy, use nominal exchange rate policy tool. if action needed, must rely fiscal policy use flexible labor market bring necessary adjustment. fiscal policy option also limited, especially trend age population decrease work age population. in case structural imbalances, even fiscal policy measure reduce efficiency. policy maker must keep mind macroeconomic context. let u take, example, annual growth rate credit bh 2006, 2007 first half 2008. just global financial crisis (gfc), loan private sector grow rate high 30 per cent annually. although view sign overheating, policy maker also consider factor low initial level lending. today, accelerate credit growth would consider serious vulnerability. similarly, path accession towards eu bring structural change candidate country’s economy. the convergence process generate imbalance that, address properly, may dangerous macroeconomic stability. if imbalance neglected, country may, best, stay accession process long time. during accession period, legal framework 3 institutional landscape eu continue evolve, so, may trigger additional challenge process economic convergence. bh far formally report european commission via define framework countries’ identification report macroeconomic imbalance within so-called european semester. for conference, select several topic relevant central eastern european eu member states, balkans. these indicate kind challenge might lie ahead bh candidate potential candidate countries. in addition, bh may good understand fast real economic convergence might happen. today, also share find key macroeconomic imbalance bh. we also choose two topic special interest central banks: harmonization business financial cycles, determinant real exchange rates. none fully dependent action central banks, impact them. finally, i would like express gratitude author panelist accept invitation come share key message us. lady gentlemen, wish conference contribute improvement macroeconomic policymaking bosnia herzegovina productive professional dialogue institution european union.

interest day. thank much attention. stephen s poloz: big issue ahead - bank canada’s 2020visionremarks mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, empire club ofcanada, toronto, ontario, 12 december 2019.* * *introductionit become tradition give speech end year major issuesaffecting canadian economy. i get say once, i hope permit me…today, i want focus bank’s 2020 vision.i want walk major force act economy indicate thebank them. i touch issue back september thechanging fortune round table spruce meadows, calgary. since then, i’ve workingto formalize idea paper, bank publish today.in step back many short-term issue plate, i avoid cover thesame grind last week’s speech deputy governor tim lane. tim discuss theconsiderations behind late interest rate announcement offer excellent historicalanalysis put context.big issue aheadthe basic story global economy since 2008 global financial crisis one ofdisappointing economic growth—serial disappointment, come call it. yes, prove verydifficult recover great recession follow crisis. but long-term,structural factor also work.two basic factor drive trend economic growth: population growth productivity growth.global population growth peak mid-1960s slow ever since. this put anatural brake global economic growth. and recent productivity gain largeenough offset impact demographic slowdown.there course potential high productivity growth future. i refer hasbeen call fourth industrial revolution—the increase use artificial intelligence (ai),machine learn big data throughout economy. however, judge past experience,these productivity gain could slow arrive. computer go widespread use the1980s, surge productivity growth emerge period 1995 2005. idelivered paper week ago conference host federal reservebank san francisco.besides, near-term risk around productivity growth tilt downside. this isbecause trade conflicts, emergence nationalist populist policy generally,threaten reverse prior productivity gain make globalization. tariff onimports force company dismantle supply chain create new one likely tobe le efficient. at time, uncertainty future trade policy criticalinstitutions like world trade organization insidious effect—companies havecut investment plans, also mean le potential economic growth future.on balance, then, look like global economy set continue slow economic growth formostly structural reasons. for reasons, mean low interest rate likelyto persist too. 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech to clear, i make near-term prediction bank canada’s policy rate. i amtalking structural force act global economy global interest rate aperiod years. in era, interest rate fluctuate around trend line, determine bystructural forces, monetary policy. what i say era, look like interestrates likely fluctuate around historically low levels.now, one possible consequence persistently low interest rate household indebtednessmay continue increase relative overall economy. government indebtedness might alsocontinue rise government try kick-start sluggish economies.the world stock debt type three time global gross domestic product(gdp). experience show high debt level amplify impact shock theeconomy, rise unemployment. this borrower could default ontheir debts, lead financial institution lend less, even fail. meanwhile, government ahigh debt load may le able stimulate falter economy.in canada, household indebtedness important financial vulnerability. the late datashow household debt 177 percent disposable income, bite last year’s record high,but still elevated.for country stock government debt cause concern. usgovernment debt 100 percent gdp rise quickly. in japan, than200 percent. in comparison, canada’s total government debt close 90 percent gdp, ofwhich federal debt 30 percent.policy-makers take lesson learn 2008 global financial crisis heart. theyhave impose new rule bank around capital liquidity, global financial system ismuch safe today result. here canada, authority also impose strict guidelinesaround mortgage lend help contain financial vulnerabilities. thank changes, evenif household indebtedness rise further, sustainability gradually improving.in contrast, lesson great inflation 1970s seem fade collectivememory. perhaps recent tendency inflation run target many country hasfostered degree complacency. more likely, inflation risk overwhelm deepstructural force limit economic growth, keep even long-term interest rate low.the risk surprise outbreak global inflation low. but seem combinationof elevate household government indebtedness populist politics hold inflationarypotential countries. some leader even actively question value ofinflation target need central bank politically independent. highly indebtedhouseholds might incline vote politician propose promote high inflation. the factis, great inflation 1970s result substantial transfer wealth saver toborrowers, include governments.fortunately, institutional framework canada address risk directly. thebank canada federal government agree formally transparently every five year onthe goal monetary policy. this give inflation target democratic legitimacy, whileproviding bank operational independence pursue them. importantly, canada alsomaintains flexible exchange rate, essential maintain low stable inflationdomestically, regardless development abroad.our 2020 visiongiven backdrop, veritable smorgasbord work go bank 2020. but letme focus four areas. 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech inflation-target renewalfirst inflation-targeting agreement i mentioned. the next renewal agreement isscheduled 2021. the bank us time renewal take stock experience withthe framework look seriously improvement make monetary policy.there section website follow current renewal process. here weare post new research complete provide information workshop andconferences dedicate topic. in renewal cycle go back basics,comparing alternative target frameworks—such inflation-averaging strategy nominal-gdp targeting—with inflation targeting. we also research various tool ourdisposal policy interact public policies.moreover, expand effort gather outside view issues. we beentalking wide range stakeholder groups, include business labour organizations,academics central banks. in 2020, plan hold number round table civilsociety stakeholder deepen understand economy across sector regions.as accountable public institution, eager hear views. that 2020, willconduct open, public consultation process website gather input canadiansacross country.we summarize public stakeholder consultations, well new research thesubject, website late 2020. we make recommendation governmentand hold discussion lead next formal agreement framework 2021.monetary policy financial stabilityanother important area bank next year continue embed financial stabilitylinkages monetary policy framework.let illustrate example. consider situation update economic forecastand conclude inflation likely move target. our model would suggest thatwe low interest rate stimulate economic growth bring project inflation back totarget, usually six eight quarters.now consider situation, high level financial vulnerabilities. strongereconomic growth low interest rate would make easy everyone service theirdebt. but low interest rate would also encourage buildup debt, make economicgrowth vulnerable future shock economy. in turn, could make hard toachieve inflation target sometime future.accordingly, bring financial vulnerability equation mean introduce degree offlexibility inflation-targeting process. the horizon would work getinflation back target depend severity financial vulnerabilities. of course, extentthat macroprudential policy place keep financial vulnerability check, policy-makerscan put le weight vulnerabilities.over past couple years, bank staff develop new framework help u objectivelyevaluate trade-off, call growth-at-risk model. it combine risk economic growthand inflation come macroeconomy financial vulnerability givensetting. it require lot judgment use, framework help bring rigour toour deliberation communications.the growth-at-risk framework use today prototype, base internationalexperience financial vulnerability simple macroeconomic model. work toenhance model incorporate canadian detail financial vulnerability well 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech underway enhancement deploy 2020. meanwhile, continue torefine core economic forecast model enrich linkage financial sectorand economy. we also begin scope work program next-generationeconomic model replace core structural projection model, totem (terms-of-tradeeconomic model). judge past experience, effort could take 5 10 years.the impact digitalizationa third area focus bank 2020 ass economic financial impact ofdigitalization.as i mention earlier, see evidence spread ai around us. it effect theeconomy may profound. my main message san francisco fourth industrialrevolution likely follow pattern previous three. we expect significantdisruption worker many industries. we also expect new technology lead tostronger growth sector deployed. and high productivity result willincrease economy’s potential grow. this create new job opportunity widelythroughout economy, also cause inflation fall short model wouldpredict.so far, see sign high productivity economic data. once again, theexperience previous industrial revolution instructive. in last year 1990sand early 2000s, know productivity rise quickly. but economic statistic thetime capture long fact difficult measure development innew economic sectors. it certainly possible dynamic emerge nearfuture.in 2020, bank work hard new way detect determine economicimpact fourth industrial revolution. one area show promise use ai analyze bigdata keywords build synthetic indicator technological change. michelle alexopoulosfrom university toronto, winner bank canada fellowship award, doinginnovative work area. of course, also continue talk directly canadiancompanies gather intelligence spread ai.the future moneyfinally, central banker’s favourite subject, money. technology affect howcanadians make payments, affect money too.to start with, payment canada work bank major financial institutionsto modernize core payment systems. this allow wide access innovation.the first stage replace wholesale system, 20 year old, managestransfers major financial institution bank canada operates.most work new wholesale system complete 2020.now, wholesale system handle dollar value payments. but arethousands time retail transaction give day. so, modernize retailpayments system top priority. two three year now, able executetransactions real time—a major advance today’s lags.these prospect bank think hard future money, especially cash. adecade ago, half transaction canada do cash. today, thatnumber drop one-third. it common see people tap card ortake phone make payment. canadian also business online, andmore half u send money paypal interac e-transfer. certain business havebegun accept electronic payments. 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech i believe central bank money—the bank note pocket—will always providean important public good: individual’s sovereign right make payment instrumentthat universally accept final. a private digital currency cannot deliver that, regardless ofhow widespread use may become. the nice thing cash still workeven power blackout cyber attacks. a consequence, bank note probablyalways around degree, contingency unusual events.all thing considered, then, open question whether bank canada would ever seethe need issue currency digital form substitute cash. nevertheless, world ofmoney evolve rapidly, need develop plan deal whatever contingencyarises. we say early 2020.given context, bank need think emerge payment technologies. theseinclude cryptoassets, bitcoin, well stablecoins, libra. because arepotentially global, attract attention central bank regulatory authorities.such innovation bring new risk financial system. we need understand risksand apply appropriate regulation. one area particular interest central bank cross-bordertransactions.as usual, bank work many issue 2020 i able tosummarize here. before i conclude, though, let mention one topic garner lot ofinterest lately: modern monetary theory.essentially, idea government issue currency never gobankrupt. accordingly, rather borrow public issue bonds, governmentsshould spend much newly issue money need keep economy grow andmaintain stable inflation.this sound like modern monetary theory offer free lunch, u know isno thing. first, idea monetary. government spend fiscal decision, onefor central bank. second, idea modern. it try many time past,and record pretty. for example, late 1960s u government run largefiscal deficit finance war vietnam. this lead rapid money creation. the result wasa breakdown bretton wood system fix exchange rate surge global inflationspanning 1970s. there far good mean avoid slow growth deflation—promoting innovation, provide infrastructure, remove impediment international andintranational trade, eliminate red tape—just cite obvious examples. with strong trendgrowth, fiscal monetary policy focus buff economic fluctuations.conclusionit time conclude.we see broad force low interest rates, rise debt technological change workingin combination stress households, company governments. the impact forceswill keep bank canada busy 2020 beyond. the precise way force unfoldis highly uncertain. all us—consumers, business people, policy-makers—will deal withthese source uncertainty long term.that sound challenging, i pretend otherwise. but consider broadsweep history, must admit canadian always deal powerful globalforces uncertainty, potent one face today. yet are, athriving modern economy.that say thing perfect. far it—sectors region country continue tostruggle, policy-makers lot work do. still, consider 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech past decade—the global financial crisis, subsequent slow recovery, collapse ofoil prices, political uncertainty abroad. despite that, canada’s economy operatingclose capacity, inflation target, labour force participation across almost agegroups, jobless rate near historic lows.in experience, one never underestimate ability canadian face overcomechallenges, use tool always have—hard work ingenuity.i wish best 2020. 6 / 6bis central bankers' speech i would like thank don coletti erik en help prepare speech. not publication november 19, 2019 13:00 eastern time remark carolyn a. wilkins – senior deputy governor international finance club montréal montréal, quebec november 19, 2019 financial stability uncertain worldintroduction it’s always pleasure montréal. i’d like thank international finance club montréal invitation. today, i’d like speak financial stability canada, world seem uncertain. this part commitment update canadian twice year financial-stability issue relevant them.1 the canadian economy perform relatively well overall. inflation close target, unemployment rate near historic lows, wage growth pick up. there are, nonetheless, important regional differences. the quebec economy perform particularly well past years, bring many people back work. however, ongoing adjustment low oil price continue weigh economic activity energy-producing provinces, cause hardship many people. beyond shores, global economy face immense challenges. the trade war unite state china top mind us. yes, possibility initial deal. still, uncertainty trade policy remain high. this uncertainty cause global slowdown even fear global recession—1 every spring, bank canada publish extensive assessment key vulnerability risk financial system financial system review (fsr). bank staff also conduct research throughout year keep govern council inform issue may want flag federal provincial partner tell canadian about. you find material bank’s financial system hub. -2- though baseline forecasts, include own, don’t call one. even trade war doesn’t get worse, 2021 could cost around us$1 trillion lose economic output around world. a saw late monetary policy report (mpr), canada’s hit too, domestic recession isn’t forecast either. the trade war isn’t source uncertainty. there’s brexit, tension middle east social unrest hong kong country latin america. risk manager today know difficult design business strategy environment. the bank canada authority must ass risk right safeguard place. ideally, want put winter tire snow falls. it protect you, also everyone else who’s road. i’d like spend time today make three points: 1. canada make progress tame financial vulnerability past couple years—but doesn’t mean let guard down. 2. the global context worsened, increase risk global expansion chance financial stress could spill canada. 3. in unlikely event storm, canada’s financial system resilient, good position deal whatever come way. i also share research plan major issue shape financial system—climate change. keep vulnerability check you’ve hear u say canada’s big domestic financial vulnerability high level household indebtedness imbalance house market. we worry thing weakness financial system make economic outcome far bad downside risk come pass. let’s remember year ago. household debt climb nearly 1.8 time disposable income. almost one five new borrower mortgage least 4½ time income. national house-price growth peak 20 percent (year year), increase toronto vancouver area even high stratosphere. the good news make progress. credit growth moderated, income growth pick up. so debt-to-income ratio stable past couple years. also, share new mortgage go highly indebted borrower fell low 13 percent. growth home price toronto slow sustainable pace. in vancouver, price continue fall relative last year show sign stabilizing. and expectation future price increase market come back earth. -3- these improvement didn’t happen own. federal authority make change mortgage-financing rule ensure borrower could handle high interest rate low incomes.2 british columbia ontario introduce tax measure reduce demand house non-residents speculative buyers. and bank increase policy interest rate 0.5 percent mid-2017 1.75 percent last autumn, remain today. we achieve inflation target, borrow cost rise, credit growth slows. due strict requirement high mortgage rates, people unable buy home wanted. some buy le expensive homes, others save large payment. we need remember house price would even le affordable authority leave vulnerability unchecked. this true across canada, particularly toronto vancouver. despite progress we’ve make address vulnerabilities, household debt still elevated. it likely remain high while, particularly global interest rate remain low. households’ debt-servicing cost also historic high. while seem avoid hard land house many feared, price toronto vancouver still 40 percent high 2015, pickup began. they’re also notably high market weren’t radar then, montréal. we also see mortgage credit growth house price start pick again. the market boost drop mortgage rates. and share new mortgage go highly indebted borrower start creep up.3 many ingredient present house market three year ago—namely strong underlie demand, tight supply low interest rates—are present again. this time, however, expect regulatory measure place support quality new credit mitigate buildup imbalance house market. this time let guard down, though. robust defence especially important difficulty abroad could affect u home. 2 prudential regulator alberta, saskatchewan quebec adopt similar guidelines, credit unions—on voluntary basis—in part canada. 3 mortgage rate 100 basis point since begin year weak foreign interest rates. data third quarter 2019 show share new mortgage loan-to-income ratio 450 percent great rise 13 15 percent. -4- global context cloud sky this bring second point. the global context worsened, increase risk global expansion chance financial stress. participant late financial system survey would agree.4 the trade war major concern. a i say earlier, don’t see recession likely outcome, particularly give global monetary policy condition ease recent months. it’s still job understand might happen thing go terribly wrong.5 that mean look different way perfect storm might play out. numerous financial vulnerability global level relate usual suspect: leverage. total global debt 3 time global gross domestic product (gdp), much high great recession. this leaf many households, business government expose financial situation deteriorate.6 it also mean economic downturn could deep usual fraught financial stresses. i’ve already discuss high leverage household sector canada. other country sweden australia face similar vulnerabilities. when come non-financial corporate debt, worry extend advance economies, include canada, emerge economies. the quality debt declined, 50 percent investment-grade corporate bond issue unite state europe rat bbb. in downturn, corporate profit challenged, risk bond downgraded, make costly firm fund themselves. corporate debt emerge market also exploded, investor search yield low interest-rate environment. china account around two-thirds us$30 trillion outstanding emerging-market corporate debt. non-bank financial intermediation enable lot borrowing, cross-border flow fund equity debt grow source capital flows. an increase proportion corporate bond package sell retail investor exchange-traded fund (etfs). these investor look high returns, sort liquidity associate equities. the big etf market unite states, canada’s etf market also growing. the concern 4 cyber risk also feature prominently list concerns. for detail, see highlight late financial system survey, post website yesterday. 5 in october mpr, present downside risk scenario significant rise uncertainty. this scenario capture many channel likely affect canadian economy, include foreign demand commodity prices. it also attempt capture amplification elevate household debt. it not, however, include effect financial turbulence come international markets. 6 see c. a. wilkins, “the age leverage” (remarks ubc vancouver school economics cfa society vancouver, vancouver, british columbia, march 14, 2019). -5- time stress, redemption fixed-income etf share could amplify volatility value share price underlie corporate bond market. other risky form lending, leverage loans, increasingly package collateralize loan obligation (clos), grow rapidly too.7 globally there’s us$700 billion clos outstanding issuance strong. the financial engineer behind structure improve since crisis, still room concern. for one, quality underlie loan declined, many lack usual protection covenants. the dynamic unwind complex instrument could look lot like case déjà-vu. those montréal financial crisis remember complexity financial engineer liquidity mismatch heart one problem. the first line defence risk clearly people like room— understand mitigate risk build contingency plan case something go wrong. the bank step monitor too, especially pertain non-bank financial intermediation, lead initiative build great information share among federal provincial regulators.8, 9 now, could trade war create perfect storm? what i mean perfect storm combination economic downturn financial stress. an increase uncertainty bad trade news could trigger. this, turn, could spark sharp reversal risk premium lead drop price assets, include houses. creditor would see defaults, especially corporation low credit ratings. moreover, enough investor rush adjust portfolio time, liquidity would dry up, amplify effects.10 all would find way bank system, make hard business owner family borrow intensify downturn. resilient storm pressure let turn third point: canadian financial system highly resilient. 7 leverage loan high-yield loan non-financial corporation low credit ratings. bank underwrite leverage loan issue u european markets. they sell wide range financial system participants, substantial share securitized clos. clo structure subject tight regulation global financial crisis, include stringent subordination requirement restriction asset holdings. 8 see g. bédard-pagé, “non-bank financial intermediation canada: an update,” bank canada financial system hub (march 26, 2019). 9 the bank chair head regulatory agency (hoa), federal-provincial forum discuss financial sector issues. the hoa also include department finance canada, office superintendent financial institutions, quebec autorité de marchés financiers, ontario security commission, alberta security commission british columbia security commission. 10 in may 2019 fsr, bank staff look would happen open-ended fixed-income mutual fund canada many people pull investment simultaneously. -6- canadian bank part global bank system solid decade ago. globally active bank hold us$2 trillion capital begin 2011, phase-in post-crisis reform began. this translate 7-percentage point increase tier 1 capital ratio.11 the leverage limit new liquidity regulation also make bank resilient.12 canada implement new measure strengthen bank system. for example, canada’s prudential regulator, office superintendent financial institution (osfi), increase require amount capital canada’s big bank hold protect financial-system vulnerabilities. canada introduce bail-in regime ensure investors—not taxpayers—would take brunt financial burden unlikely event big bank fail. also, osfi ask many smaller, single-business-line bank reduce reliance short-term broke funding, flighty stressful situations. the bank canada, along osfi, evaluate safeguard conduct stress test major banks. give idea plan worst, it’s important study extreme scenarios. the recent test context international monetary fund (imf)’s financial system stability assessment canada, publish june.13 the scenario use bad anything see canada recent decades. there’s recession last two years, unemployment rate increase 6 percentage points, house price fall 40 percent.14 clearly would difficult people materialize. that said, test find bank could withstand even kind severe, system-wide shock. this say effort increase resilience bank system worthwhile, would help prevent bad situation become even worse. when assess risks, it’s important look range scenarios. in october mpr, example, study impact rise uncertainty that’s large enough cause current global slowdown become significantly worse, though nearly bad imf stress test.15 our analysis find canada would hit particularly hard demand export commodity price would fall. the fact household debt high 2008 would make thing bad too. that’s indebted household face deteriorate financial situation would adjust consumption spend would past. in fact, factor amplify negative impact domestic consumption 30 percent. 11 a bank’s tier 1 capital ratio ratio equity capital total risk-weighted assets. 12 see t. gomes c. a. wilkins, “the basel iii liquidity standards: an update,” bank canada financial system review (june 2013): 37–43. 13 see international monetary fund, “canada: financial system stability assessment” (june 2019). 14 for context, unemployment rate canada rise 3 percentage point global financial crisis. 15 the simulation, box 3 october mpr, calibrate match implicit degree uncertainty participant u overnight index swap market seem see. -7- this reminder importance interaction monetary policy financial vulnerabilities. in current context, low interest rate could provide insurance downside risk inflation. however, insurance would come cost term high household vulnerability road. policy mortgage stress test i speak early would help keep vulnerability check monetary policy need accommodative.16 still, vulnerability high inflation close target year, say recent interest-rate decision take insurance wasn’t worth cost time. we also say consider appropriate path policy, we’d watch trade situation household vulnerability evolve well fiscal policy developments. it’s important note adverse scenario october mpr inflation decline stay within inflation-control range 1 3 percent. our policy interest rate may relatively low now, 1.75 percent still room manoeuvre. and, option tool kit, extraordinary forward guidance large-scale asset purchases.17 work agenda climate change before i conclude, let update research plan climate change issue relevant bank canada. the bank devote analytical firepower understand climate risk shape macroeconomy financial system. we release today multi-year research plan, outline question we’re tackling. this work focus two area central mandate. the first relate climate change could affect macroeconomic forecast monetary policy-making. to job, need understand economic impact frequent severe weather events. the flood past spring try people quebec part country. and affect broad economy. at time, we’re also think different sector economy job go could change reduce carbon footprint. at global level could affect potential output neutral rate interest. these trend particularly relevant resource-rich country like canada. the second area research relate financial-stability implication climate change. there physical risk good understand weather event become severe frequent. we see real time home: annual insurance claim 16 for detail, see s. s. poloz, “toward 2021: the power—and limitations—of policy” (remarks the chamber commerce metropolitan montreal, montréal, quebec, february 21, 2019). 17 see s. s. poloz, “prudent preparation: the evolution unconventional monetary policies” (remarks the empire club canada, toronto, ontario, december 8, 2015). -8- property infrastructure damage canada average $1.9 billion 2009 2018—up $200 million 1983 1992.18 there also risk relate transition low-carbon economy. investor already adjust portfolio reduce exposure climate-related risks, create repricing carbon-intensive assets.19 the risk transition doesn’t happen smoothly. a concrete example work come, bank canada develop model allow u ass different scenario transition. a first step, come week hope publish preliminary example kind work. we’ve also post article the economy, plain simple set climate change matter economy financial system. this start long journey, partner others make progress.20 we’re member network green financial system, productive forum central bank authorities.21 we’re also engage others good understand company investor assess mitigate climate risks. conclusion now it’s time conclude. the fact unemployment rate near historic low inflation run close target mean canadian economy relatively good place overall. still, i know canadian business worker face considerable uncertainty trade environment. and still painful adjustment underway energy-intensive regions. that’s govern council watch closely. canada make hard-won progress term stabilize household debt take froth certain house markets. let’s remember, though, debt take many year build take least many dissipate. with storm cloud gathering, can’t let guard down. this even important give high global leverage would amplify global downturn, especially become recession. it reassure storm arrive, canadian economy financial system good position weather it. 18 insurance bureau canada, 2019 fact property casualty insurance industry canada. 19 in 2018, canadian asset manager around $2 trillion asset manage explicit environmental, social governance criterion take account. 20 we also recognize it’s important leader come operations. we’ve develop multi-year strategy reduce waste start measuring—and

this reflect slowdown global economic growth, continue global trade tensionsand geopolitical risks. these restrain factor economy.regarding three-year forecast horizon, expectation changedoverall since october. we expect gdp growth rate gradually increase 1.5–2.0%in 2020 2–3% 2022. successful implementation national project provide thelargest contribution increase growth rates. this support

remarks. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 1 remark farewell dinner honour benoît cœure, member ecb executive board speech give mark carney, governor bank england european central bank, frankfurt 17 december 2019 all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 2 2 before i begin, i must emphasise might search cryptic central bank signal future policy disappointed. i speak mpc’s quiet period, comment bear whatsoever decision mpc announce thursday. this wonderful even celebrate extraordinary individual. there be, be, great joy immense gratitude. but occasion also melancholic feel end era, pass ancien regime. certainly, central bank face many challenges:  market prone severe bout illiquidity;  a global economy risk fall low growth, low inflation rut cause deep structural forces, limit policy space, grow concern fracture global trade system;  innovation private payment encroach central banks’ raison d’être, provision money;  a grow climate crisis affect every aspect finance. so tempt ask: après benoît le déluge? fortunately, financial guillotine preordained, benoît spend day power louis xv. where king grow idle, benoît remain frenetic (189 public speech eight years). where king conservative, benoît radical. where king become nostalgic, benoît always look forward. if central bank rise challenge serve citizens, need build benoît’s legacy. i. improve market function let start market functioning. before crisis, financial alchemy appear sliced, dice distribute risk want most. the revolution securitised derivative finance cheer policymakers saw market solution market failure believe lie market always clear. but course market always clear textbooks. in reality, people irrational, economy imperfect, nature unknowable. the pre-crisis system merely spread risk, contingently opaquely, way often increase it. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 3 3 once crisis began, risk quickly concentrate balance sheet intermediary capital constrained. and fate borrower lender tie together via hyper-globalised bank markets, problem core spread violently periphery. the post-crisis response include major reform simplify market make robust. a vital plank encourage great central clear otc trades, prior crisis largely unregulated, unreported bilaterally settled. when lehman fell, uncertainty exposure spark panic. rout bilateral trade central counterparties untangle tangle web. globally, stock centrally clear derivative double since crisis.1 and around two-thirds outstanding interest rate derivative uk europe clear ccps.2 of course, central clear mean ccps source systemic risk, benoît lead effort build resilience improve resolvability. a chair committee payment market infrastructure (cpmi), oversee implementation principle financial market infrastructure – set demanding, international standard payment, clear settlement system ensure ccps robust shocks. a result, additional $1 trillion collateral hold globally derivative trades. under benoît’s leadership, cpmi work authority finalise implement global standard resolution. and consistently encourage great cross-border cooperation, good information share coordinate stress testing. whilst infrastructure underpin market much good shape, nascent risk remain that, leave unchecked, could bring new problems. consider market liquidity. during crisis, liquidity dry up, particularly interbank market, cash-rich bank hoard excess funds. in parallel, “run repo”, trigger increase haircut collateral guard counterparty risk, push shadow bank sector advance economy collapse. in euro area, sovereign debt crisis compound problems, cause market splinter along national lines. global reform address fault line cause fiasco. new global standard liquidity regulation place include liquidity coverage ratio net stable fund ratio. bank capital standard take account exposure shadow banks, include step-in risk, through-the-cycle margining prevent minsky cycle secure lending. 1 see https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r191118-1-1.pdf. 2 see https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50_157_2025_asr_derivatives.pdf. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 4 4 these reform transform banks’ approach liquidity management build resilience system whole. for example, liquid asset – relative liability readily run – tenfold high crisis. however, recent volatility u dollar repo market suggest still friction need addressed. contrary expectations, bank step market lend cash, view profit opportunity insufficient offset impact perceive regulatory liquidity requirements. the federal reserve’s open market operation since calm market, term repo rate remain elevated, dealer price high likelihood similar spike future. while may tempt conclude isolate incident, others, include taper bund tantrums. these could signal broad problem discontinuous market liquidity stress. the solution unwind post-crisis liquidity regulation, recidivism would recreate, time, enormous systemic risk past. moreover, limit systemic consequence event noted. after all, riskiness asset depend hold it. a “crisis” periphery bad day markets; one core annus horribilis real economy. nevertheless, market infrastructure must evolve take account new dynamics. in one benoît’s (many) speech last month, identify one potential problem underlie repo market stress: may look sufficient liquidity aggregate prove little asymmetrically distribute – either across institution national boundaries. a benoît noted, may require central bank provide liquidity aggregate, include widen access balance sheets. prompt potential risk come brexit, bank england come similar conclusion: already run weekly auction sterling, u dollar euro could use absorb pressure arise. we also contingent term repo facility could activate high frequency needed; – like ecb – lend broad range counterparties wide range collateral. central bank regulator must also clear liquidity facility buff used. for example, october, bank clarify supervisory expectation re-emphasise commitment provide liquidity ordinary course business. we expect firm justify usage, presumption would use buff facilities. next year’s first system-wide liquidity stress test another opportunity demonstrate liquidity buff fully useable. increase central clear would capital-efficient way improve repo market liquidity; would effective small institution participate directly. and holistic approach firm internal capital management would make agile, include apply leverage ratio desk level. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 5 5 liquidity concern also go heart otherwise immensely positive development market-based finance. a case banks, institution heart market-based finance, particularly open-ended investment funds, must prudently manage leverage liquidity. mismatch redemption term liquidity funds’ asset mean advantage investor redeem ahead others, particularly stress. this potential become systemic risk first mover advantage could prompt de-stabilising rush exits. in response, bank england fca decide great consistency liquidity fund’s asset redemption terms. specifically:  the liquidity funds’ asset assess either price discount need quick sale vertical slice asset time period need sale avoid material price discount.  investor redeem receive price unit reflect discount need sell require proportion fund’s asset specify redemption notice period;  redemption notice period reflect time need sell require proportion fund’s asset without discount beyond capture price receive redeem investors. our next step consider principle could implement and, particular, stress liquidity measure redemption term calibrated. we expect publish review’s conclusion summer will, appropriate, inform development uk standard open-ended funds. our conclusion also inform international engagement example fsb, iosco competent authority financial stability risk asset management activity. ii. create monetary policy space effective market function matter price stability well financial stability. during crisis, impair bank system dysfunctional corporate debt market mute transmission monetary stimulus lead inefficiency risk-sharing capital allocation. ultimately, company household bore heavy cost. strain monetary policy transmission particularly pronounce euro area, fragmentation market along national line mean cut ecb’s policy rate pass equally countries. household company comparable credit worthiness face different borrow rate depend location. these problem worsen 2012, market begin price redenomination risk euro-area countries. it fell benoît fellow member ecb’s govern council fix problem. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 6 6 throughout crisis, ecb rightly swiftly inject huge quantity additional reserve system, asset-backed commercial paper interbank market dry up. in response worsen sovereign debt crisis 2012, govern council create outright monetary transactions, programme whose existence eliminate unwarranted self-reinforcing fear euro-area break-up restore sovereign bond spread level consistent credit rather currency risk. during time, benoît add voice call capital market union, least would broaden transmission mechanism increase potency monetary policy. he also recognise ecb’s action could tackle symptom financial market fragmentation. address root cause require strong banks, resilient financial system, solvent governments, delinking bank sovereign credit risk. on two imperatives, eu make welcome progress, establishment single supervisory mechanism european systemic risk board. these body help address classic collective action problem overcome inevitable temptation national supervisor ring-fence liquidity capital within national boundary detriment single market capital. alongside improve transmission mechanism, ecb make important advance conduct monetary policy. it reduce effective low bind policy rate create additional stimulus forward guidance, new lend facility innovative asset purchase programmes. these action help shape expectation market participant general public. the challenge face ecb – monetary policy maker broadly – provide sufficient stimulus meet price stability objective powerful structural force push equilibrium interest rates. a i note jackson hole,3 risk global liquidity trap put high premium get monetary policy right. in global liquidity trap, central bank cannot policy maker “whatever takes.” there clear gain coordination, policy – particularly fiscal policy – important roles. the big gain would come low trade tensions. this push hurdle rate investment, swamp impact low policy rates. reduce uncertainty would turn vicious cycle – fall equilibrium interest rate eat policy space, exacerbate downside risk push equilibrium rate – virtuous one, rise equilibrium rates, increase policy space, strong global growth. 3 “the grow challenge monetary policy current international monetary financial system”, speech mark carney jackson hole symposium 2019. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 7 7 iii. transform payment during benoît’s time ecb, public provision money face challenge bitcoin stablecoins. the bank england open mind open door come innovations. unlike social media, standard regulation develop technology adopt billion users, term engagement new systemic private payment system must force well advance launch. and host issue still need address – maintain high standard operational resilience manage financial risks, address privacy anti-money launder concerns. like benoit, recognise initiative conceive vacuum; rather seek address long-standing problem payments. despite ongoing revolution online commerce, payment often expensive need still take long clear. uk card payment convenient popular mean payment, cost 0.5% 2% total transaction value, take three day merchant receive money. the scope improve cross border payment big still. these cost 10 time domestic equivalent. anti-money launder check rightly require cumbersome. settlement slow, money take week reach recipient. during time ecb, benoît oversee significant progress build pan-european payment system wholesale side. nonetheless, development retail payment lagged. euro-area customer start turn non-european card make non-cash payments. last month, sense opportunity another speech, benoît announce ecb’s govern council relaunching retail payment strategy. the goal create retail payment system convenient, cost-effective, safe secure operate across border across shop counter; one work well merchant outside eu within it. deliver good retail payment experience require ecb bank england provide best-in-class payment infrastructure enable private innovator deliver payment product service citizen need. we intend collaborate closely, share perspective policy issue technical designs. and look forward leverage advancement arise benoît’s new role lead bi innovation hub. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 8 8 innovation best achieve empower competition. for bank, mean level play field old new allow new entrant access resource incumbents, hold similar risk similar standards. it also mean update public infrastructure enable state-of-the-art private sector solution emerge low costs, increase speed improve customer experience domestic international payments. any new payment system must efficient, resilient secure. a safe payment system useful people use it, mean must deliver fast, user-friendly inclusive services. this turn require payment system open innovation competition, build around comparative advantage central bank private sector. address climate crisis my final challenge face central bank fundamental. indeed, existential. four year since paris agreement, sustainable financial system built. it’s fund private sector innovation, potential amplify effectiveness government climate policies, could accelerate transition net zero economy. but must go much world reach net zero carbon emissions. disclosure must become comprehensive. risk management must transformed. sustainable invest must go mainstream. in short, every financial decision must take climate change account. achieve require improvement three rs: reporting, risk management return.  on reporting, tcfd standard must enhance comparable, efficient decision-useful possible. and need develop pathway mandatory climate disclosures.  to manage risks, disclosure need go beyond static strategic. we must ass resilience core financial system transition risks, include stress testing. the bank publish discussion paper plan climate stress test tomorrow look forward take forward internationally network green financial system (ngfs).  on returns, asset manager asset owner increasingly ass transition path investment report impact clients. our citizen need able see whether investment consistent path net zero. central bank cannot stand side line revolution. and benoit’s research christine’s leadership, i confident ecb vanguard. conclusion all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 9 9 benoît, behalf everyone tonight, i’d like thank tremendous work ecb chair cpmi. the flood acclaim you’ve receive rightly bestowed. you provide exemplary leadership, drive progress improve function payment system broad financial market infrastructure, within euro area internationally. if anyone prepare u withstand come deluge, it’s you. whether remark leave see world’s glass half full half empty, i’d ask charge toast, benoît cœure. gent sejko: transparency, communication importance ofthe medium

follow medium report monetary policy probably note i consider dovish member riksbank’s executive board time. by this, i mean i consider one who, least time being, incline conduct expansionary policy. for anyone unfamiliar terminology, opposite dive hawk, some-one instead advocate tight monetary policy. an alternative terminology common theoretical model hawkish policy instead attache considerable importance inflation target give le weight things.1 so actually, i think justify prioritise inflation target confidence it, i could also consider hawk. more precisely, i could de-scribed combination inflation hawk interest-rate dove. describe orientation monetary policy-makers ornithological term ra-ther practical. apparently, however, entirely uncomplicated miss subtle differences. i would therefore like start elaborate view current monetary policy reason recent monetary policy meetings. the picture give monetary policy minute easily become little compress i would therefore like provide slightly compre-hensive cohesive account here. after that, i intend address slightly fundamental issues. more specifically, i would like give view advantage current framework, inflation target float exchange rate. i feel debate last year bias towards emphasise disadvantage system positive aspect overshadow perhaps even entirely forgotten. i think good remind people again. * i would like thank mikael apel help write speech charlotta edler, mattias erlandsson, re-becka hallerby, jesper hansson, marie hesselman, åsa olli segendorf, marianne sterner, ulf söderström, emelie theobald comments. 1 see, example, orphanides williams (2003). 2 [17] communication great importance to describe perhaps important basis policy i recently advocated, i would like start refer back speech i make two year ago. it concern international ideological debate monetary policy lesson i think could learn development sweden.2 one lesson i highlight important lose sight inflation inflation expectations. what i mind period 2011 year onwards inflation sweden unexpectedly low periodi-cally inflation target quite wide margin. once inflation under-shot target while, long-term inflation expectation also begin fall. in addition, signal labour market party inflation tar-get long give starting-point wage negotiations. in words, risk begin arise confidence inflation target would weaken extent target would long function anchor price-setting wage formation. a well known, eventually manage reverse develop-ment bring inflation target again, take long time re-quired expansionary policy, well slice good fortune. an important reason inflation low long debt crisis europe hit financial crisis analyst see coming, least much force soon. it slow recovery begin cause economic activity deteriorate again, drag inflation process. the riksbank underestimate inflation effects, far alone so.3 that expectation gradually follow actual in-flation downwards perhaps strange take while, least me, understand serious situation become. another factor may contribute fall inflation expectations, i also raise speech year ago, riksbank communi-cated monetary policy time. overheat structurally deficient house market exacerbate effect financial debt crisis many coun-tries. concern would also happen sweden make u direct much communication towards highlight risk associate development debt house prices. even though forecast still make clear strive fulfil inflation target also emphasise com-munication, may well case talk little much risk financial imbalance little little importance infla-tion close target. this may create uncertainty among economic agent regard actual status inflation target, and, turn, may contribute weak confidence inflation target. the emerge suspi-cion perhaps we, speak, take eye ball.4 2 jansson (2017). 3 during first half 2013, example, average swedish forecaster expect inflation barely reach 1.5 per cent 2014. the outcome almost one percentage point lower, is, one half percentage point target. 4 that may good deal truth interpretation support number critical newspaper article publish around time, see, example, “nya direktörer men samma gamla riksbank” [new direc-tors old riksbank], aftonbladet (2013), 22 may “ta tillbaka makten över riksbanken” [take back control riksbank], dagens nyheter (2014), 15 june. 3 [17] the important lesson learn is, i see it, absolutely key show always eye ball let factor come picture way risk economic actor start doubt case. i remind lesson number occasion lately, re-cently monetary policy meet october. the picture paint time monetary policy go forward, predict repo rate raise slowly take back positive territory long term, one i largely consider well-balanced. however, i express con-siderable doubt next increase repo rate happen early around turn year, probably next meet december, imply forecast repo rate. there several reason i think good idea. first, fore-cast inflation would remain target near term, expect stabilise 2 per cent late 2022. of importance also fact i could see appreciable upside risk inflation fore-cast either. second, i saw it, increase interest rate near future could hardly expect lead great probability downward trend inflation expectation reversing. this worry quite considerably af-fect inflation rate labour market organisation base forth-coming wage negotiations. third, i felt reason worry con-sequences federal reserve ecb increase monetary pol-icy stimulus sweden, announce rate rise implemented, would go opposite direction. many analyst also interpret signal meet october riksbank view abolition negative rate end itself. this apply analyst sweden also internationally. a couple example article bloomberg financial times, author argue riksbank realise problem negative interest rate therefore keen get away them.5 a number analyst also specu-lated riksbank see zero level important would wary low repo rate come year even economic outlook inflation prospect deteriorate. my view that, result this, may risk several people start make interpretation indeed take eye ball certain extent, least don’t sharply focus usually have. too low average inflation create problem let elaborate bite this. if repo rate raise soon around turn year, serious aspect interest rate would 0.25 percentage point higher, although someone prefer un-changed rate, course advantage either. the problem in-stead might perceive riksbank deviate normally 5 gordon, skolimowski stirling (2019), milne (2019). an alternative view riksbank simply become difficult interpret, see, example, boije (2019). 4 [17] does: design monetary policy always clear inflation target point departure. this course particularly important situa-tions risk confidence inflation target start evapo-rate. consequently, “the tenths” important – course even le important normal circumstances. but confidence inflation target stake, even tenth send signal something i think one well advise consider. let stress i course believe colleague executive board also take argument like consideration. however, certainly case make different assessment important are. this natu-ral way whole point executive board. what i present way look thing personal assessments. a necessary condition maintain confidence inflation target is, i see it, monetary policy conduct plan conduct mean antici-pate inflation 2 per cent least end forecast period considering. if inflation forecast 2 per cent even time perspective, monetary policy, inflation forecast based, wrong must adjust it. but i discussing, always enough – sufficient condition. even though inflation forecast line target, act communicate way make unclear important consider inflation target – bad case repeat oc-casions – economic agent sooner late start doubt intentions. if doubt take hold, inflation expectation economy may start fall. economic agent may start expect low inflation 2 per cent even long term, ultimately also begin incorporate economic deci-sions. in case, self-reinforcing process arise lead average inflation “getting stuck” low level. but would really problematic? yes, i think would be. that i commit advocate inflation target consider 2-per-cent target “holy”, sake it. it im-portant economic perspective inflation rise high, also fall low. i often discuss argument this, worth repeating. there two aspect i think make important maintain confi-dence inflation target 2 per cent indicate target lower. one that, average inflation low, become difficult wage formation distribute resource economy effi-ciently. the reason prove difficult practice low nominal wages. if inflation low nominal wage cannot lowered, become difficult adjust real wage different professions, company sec-tors. this ultimately lead high unemployment poor productiv-ity growth economy. a moderate level inflation mitigate prob-lems. it function grease wheel economic machinery. another advantage inflation target 2 per cent, come fore recent years, create least scope low policy rate reach low bound. if inflation target, hence average 5 [17] inflation, lower, nominal rate would also average lower. this would particularly problematic world real interest rate low, currently case. the scope low rate reach low bind would limit today, would make difficult counteract future recessions. therefore, one like negative interest rates, one advocate low inflation target, would imply policy rate would negative long peri-ods. in international debate, moreover, several economist think even inflation target 2 per cent provide sufficient scope conduct expansive monetary policy sometimes necessary. so sound economic argument inflation target low 2 per cent. to sum up, consideration i mind i talk im-portance keep eye ball. basically, question constantly be-ing clear guide role inflation target design mone-tary policy. the low bind repo rate le zero regard negative interest rates, i present view matter speech around time last year.6 i think difficulty negative rate much question purely economic aspects, rather fea-sible accord social convention possible create understand for. for example, big problem probably one commonly high-lighted, namely general public would choose empty bank ac-counts hold cash, soon interest rate negative. hold save cash is, come it, troublesome costly give people sweden start abandon cash, something would seem particularly natural. the pain threshold probably relatively high, purely economic perspective. on hand, i strongly suspect would difficult gain understand-ing policy involve private individual also encounter negative rate deposit accounts; word “pay save”. this perhaps limitation simply accepted. ultimately, legitimacy of, con-fidence in, independent institution like riksbank base general public understand policy conducted, least consider il-logical unjust. but exactly i think constitute limitation. that zero per cent magical limit repo rate diffi-cult understand, however.7 6 jansson (2018). 7 it worth note real yield bank account often negative, even nominal rate positive. that negative nominal interest rate special is, sense, example so-called “money illusion”. that said, i realise course figure zero particularly psychological significance many contexts. when zero (and negative figures) introduce mathematics, was, example, meet long time con-fusion even loathing, see, instance, wei (2017). 6 [17] during almost three year repo rate –0.5 per cent, normal bank-saver deposit rate never become negative, seem nevertheless scope negative interest rates. and bear mind monetary policy resource inexhaustible, i think good able make use scope thereby help avoid major cost economy. if take long reach target, mean would give i make point early important monetary policy communi-cated. before i go on, allow discus hypothetical case make partic-ularly clear central point is. it secret low real interest rate reduce scope manage cyclical fluctuation help mone-tary policy. in speech three year ago, i say could rule might stage reach point consider long desirable make monetary policy expansionary.8 if find situation – i say – may consequence accept take long normally attain inflation target. the advantage i describe inflation target 2 per cent would course still apply would continue best attain target. the differ-ence would open possibility could take long normally expect, accept without make monetary policy ex-pansionary. in hypothetical case, would thus “give inflation target” suddenly start conduct entirely different policy and, example, raise interest rate. there would still reason conduct policy expansion-ary deem possible, avoid take long necessary attain tar-get. however, one consequence might riksbank’s communication be-comes even

happen, least quarters. the debate slightly different angles. one line reason criticise policy conduct riksbank, although always clear, least, extent criticism direct policy – i.e. take wrong action give target – target definition itself. the monetary policy mandate give riksbank riksdag short keep inflation time close enough 2 per cent long-term in-flation expectation economy anchor level. more le central bank western country float exchange rate main task target level, example norge bank, bank eng-land federal reserve. broad support inflation target before continuing, allow digress little subject riksbank’s mandate. those follow current debate certainly gain impression riksbank unilaterally adopt monetary policy target think appropriate – 2 per cent inflation – quite controversial rest society. in words, inflation target riksbank’s riks-bank’s. this interpretation is, however, incorrect unfortunate. so whose inflation target, then? the decision introduce inflation tar-get 2 per cent take 1993 general council riksbank. at time, general council different role one today riksbank’s decision-making body. the governor, bengt dennis, describe prevail regime follow (dennis, 2003, p. 182): “the general council con-sisted eight members. seven member elect riksdag eighth, governor riksbank, appoint general council. it council elect political grind majority member active politicians”. at outset, inflation target receive fair amount criticism, even politicians. but quite soon, advantage target become clearer, broad support emerge it. for many year now, riksdag commit-tee finance perform review monetary policy every year also task two foreign economist review monetary policy. these review largely concern policy riksbank conduct course nothing principle prevent framework issue addressed, also happen occasion. if committee finance foreign reviewer consider inflation target 2 per cent inappropriate, reasonable assume would communicate point twenty-five year target force. but happened. thus, elect representative play key role introduction target, always support it, least majority them, nothing 8 [17] suggest long case.9 a i see it, approximately crite-rion able call inflation target “sweden’s” inflation target. so “riksbank’s” target, even though course riksbank’s task try attain it. good target attainment recent year with that, i return debate monetary policy framework. the riks-bank perform task rather successfully recent years. in term tar-get variable cpif, inflation close 2 per cent past two year well first half 2019, albeit help in-crease energy prices. it recent month inflation fall back somewhat do largely result low contribution energy prices. many critical policy conduct riksbank claim support monetary policy framework inflation target. but bear mind aim monetary policy keep inflation around target maintain confidence it, riksbank work quite hard achieve this, seem far-fetched conclude criticism im-plicitly nevertheless target different. this true least one belief monetary policy could different been. and exactly opinion many critic must perceive have; otherwise difficult understand discussion lively. in context, worth emphasise expansionary policy con-ducted riksbank enough bring inflation 2 per cent. inflation never excessively high recent years, contrary recently fall back somewhat target. it there-fore difficult see we, speak, go far view target. i think reasonable claim support monetary policy framework inflation target, nevertheless critical pol-icy conducted, take consideration. the inflation target considerable benefits... apart criticism, also line reason state clearly target definition different. it part debate i concentrate discussion go forward. i would like go deep two specific areas: wage formation exchange rate. it fail-ures two area particular caused, rather forced, sweden 9 it is, example, worth note term reference recently present riksbank inquiry make clear baseline “the objective price stability shall remain central” (swedish ministry finance, 2016, p. 1). 9 [17] switch monetary policy regime today float ex-change rate inflation target. to provide background continue discussion, allow describe situation prior inflation targeting. since early 1970s, sweden stick could call devalua-tion cycle. peg exchange rate, least theory, set target domestic inflation. the idea domestic rate cannot exceed (or fall below) inflation country domestic currency pegged, least long period time. but order make commitment maintain fix exchange rate credible, must support policies. this case sweden. a expectation continue high in-flation swedish krona devalued, word target exchange rate abandon sooner later, wage inflation trend sweden strong abroad. a exchange rate fixed, competitiveness swedish company weaken cost crisis arose. to rec-tify this, solution devalue krona think available, mean expectation krona’s devaluation met. this turn mean inflation trend could continue, competitiveness gradually weaken again, exchange rate adjust downwards, on. what normally refer “the nominal anchor” – benchmark in-flation expectation thus price-setting wage formation – func-tion intended. it far obvious inflation targeting, introduce 1993, would succeed achieve fix exchange-rate policy fail – re-establish anchor price-setting wage formation. today, know succeed furthermore relatively quickly. if i pick important contribution make inflation targeting, would precisely – provide nominal anchor economy. a far sweden concerned, quite clear inflation target help provide great orderliness play role, probably important explanation swedish econ-omy develop favourably since crisis begin 1990s. … benefit seem begin fall oblivion a i note earlier, broad support inflation target. but regard wage formation, currently opinion, least quarters, inflation target play part become irrelevant: it important bring wage inflation high level 1970s 1980s, achieved, target long fulfil function might well abolished. for several reasons, i see historically questionable my-opic argument, would unfortunate view gain firm foot-hold. first, always sensible let oneself influence much prevail-ing situation discuss design framework expect stable place long time. it course true kind inflation 10 [17] wage surge see 1970s 1980s seem likely fore-seeable future. but end day, really know situation year future? even inflation subdue recent years, likely arrive “the end inflation” eternity. inflation always vary never constantly high low particular length time (see figure 1). it difficult see society could change fundamentally historical regularity long applies. as-sume inflation, reason cannot currently identify, be, say, 4 per cent year ahead. even consider inflation target become irrelevant would probably see benefit credible anchor 2 per cent. a credible inflation target stabilise wage formation, inflation unexpectedly high unexpectedly low. second, unclear might replace inflation target anchor price wage economy. one possibility course sweden revert fix exchange rate. this something i return shortly. my interpreta-tion, however, think inflation target run course wage formation predominantly advocate return fix exchange rate. instead, seem rely wage formation reform sufficient. accord reforms, collectively know industrial agreement, industry has, twenty years, set bench-mark wage negotiation thereby steer wage growth entire economy. in way, international competitiveness take account swedish wage set. the industrial agreement definitely fulfil important function regard bring control wage formation restrain wage increases. but broad economic perspective, difficult see agreement labour market party could constitute sufficiently stable anchor price wage entire economy, order able replace infla-tion target. a far i aware, sweden would first country world abandon inflation target order rely system instead. the way try provide economy nominal anchor currently employ either directly via inflation target indirectly via fix ex-change rate. important discus condition wage formation in recent years, number challenge regard system whereby indus-try set benchmark wage negotiation rest economy increasingly discussed. one aspect address standardisation make difficult change relative wages, might call per-spective fairness distribution. for example, obstacle reduc-ing wage gap woman men. but problem also high-lighted macroeconomic perspective. if relative wage flexible enough, could counteract economically effective distribution labour force among profession sectors. this could turn create imbalance labour market. many analyst argue that, instead important aim 11 [17] wage formation safeguard international competitiveness industry, achieve balance labour market whole.10 another important aspect highlight discussion extent wage standardisation always compatible inflation-targeting regime. the reason highlight issue strikingly low overall nominal wage growth economy despite healthy economic situation le on-target inflation. that wage agreement swedish industry restrain due large extent modest wage growth european competitor countries, probably many country hit hard interna-tional financial crisis subsequent european debt crisis. a agreement industry also set standard wage agreement sector partly expose competition, agreement also low. from theoretical perspective, type wage standardisation incompatible inflation target long term euro area’s inflation target much line sweden’s. but period wage growth euro area unusually low, standardisation base industrial sector contrib-utes low wage growth swedish economy well. even though riks-bank would make monetary policy expansionary situation, in-flation target may take long normal attain. during periods, risk inflation expectation fall confidence inflation target weakening. this would good swedish economy. we could get stick situation low average inflation nominal interest rates, long period negative rate great difficulty counteract reces-sions via monetary policy. a general challenge fact constantly ongoing structural trans-formation change playing-field. it already highlight de-bate labour shortage part labour market, primarily pub-licly fund activities, also increase year ahead demographic reasons. substantial real wage increase necessary order meet staff requirements. another aspect new expose sector gradually emerging, service companies. the longer-term consequence relatively limit probably decrease part economy set benchmark entire labour market therefore something ig-nore refrain discuss (see figure 2). the interaction monetary policy framework condition wage formation important issue analyse. the riksbank shall, course, strive directly influence wage formation try steer agreement particular direction. it labour market party determine this. but perception start spread inflation target irrelevant scrapped, have, give mandate, obligation bring discussion point consider problem. when come 10 see, instance, calmfors (2018) calmfors et al. (2019). it point study indicate certain amount wage flexibility regard change unemployment regional level, see carlsson et al. (2019). 12 [17] it, sweden country inflation target 2 per cent industrial sector expose international competition. important perspective krona development let go area i wish delve deep into; exchange rate development krona. when sweden introduce inflation target 1993, choose exchange-rate regime time. a i point out, fix exchange rate inflation target float exchange rate two different way try provide economy nominal anchor, is, benchmark price-setting wage formation. an inflation target try steer expectation economy directly, fix exchange rate try steer indirectly, virtue become costly price increase wage growth high abroad. a established, latter discipli-nary mechanism work well sweden. so remain test inflation target. my firm conviction is, i already touch upon, political system clearly support system inflation target 2 per cent float ex-change rate, perception apply large majority swedish people. it reasonable assume therefore also expect riksbank maintain confidence inflation target. it would odd idea sweden to, one hand, inflation target that, hand, important target credible, riksbank try ensure case. if view confidence inflation target important, follows, least follow, acceptance that, riksbank conduct expansionary policy maintain confidence inflation target, krona exchange rate affected. this occur via normal exchange-rate channel monetary policy, say, low interest rate relation abroad make le profitable hold financial asset swedish kronor currencies. the demand kronor decrease krona exchange rate depreciates. development krona weak year doubt one reason indeed exchange-rate channel expansionary policy maintain confidence inflation target. it would strange case partly monetary policy works. but, important ‘but’, far whole picture. it obvious another part explanation currency small, open economy tend depreciate turbulence world. for example norwegian krone new zealand dollar experience similar development swedish krona recent years, despite policy rate norway new zealand 1.50 1 per cent respectively, say significantly high sweden (figure 3). this important observation consider criticism level swedish inflation-targeting regime. it give perspective to, among aspects, “krona collapse” often highlight debate. 13 [17] but one hold view movement krona acceptable, one course argue return fix exchange rate. this would, how-ever, political decision nothing riksbank decide on. under currency rate act, government take decision exchange-rate system applied.11 if one argue fix exchange rate, reasonable one explain cost float exchange rate become great. a far i concerned, i cannot see happened. on general level, one need explain general benefit fix exchange rate consider great float rate, include latter function shock-absorber time crisis. if one think krona retain tie euro, example, course ad-vantage if, light past negative experiences, one convince story type arrangement would work time. it also possible go step argue favour sweden abolish krona introduce euro instead. this obviously even big deci-sion basically irrevocable. if one belief adopt euro would good idea, i sure possible find several good reason so. but i cannot see one would inflation-targeting regime ineffective make u poor people nation. my important message let round summarise main messages. i start present reason recent monetary policy meetings. here key argument i find crucial clear guide role inflation target design monetary policy. if clarity lacking, risk self-reinforcing process emerge lead average inflation “getting stuck” low level. such development would problematic, least would lead policy rate negative long periods. i discuss current framework inflation target float ex-change rate point principle. here main purpose remind people positive aspect framework, experience debate recent year bias towards emphasise disadvantages. i dis-cussed respond two argument occur debate: inflation target long relevant benchmark wage formation krona’s development recent year show cost float exchange rate become great. the framework inflation target float exchange rate, launch 1993, perfect situation events. but unfortu-nately, perfect system exist interest question whether good alternative. this remind winston churchill’s evaluation democ-racy form government: 11 currency rate act (1998:1404), section 2. 14

the financial crisis show macroprudential policy need complement supervisory scrutiny account system-wide macro-financial feedback loops. macroprudential policy call act countercyclically, tighten requirement see excessive risk-taking loosen avoid credit crunch risk materialise.since crisis, resilience euro area bank improve significantly capital level currently consider adequate. however, addition level capital, also composition deserve appropriate consideration. the macroprudential buff currently implement ssm bank system predominantly structural nature thus expect maintain cycle.[9]the countercyclical capital buff (ccyb) buff intend release case downturn. however, ccyb activate seven 19 euro area country currently represents, aggregate, 0.1% risk-weighted asset [10]a lack releasable buff curb countercyclical role macroprudential authorities. when breach combine buff requirements, bank may uphold capital ratio dispose asset avoid automatic restriction dividend distributions. if behaviour become widespread event systemic stress, result credit crunch, would aggravate downturn. this exactly observe previous crisis episodes, avoid future.macroprudential space form releasable buff could serve potential macro-financial stabilisation euro area countries. the release buff downturn help bank sustain flow credit. to end, releasable buff would first need available. in sum, situation overall level capital requirement broadly adequate, composition may optimal. it therefore important discussion need reallocate capital requirement towards releasable buff capital-neutral manner. other national authority – – similar discussions, unite kingdom unite states.[11]to me, reallocation appear make sense current environment heighten uncertainty risk tilt downside. with reallocation buffers, cyclical systemic risk factor – common entire bank sector – would cover appropriately ccyb. in turn, remain idiosyncratic bank-specific risk continue cover microprudential requirements. the reallocation would capital-neutral result increase ccyb would offset correspond decrease capital requirements, example pillar 2, do bank england.the capital-neutral creation releasable buff require regulatory change. indeed, ccyb already enshrine eu law transpose national context. it use address cyclical systemic risk common entire bank sector. to ensure relevant risk bank sector continue appropriately cover call continue close cooperation among relevant authorities. this include close coordination among micro- macroprudential authority well ecb national macroprudential authorities. national authority continue remain first line deploy ccyb address change systemic risk jurisdiction.concluding remarkslet conclude. the current macro-financial environment become challenging. the lower-for-longer interest rate environment create strain bank profitability implication financial stability. this imply need build analytical toolkit identify risk devise coherent policy response. it call intensify outreach state-of-the-art research academia analytical work in-house. a mention earlier, deepen understand interplay monetary macroprudential policy key priority low-for-longer interest rate environment. furthermore, aim good capture interaction banks, market participant real economy fully integrate macroprudential stress-testing framework combine macro micro build blocks. this require estimate model behaviour financial non-financial agent realistically capture balance sheet adjustment also time stress.on policy side, key priority become agile fulfil countercyclical macroprudential policy mandate. we need ensure releasable buff available enable bank system support real economy downturn. at present, best option set ccyb capital-neutral manner able withstand current headwinds.i wish u insightful conference.[1]see, instance, van d ghote, a.

finance consumption1.i would like thank colleague central bank ireland ecb hard work organise promise fascinate network event. look programme, range topics; inflation, housing, credit, business cycles, inequality, demographic change, course, monetary policy, you’re stimulate couple days.what i see common thread across diverse range issue ultimately, good data inform good policy. like many policy institutions, decade ago, crisis, prompt u reflect type data collect, analysed, and, crucially, analysis fee policy decisions. the work you, network, discus today, critical make policy, decide, affect society. but it’s important don’t think gap data emerge past. we also need develop data area grow change recently, non-bank, market base finance. finally, today, i wish note data enhance debate policy discussion unavailable. for example, today central bank ireland launch report national claim information database (ncid), report add important number fact widely debate topic ireland.understanding household balance sheet data, the irish household finance consumption survey (2013), provide really important insight household finance wake crisis. we know high-leverage household twice likely face credit constraints, even control different income shock face household (leblanc & lydon 2019). the cross-country evidence paint similar picture – amongst euro area household 2013/14, irish household indebted likely credit constrain – almost one-in-five household time (ibid). heavily indebted household reduce spend significantly response give income shock. this partly explain ireland experience one large drop consumer spend great recession, slow recovery consumer spend (ibid).today, consumer spend almost back pre-recession levels, provide significant support domestic demand and, crucially, employment (cso 2019).although, i note time spend growth accompany build-up household indebtedness. in fact, since 2016 – period consumer spend growth average around three per cent per year – household debt-to-income ratio fall 31 percentage points, 151 120 per cent (central bank 2019).beyond aggregate, distributional effect economic outcome key theme macro model (moll, 2017). issue like distribution income, wealth debt increasingly discuss central bank circles. it important understand different shock policy choice affect different group society, difference influence aggregate outcome (ampudia et al, 2018). and possible now, precisely advent good data like household finance consumption survey. not bring macro theory line reality, also allow difference behaviour across income wealth distribution good reflect models. one interest find extent monetary stimulus reduce income inequality boost income employment low income household (lenza et al, 2018). i look forward hear philip’s lunch-time remarks, well conference tomorrow. and refer micro household finance data monetary policy, course lengthy discussion role micro data monetary policy widely

affect households’ response income wealth shocks. a lack resilience spill real economy make longer, deeper, recessions. the irish experience last two decade pave way u collect loan level data develop

macro-prudential policy strengthen resilience economy adverse shocks, well reduce cyclical movement credit asset price prove detrimental past. rigorous data drive analysis part policy design, assessment calibration (central bank, 2019).as economists, always interest new data, look topic different angle, different lens. look forward, central bank ireland’s central credit register anacredit two source may able add analysis household firm resilience. we also also look forward new pension fund data come stream shortly. pension asset represent second large financial asset irish households. the new dataset will, first time, allow u look granular hold within fund good understand risk exposure households.non-bank financial intermediationthe last crisis highlight need good data understand, good policy strengthen, balance sheet resilience household lenders. however must careful focus resource data gap expose past. we also need develop tool understand world changed. one area growth since crisis non-bank financial intermediation, otherwise refer market base finance. the eurosystem’s household finance consumption survey (hfcs) provide important information mismatch asset liability individual households, term size, volatility, interest rate sensitivity liquidity. many question address data parallel issue face policymakers regard market base finance. the central bank ireland actively employ micro-level data ass understand sector. for example, use ass non-bank financial institutions’ engagement credit intermediation, liquidity mismatch leverage. we also monitor interconnectedness part financial system. and engage internationally ass understand trend development non-bank sector.market-based finance activity broadly define raise equity debt financial markets, rather bank system. it provide valuable alternative bank finance many business household support economic activity.developing alternative channel finance deep capital market one key objective capital

the cost insurance work group establish government 2016 examine factor contribute increase cost insurance identify measure reduce cost, take account requirement maintain financially stable insurance sector. where cases, anecdote use evidence, one group’s key recommendation policy discussion area insurance support independent reliable statistics. the central bank task job work address data gap motor insurance market establishment national claim information database (ncid).today’s report ncid increase transparency sector. the report assist cost insurance work group, government, oireachtas wide stakeholder consideration relevant issues.the motor insurance report range new information relation claims; premiums; comparison settlement channel breakdown insurers’ income expenditure private motor insurance (central bank, 2019)the overall trend consistent long term insurance underwrite cycle, peak trough premiums, reserve profitability. cycle typically last six nine years. the report rich data one key comparison undoubtedly draw attention. between 2009 2018, average cost claim per policy decrease 2.5% €437 2009 €426 2018. in contrast, 2009 2018, average premium per policy increase 42% €495 2009 €705 2018. now, i’m say black-and-white case. data cannot consider isolation – consider round contextual circumstances, underwrite cycle mention previously. for instance, correct say data average cost claim per policy fallen, also true say average cost claim steadily increase period.in all, average cost claim 64% per cent period. within compositional shift great proportion high value injury claims. the average cost injury claim increase steadily entire period 50% high decade ago, currently €47,000. look loss ratio insurance firms, prolong period loss peak 2014. this since come down. firm profitable, line peak trough cycle. like i said, task gather data publish it, others analyse contextualise pattern see above. but i say confidence first report play important role bring great level transparency market, provide data support evidence base decision-making. good data insurance claim inform policy debate government, oireachtas, firm wide society well inform work central bank. and come back started, household finance need data, i want finish think challenge network go forward. the hfc uniquely position answer question shape policy go forward. issue demographic affect

how change affect households, affect economy, policy? and course beyond data, also need push boundary analyse, model estimate. this include use behavioural economics, provide insight people actually make decision real world, factor affect decisions, gain new perspective diverse range topic mortgage switch differential price example. by constantly develop analytical approach gain great insight understand world around us. but detail another day. let u continue excellent research analysis see already. but must always lookout new area challenge resources, skill knowledge contribute – short,

lady gentleman it pleasure welcome swiss national bank’s news conference. a usual, i begin explain monetary policy decision present assessment economic situation. i also address three additional subjects: five year negative interest, possible consequence climate change snb fulfil mandate, study method behind company talks. after remarks, fritz zurbrügg report development area financial stability, andréa maechler talk situation financial markets. we – ever – please take question afterwards. monetary policy decision i begin monetary policy decision. we keep snb policy rate interest sight deposit snb −0.75%. we remain will intervene foreign exchange market necessary, take overall currency situation consideration. our expansionary monetary policy continue necessary give inflation outlook switzerland. the trade-weighted exchange rate swiss franc practically unchanged compare september 2019. the franc thus remain highly valued, situation foreign exchange market still fragile. negative interest willingness intervene counteract attractiveness swiss franc investment thus ease upward pressure currency. in way, snb stabilise price development support economic activity. the new conditional inflation forecast come quarter slightly low september. the longer-term forecast virtually unchanged. for 2019 forecast stand berne, 12 december 2019 thomas jordan news conference page 2/6 0.4%, 2020 0.1% 2021 0.5%. the conditional inflation forecast base assumption snb policy rate remain –0.75% entire forecast horizon. global economic outlook international trade tension political uncertainty weigh global economy recent months. accordingly, economic growth around world slightly average third quarter. the increase manufacture output modest many countries, accompany subdue capital spend lacklustre global trade goods. against backdrop, employment growth advance economy slow quarter ago, unemployment fell slightly. however, already low many countries, thus lend support consumer demand. various central bank ease monetary policy autumn light modest inflation economic risks. moreover, signal would probably leave policy rate low level extend period time. the snb maintain exist baseline scenario global economy, expect momentum remain modest short term. the monetary policy ease likely contribute economy – thus also inflation – pick medium term. risk global economy remain tilt downside. chief among still trade tension possibility persist weakness manufacture activity spread economy whole. swiss economic outlook accord initial estimate, swiss economy grow 1.6% third quarter. this growth primarily drive manufacturing, value add increase significantly thank strong growth export pharmaceutical products. the industry manufacture sector record modest expansion, line slowdown manufacture worldwide. the labour market continue mainstay economy. employment figure rise slightly, unemployment rate persist low level november. gdp likely expand around 1% 2019, snb expect growth 1.5% 2% 2020. the strong expansion next year reflect gradual firm expect global economic activity well exceptional effect. the latter stem fact forecast include revenue generate major international sport events, likely increase growth around half percentage point. monetary situation inflation expectation let move address monetary condition – say, exchange rate interest rate – well inflation expectations. berne, 12 december 2019 thomas jordan news conference page 3/6 the external value swiss franc remain stable since monetary policy assessment september. there also scarcely change trade-weighted exchange rate 2019 whole, although initially decline appreciate summer. the swiss franc thus remain highly valued, situation foreign exchange market still fragile. short-term interest rate close snb policy rate. the long-term swiss franc rate reach new low summer, recover slightly since. this pattern reflect global interest rate movements. the yield 10-year swiss confederation bond currently stand –0.5%, compare –0.2% begin year. the long-term interest rate euro area u decline even strongly. all all, low interest rate environment around world become entrench course 2019. finally, inflation expectation decline slightly switzerland comparison start year. however, remain within range 0% 2% snb equate price stability. five year negative interest lady gentlemen, snb introduce negative interest rate five year ago. hardly anyone think would still place end 2019. i would therefore like take opportunity set convince negative interest remain necessary today. a rule, switzerland low interest rate countries, one reason investor value security swiss franc investments. follow outbreak financial crisis, many central bank quickly low policy rate towards zero. this mean swiss money market rate practically level countries. amid prevail uncertainty time, demand swiss franc rise sharply. to counter extreme upward pressure, thus ward threat severe recession couple deflation, introduce minimum exchange rate 2011. this initially bring calm situation. owe international developments, become apparent begin 2015 minimum exchange rate long sustainable. to limit appreciation swiss franc discontinuation, set negative interest rate −0.75%. the impact negative interest prove considerable, help stabilise exchange rate situation short order. without it, franc would significantly strong recent years, would highly detrimental swiss economy would jeopardise price stability. and, lady gentlemen, negative interest remain central monetary policy day. if dispense it, swiss interest rate would increase compare countries, swiss franc investment would markedly attractive, would berne, 12 december 2019 thomas jordan news conference page 4/6 expect mark rapid appreciation currency. inflation would thus fall significantly negative territory, economy would slowed. but interest rate low first place? this part due expansionary monetary policy. however, main reason time save increase worldwide, comparatively little investment made. the high save rate largely attributable demographics. the dearth investment due, among things, low productivity gains. both factor heighten prevail uncertainty since onset financial crisis. if save le investment, interest rate economy equilibrium falls. switzerland cannot distance global development. central bank set policy rate relative equilibrium interest rate. to expansionary effect, policy rate must low equilibrium interest rate. and latter low, policy rate low zero. unusual though may be, lady gentlemen, negative interest rate nonetheless necessary current situation fulfil mandate backdrop low interest rate worldwide. at time, low interest rate give rise certain challenges. negative interest therefore also attract criticism. that said, convince benefit clearly hold sway. our assessment centre fact take overall view, seek serve interest country whole. from perspective saver pension funds, present situation low interest income is, course, difficult. you might think snb could simply remedy this. but let u assume raise snb policy rate zero current situation. the economy would cool dramatically, inflation would fall well negative territory, unemployment would rise. in environment, would scarcely increase longer-term interest rates. furthermore, would probably soon low policy rate give economic slowdown low inflation. hence gain income saver pension fund would sustainable. from banks’ perspective, negative interest rate payment snb cost factor. we aware burden represents. that september adjust calculation exemption threshold way payment make bank system nearly halved. we burden bank system necessary u able steer short-term money market rates. lady gentlemen, monitor impact negative interest precisely, take side-effects seriously. however, remain convince benefit bring switzerland whole clearly outweigh costs. the negative interest rate willingness intervene currently best instrument ensure appropriate monetary condition thus secure price stability support economy. berne, 12 december 2019 thomas jordan news conference page 5/6 monetary policy outlook allow summarise key message regard monetary policy. we anticipate economy expand around 1% year. we expect growth 1.5% 2% next year. inflation expectation within range consistent price stability. the conditional inflation forecast come quarter slightly low september, essentially unchanged long term. the swiss franc remain highly valued, situation foreign exchange market still fragile. against backdrop, expansionary monetary policy remain appropriate. monetary policy climate change this bring significance climate change snb. when come key issue, focus first foremost able properly ass possible consequence function economy financial systems, switzerland worldwide. broadly speaking, climate change affect monetary policy two ways. on one hand, lead structural change economy. this rather slow steady process must take account forecast model course time. on hand, regulatory climate protection measure lead sudden change price important goods. the snb analysis impact type change growth inflation, resultant consequence monetary policy. the dialogue within framework central banks’ supervisors’ network green financial system also help u respect. the snb actively involve ngf work group address monetary policy, financial stability investment policy aspects. we also regularly exchange information climate-related issue institutions. my two colleague talk climate change perspective financial stability investment policy afterwards. study method use snb’s company talk i would like talk additional document find press kits, namely study look method snb’s delegate use carry discussion companies. a know, delegate regional economic relation regularly conduct talk manager company throughout switzerland. these provide u timely, first-hand account late cyclical structural development swiss economy. a summary result time publish quarterly business cycle signal report. the enclose study explain objective method underlie company talks. you also find late issue business cycle signal press kits. both source information are, course, also available website. berne, 12 december 2019 thomas jordan news conference page 6/6 lady gentlemen, thank attention. it pleasure give floor fritz zurbrügg. news conference page 1/6 berne, 12 december 2019 andréa m. maechler introductory remark andréa m. maechler i would like begin review development global financial markets, pay special attention situation swiss franc money market. i also brief preparation replace libor progressing. after this, i address importance climate risk snb’s investment policy. i close remark snb’s involvement new innovation hub set bank international settlements. situation financial market economic concern political uncertainty shape development global financial foreign exchange market recent months. for instance, tug war us-china trade dispute weigh investors’ risk sentiment, especially third quarter. interest rate decline significantly around world phase. yield curve flatten markedly. in countries, long-term interest rate even drop level short-term rates. the yield ten-year confederation bond fell historic low −1.1% august (cf. chart 1). investor sentiment pick september backdrop monetary policy ease u federal reserve european central bank somewhat favourable economic data. the equity market benefit particular reduce trade tension october, major share index reach new high november. the swiss market index (smi) gain almost 5% since mid-year, recently surpass 2007 peak 12% (cf. chart 2). in environment, interest rate recover slightly low yield curve also steepen again. however, yield government bond issue country consider safe investor mostly mid-year level late; around 28% government debt berne, 12 december 2019 andréa m. maechler news conference page 2/6 worldwide still trade negative yields. in switzerland, yield 10-year confederation bond recently stand −0.5%, approximately level mid-2019. overall, uncertainty dominate financial market – fact also reflect foreign exchange market prices. weak economic data weigh particularly heavily euro, depreciate 2.5% trade-weighted term since end june. on hand, currency consider safe haven market able appreciate environment. the japanese yen swiss franc gain slightly since mid-year; franc thus remain highly valued. the situation foreign exchange market still fragile (cf. chart 3). money market development let turn development swiss franc money market. thomas jordan already mention adjustment make way calculate exemption threshold negative interest rate. these change come effect 1 november. since then, many bank benefit high exemption threshold incentive take liquidity via money market. a expected, demand liquidity lead high trade volume slight rise saron short-term repo rate week follow introduction new calculation basis (cf. chart 4). the snb active repo market time time order keep saron close snb policy rate. the swiss franc repo market function smoothly throughout transition, least thank state-of-the-art reliable money market infrastructure. the snb trade use infrastructure bank interbank market. this particularly helpful ensure snb’s operation highly effective. transition libor saron saron currently establish lead reference interest rate financial product swiss franc replace libor. a know, uk’s financial regulator support libor end 2021, important transition process market take place now. over last years, national work group swiss franc reference rate (nwg) put forward recommendation proceed replace libor. market participant must act decisively implement recommendations. a saron-based swap market especially important financial markets. swap market use hedge interest rate risk (e.g. mortgages); associate transaction produce swap curve, serf benchmark price value bond loans. to date, however, trade – hence liquidity – saron swap low. this change saron-based cash product become available. the successful transition away libor therefore hinge development products. berne, 12 december 2019 andréa m. maechler news conference page 3/6 in order saron use reference rate cash products, longer-term interest rate must calculate daily rate. a early 2018, nwg recommend various option calculate average interest rate base realise saron values. this approach, know compounding, also gain traction abroad. a wide range option calculate average rate propose evaluated. at late meeting, nwg specific narrow set recommend options.1 a result, market participant begin embed compound approach product mortgages. in addition new saron-based cash products, solution must find exist libor-based products. ideally, replace new, saron-based contracts. at least, exist contract must furnish fallback clauses, come effect libor long available reference rate. i stress evident swiss franc libor cease exist. the stage set transition saron, market participant use time end 2021 complete work remain done. a successful transition libor saron crucial smooth function swiss franc money capital markets. importance climate risk snb’s investment policy i would like say word importance climate risk snb’s investment policy. let start summarise policy. our asset management govern primacy monetary policy. in apply investment policy, snb two main objectives. the first ensure balance sheet use monetary policy purpose time. in particular, snb must position expand shrink balance sheet needed. the second objective preserve value currency reserve long term. a high degree asset liquidity diversification require ensure sufficient room manoeuvre implementation monetary policy. a snb pursue strategic structural objective investments, seek achieve broad possible market coverage manage assets. so climate risk mean snb’s investment policy? in context investment policy, climate risk fundamentally different financial risk – trigger amplify market fluctuations, influence attractiveness certain assets. by opt broad coverage entire markets, snb take account complexity many different risks. we regularly review change risk landscape factor investment policy necessary. furthermore, investor snb long place clear set

2019 it great pleasure here. the topic session among challenge central bank today. my contribution four parts. i shall start observation monetary policy financial spillover financially interconnect world, move consider role euro area, follow implication southern mediterranean countries. i shall conclude discuss policy implications. the debate monetary financial spillover financially interconnect

‘trilemma’, preserve monetary autonomy, open capital account require flexible exchange rates. in well-known paper present jackson hole 2013, hélène rey contest validity ‘trilemma’.2 she argue existence global financial cycle, essentially drive u monetary policy due dominance u dollar international monetary financial system, increasingly undermine usefulness flexible exchange rate insulate economy external shocks. on contrary, financial implication exchange rate change may well dominate real implications, exchange rate movement may even exacerbate spillover (i shall come back issue later). accord ‘dilemma’ view, way resort management capital flows, either explicit control mean macroprudential measure aim reduce boom bust cycle asset prices. the debate still much alive today; indeed, one key topic 2019 jackson hole economic symposium.3 the question domestic policy country fundamental still matter, use tame impact volatile capital flows. on one hand, empirical literature

economic area, euro zone immune international spillovers. the relative importance global versus local shock increase globalisation financial markets’ integration advances. u monetary policy, key driver global financial cycle, also influence euro-area finance conditions.at time, give euro second important currency international monetary system, ecb’s monetary policy potentially source spillover (fig. 2). in recent years, extraordinary monetary stimulus also provide unconventional monetary policy measures; international spillover sizeable.traditionally, monetary policy think cross-border effect mainly imply exchange-rate movements. recent experience, however, show monetary policy international transmission mechanism may several dimensions. the international environment much deeply integrated; portfolio substitution global asset manager act powerful additional mechanism transmit financial shock across monetary areas. moreover, policy rate close effective low bind eurosystem’s balance sheet greatly expanded, entire macro-financial environment transformed. accordingly, theoretical framework study international transmission ecb monetary policy stance enrich take account role increase global integration financial market distinctive trait non-standard measures. unconventional monetary policy significant effect abroad two relatively new channels. the first so-called portfolio rebalancing channel asset purchase programs, likely impact financial condition beyond currency area boundary extent domestic foreign long-term bond substitutes. the second channel – international bank lend channel – likely even important across mediterranean. the ecb’s accommodative monetary measures, especially aim make credit 6abundant, spur growth euro-denominated loan outside euro area, especially economy significant presence euro-area base banks.implications southern mediterranean country the issue quite important southern mediterranean countries. in fact, capital control still stringent many (fig. 3), region become increasingly integrate global financial markets. gross external finance need grow fast, exceptions, country lie emerge develop countries’ average (fig. 4).capital flow southern mediterranean country quite resilient overall since global financial crisis call ‘taper-tantrum’ episode 2013 (fig. 5), help finance ‘twin’ (current account fiscal) deficit country (tab. 1).however, volatile component capital inflow (portfolio bank flows) become large foreign direct investment (fdi). a sizeable share inflow go finance government sector’s large fiscal deficit (egypt, lebanon, jordan). at time, reduction fdi inflow region may also reflect weak fundamental (feeble growth prospect policy uncertainty, well geopolitical tensions). portfolio bank flow notoriously volatile fdi flows, sensitive global push factors, global risk aversion real interest rate core countries, expose recipient country sudden stops. a recent study conduct imf show portfolio inflow middle east north africa almost twice sensitive change global uncertainty countries.8 another worrisome feature concern currency composition debt flows. foreign currency debt expand rapidly many country past decade (tab. 2), make financial channel exchange rate especially important. for country sizeable net foreign currency liabilities, channel 8 imf, ‘regional economic outlook: middle east central asia’, october 2019. 7the opposite sign traditional trade channel may fully offset (i.e. devaluation contractionary). moreover, many country region trade integration primarily euro area (tab. 4) exchange rate mainly anchor u dollar (with exception tunisia; tab. 5). this create potential currency mismatches, especially export proceed mainly euro-denominated debt obligation u dollars. policy implicationsgiven interdependency across mediterranean country i describe ongoing integration euro area, natural ask: policy design order promote sustainable capital flow mediterranean area? the issue deal undesired spillover policy conduct euro area u remain controversial one. i would like use remainder time discus question three perspectives: country (or area) generate spillover effect (‘originating country’), country impact and, finally, multilateral approach.should central bank originate country internalise spillover monetary policy rest world? the textbook answer question central bank pursue domestically-focused mandates: thus, take account adverse effect volatile capital flow insofar negatively affect global financial stability, channel may generate spillback effect domestic economy. both conceptually empirically, measurement spillbacks challenge depend part policy response country affected. however, central bank limit adverse monetary policy spillovers, notably transparency clear communication monetary policy decision intentions. the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’ episode exemplify potentially destabilise effect policy communication mishaps. in addition, central bank contribute resilience soundness financial system monetary policy design support economic activity macroprudential policies, well capacity financial supervisor 8they responsibility. this, turn, contribute global financial stability, favourable spillover rest world.from perspective country affected, question shield economy financial system adverse spillovers? experience show strong domestic fundamental sound policy framework essential. this usually include sustainable budgetary positions; business environment capable stimulate investment attract fdi; policy framework ensure effective regulation supervision financial sector; monitor private public debt foreign currency. deep develop domestic financial market necessary condition build resilience external shocks. the consensus nowadays exchange rate flexibility might help, silver bullet. economy need good fundamental comprehensive set policy tools, include macroprudential capital management measures, protect adequately adverse spillovers.finally, multilateral perspective, seem interdependency policy originator destination country call enhance cooperation. while formal monetary policy coordination would feasible view central bank mandates, scope enhance multilateral effort deal adverse spillovers. have platform exchange view extremely valuable regard. i think high-level policy dialogue eurosystem mediterranean countries’ central banks. i believe right forum issue frame discuss regular basis.by share information view global domestic economic outlook framework within policy decision taken, central bank

sun, thus "the land sunrise."1 so couple thousand year back, people culture originate east collectively classify single category "asians" "asia." however, actual diversity ethnicity, religion culture across asia immense compare region world. for example, number asian sovereign state member unite nation 48, 10 different official language use multiple sovereign states. there also vast difference stage development asian states, large country term per caput gdp purchase power parity basis 7 time large small one region.2 while difficult generalize asia, expression "the asian century" use quite frequently. the phrase express asia's grow global presence, use similarly term "pacific" "chinese" century, also term "east asian miracle" "asia's rise." 1 etymonline.com., "asia – origin mean asia online etymology dictionary." retrieve november 24, 2019. 2 u.s. central intelligence agency, "the world factbook," 2018. 2 at time, term "asian century" evoke historical narrative shift center world power great britain 19th century unite state 20th century. back 1904, halford mackinder, english geographer, academic politician write "the geographical pivot history," forecast 20th century go asian century. his forecast turn incorrect. however, many envision 21st century asian century, give expansion asian economy growth population. kishore mahbubani, singaporean academic former diplomat argue last two century western domination world history actually anomaly history. in period a.d. 1 1820, two large economy world china india.3 more recent data economic presence asia show chart 1. ii. current state asia before i proceed, let briefly mention recent fact regard asia. asia lead global growth past several decades, 2018, account 40% global gdp.4 the region home around 60% world’s total population. the share intraregional trade increase account 58% total trade region's countries. financial interconnectedness also deepening. these characteristic show chart 2. regional policy cooperation take place various platforms. asean center regional economic integration south east asia, scope cooperation widen involvement country form asean+3 asean+6, even beyond asia arrangement apec. many asian country member g20 contribution global policy make increasing. in area central bank cooperation, regional forum emeap seacen enhance active exchange view share knowledge among members. the movement people across border become much active regional integration deepens. this also reflected, example, regionalization medium popular 3 schibotto, emanuele, gabriele giovannini, "singapore's role asian century – interview kishore mahbubani," asian century institute, february 12, 2015. 4 international monetary fund, "imf data mapper, world economic outlook october 2019 (gdp)." 3 culture. there long-established network production, distribution consumption chinese-language pop music, opera film within chinese community around asia. in 1990s, japanese television drama become staple audience across east asia. this success encourage korean television industry actively export drama regionally. these development result loosely integrate regional medium cultural industry east asia also help promote intra-asian tourism cultural exchange. iii. asia future with increase interconnectedness region grow economic presence, surprise expectation asia lead world. but simply extrapolate strong economic performance recent decade misleading. a well know, economic size alone enough accept global leader. look back history world war ii major power evolved, clearly show brute economic military power. a combination vision, moral value respect toward others also essential. what asia truly harness potential vast complex region, asia play active role global stage? asian country need work deepen intraregional collaboration base mutual recognition respect acknowledge diverse nature region. specifically, deepen economic regional interconnectedness certainly necessary. also, broad perspective increase joint engagement global community non-economic issue important. i would like touch upon separately. enhance regional integration if asia take global leadership role, would require promotion maintenance open flexible economy markets. the strengthen asian supply chain would also essential enhancement economic interconnectedness. much already achieve economic integration. for example, asean, progress eliminate tariffs, advance service liberalization, liberalize facilitate investment facilitate skilled labor mobility. however, show chart 3, compare europe, asia low participation rate global supply chains. promote trade 4 liberalization framework tpp11 rcep would way forward, especially environment global trade tension high. it important promote trade good also services. the region steadily transition mainly production area world big corporate consumer market world. this naturally increase demand service region well. equally important coordination cross-border regulatory institutional element within region. discussion asean's economic community blueprint 20255 could provide hint address cross-border issues. for example, business community past raise issue regard differ requirement regulation among asean country incomplete mutual recognition agreements, burdensome process inadequate transparency member countries. although substantial progress made, difference among member remain term ease business trade across borders. these challenge note asian country well. while eu aim economic integration establishment single market, asian countries, member asean, prefer preserve country's sovereignty. this certainly appropriate, reflect region's diversity. have say that, regional economy become dependent other, work necessary reduce barrier free trade good service direct investment. this would boost intraregional demand source growth. it also essential work jointly develop deep liquid financial market enhance effective use regional save invite long-term capital inflows. a basis strengthen economic ties, also important patiently strive deepen fundamental mutual understand among country people region. a i mention earlier, asian country highly diverse economic aspect income, industrial structure technological progress, also many field religion culture. for reason, important foster strong sense trust respect other's unique characteristics. 5 asean's economic community (aec) blueprint 2025 enlist concrete action take 2025 order realize aec envisage asean's community vision 2025. 5 engage global community asia must also actively engage global discussion beyond pure economic issues. for example, accord research consult firm compare soft power different countries, four country asia top 30,6 show chart 4. with around 60% global population, asia responsibility play constructive role global issue climate change inequality. through effective dialogue, idea value originate asia could provide positive impetus global debate. from perspective, important continue actively participate international discussion raise asian voice framework g20. a i mentioned, climate change area require asia's active contribution. address climate change risk require global effort. but, region would greatly affect increase natural disasters, rise sea levels, damage agricultural fishery industry, much urgent issue asia. at time, step economic growth, carbon dioxide emission asia increase rapidly, count half total global emission 2017.7 it important collaborate within region global community, example actively encourage introduction share environment-friendly technologies. how take advantage digital transformation another area asia could play lead role global discussion. many asian country include china, india japan key innovator manufacturer digital technology. if country region coordinate digital supply chains, synergy would significant. from another perspective, asian country face intractable demographic dilemmas. in much east asia, fertility drop replacement rates, population aging, workforce declining. labor-saving technology help mitigate demographic challenge improve productivity east asian countries. conclusion let conclude. the globalization lead development global economy 6 portland, "the soft power 30," 2019. 7 global carbon project, "global carbon budget 2018." 6 world war ii slow recently. country become inward oriented, change become major headwind cross-border financial economic activities. on hand, multilateral effort indispensable tackle many issue range trade climate change. asia one region benefit post-war financial economic globalization. in age uncertainty, search new "global order" continues. this bring challenge opportunity asian region, expectation region contribute global debate high. to end, important asia promote intraregional collaboration base mutual understand respect. strengthen bond within asia enable region contribute solve global issues. base many year work colleague asia, i confident asian century certainly come. thank kind attention. financial integration inclusive development: a view mediterranean country central banks, financial inclusion digitization: harness technology inclusive growth intervention mr. abdellatif jouahri governor bank al-maghrib madrid, december 13, 2019 2 governor banco de espana, president european institute mediterranean, deputy secretary general union mediterranean, dear friend colleague lady gentlemen, first all, i would like thank organizers, particularly governor bank spain, mr. pablo hernandez de cos, president executive committee iemed, mr. senén florensa, invite participate conference. take part mediterranean meet organize bank spain become, me, tradition preserved, since unite cooperation agreement. it also pleasure speak alongside panelists, colleague friends, topic particular interest u side mediterranean. inclusive development issue one key concern moroccan public authority several year now. with regard financial inclusion particular, engage u central bank, have, together ministry finance stakeholders, finalize start implement national financial inclusion strategy, whose preparation progress year now. thus, 2013, set moroccan foundation financial education, introduced, 2014 bank law, payment institution scope activity limit small-value transactions. a result, several stakeholder 3 take various disparate initiatives, prompt u federate develop national financial inclusion strategy. to end, proceed situation analysis base objective supply demand data, collect field surveys, mainly findex survey conduct world bank several countries. the paradoxical find emerge that, base indicator credit deposit-to-gdp ratio fsap assessment, morocco’s financial system prof deep compare internationally, suffer significant inequality term access. to give figures, share adult hold account estimate findex survey 34 percent national level. this proportion range 20 percent rural area 37 percent urban dwellers, 17 percent woman 41 percent men 16 percent young people 25 33 percent age 25 over. base data, become clear priority give target disadvantage group order reduce gaps. besides, fintech experience significant growth become promise lever, first measure undertake introduce mobile payment, consider high mobile phone penetration rate, reach 130 percent allow coverage almost whole population. to end, developed, together national telecommunication regulatory agency, national low-cost, secure, interoperable real-time mobile payment solution. this offer provide bank telecom operators, also payment institution form alternative network, begin license base strict specifications. 4 however, adherence retail merchants, necessary large-scale deployment solution, still low, many still operate informal sector. subsequently, prompt collaborate ministry finance order introduce tax incentive 2020 finance act. today, rather optimistic. these incentives, combine communication awareness-raising efforts, hopefully give new impetus solution contribute great integration formal economy reduce use cash. mobile payment undoubtedly one main lever financial inclusion morocco, certainly one. we also strive towards turn microfinance micro insurance channel inclusion. to end, applicable amend legal text finalize process approved. at time, continue strengthen expand financial education work, bring together national stakeholder around foundation draw international best practices. more particularly, work ilo afi develop educational packages, organize several instructor-training session various professional categories. in vein association cooperation, try bring together stakeholder reflect method implement bali fintech agenda. in regard, bank al-maghrib co-organized, last march, regional conference imf plan hold second one 2021. similarly, institution held, last november, africa blockchain summit, mean share experience african countries, stimulate innovation encourage startups. we hope take advantage latter’s innovation benefit benefit ecosystem. the select 5 startup indeed come promise solution strengthen financial inclusion. that said, digital revolution, know, opportunities, also risk challenges, namely term cybercrime, money launder terrorist financing, personal data protection, etc. this highlights, again, need appropriate regulation. in bank sector, we, central bank, strive agile appropriate regulation, offer support new actor ensure supervision. with respect fight money launder terrorist financing, recent mena-fatf assessment highlight shortcoming among financial inclusion non-bank actors. hence, compliance program set authority aim remedy situation medium term. a regard personal data protection, morocco ratify 108th convention council europe additional protocol. since then, set national control unit ensure proper observation various right (of information, access, rectification opposition). in respect, central bank play important role interface unit financial inclusion stakeholders. however, legal framework likely evolve view regulatory progress make area, particularly european union level. with regard cyber security risks, morocco move towards develop strategy security information systems, would base 6 risk identification provide specific legal, technical awareness-raising measure ensure protection, defense security. this project coordinate national defense administration central bank also act interface financial actors. all developments, particularly introduction new actor implementation national financial inclusion strategy, significant impact banks' profitability put traditional business model test. while bank may hamper complex architecture cumbersome organization, rapid unbundling bank service benefit non-banking fintechs could result substantial loss market share. under conditions, take advantage technological contributions, many bank embark strategy develop service diversify distribution channels. in respect, study carry bank al-maghrib 2019 reveal bank conclude contract technology start-ups form equity investment partnerships. however, stress problem specific morocco, global. ultimately, result healthy competition develop result improve quality services, fast transaction execution low costs, benefit consumer. to sum up, let say morocco enter new era field financial inclusion. attain objective set respect require effective organization regular monitoring. a such, bank al-maghrib set two new structures, dedicate financial inclusion digital 7 transformation, five-year roadmap take account need company regulator. i doubt issue financial inclusion challenge country represent here, specific level prioritization implementation methods. however, regardless context, success project require significant resources, financial, also primarily human ones. on southern side mediterranean, important effort undertake direction. however, i would like underline attractiveness exert advance country graduate specialize profile make task even complex, especially recent years. at bank al-maghrib, example, lose 20 computer engineer 18 months. i think point also deserve discuss debate meet one. thank you! makoto sakurai member policy board economic activity, prices, monetary policy japan speech meet business leader hyogo bank japannovember 27, 2019(english translation base japanese original) 1 i. economic activity home abroad a. recent development overseas economy let start development overseas economies. the global economy continue grow moderately, pace growth decelerate since start 2019. accord october 2019 world economic outlook release international monetary fund, global growth rate 2019 project 3.0 percent, low rate compare 3.8 percent 2017 3.6 percent 2018 (chart 1). the continue deceleration mainly due significant slowdown stagnation world trade volume cause intensify u.s.-china trade conflict. this exert downward pressure chinese economy, one hub global supply chains, effect spread across global economy, include japan. look development region, u.s. economy expand moderately, albeit somewhat slow pace. no significant problem observe u.s. economic fundamentals, solid consumption sustain amid historically low unemployment rate, increase house investment mainly due low interest rates. the european economy low growth, partly reflect effect economic slowdown china, one euro area's main trade partners, addition confusion unite kingdom's exit european union. emerge economy show mix movements, asian country -- economic tie china deep -- global trade issue affect production exert downward pressure growth economies. give ongoing u.s.-china trade conflict heighten geopolitical risk worldwide, unlikely uncertainty regard outlook global economy dispel soon. some region proceed policy action amid grow concern outlook global economy. for example, additional ease measure already implement unite state europe, economic stimulus measure take china. these policy action effective underpin economic activity certain extent; however, strong enough outweigh impact u.s.-china trade conflict, extensive prolong initially anticipated. 2 b. outlook overseas economy concern remain overseas economy may decelerate even due impact intensify prolong u.s.-china trade conflict. however, potential upside risk well. for example, economic measure implement far may show great influence first half 2020 initially anticipated, reorganization supply chain response trade conflict may accelerate. a i already mentioned, current slowdown global economic growth mainly induce significant slowdown world trade volume. moreover, mark contrast manufacture nonmanufacturing sectors: production export continue slow mainly manufacture sector, nonmanufacturing sector maintain moderate expansion. it seem resilience nonmanufacturing sector, account large share global economy, underpin global economic growth. c. recent development japan's economy next, i talk development japan's economy. japan's export production continue show weakness, mainly manufacture sector, affect slowdown overseas economies, particularly china (chart 2). on hand, domestic demand continue expand moderately. business fix investment continue see firm growth, mainly nonmanufacturing sector, private consumption increase moderately, employment income situation improving. moreover, public investment recently begin expand. development economy late 2018 show firm domestic demand continue offset relatively weak external demand, real gdp growth rate register positive growth four consecutive quarter (chart 3). the output gap also remain positive. give developments, assess virtuous cycle income spend continue operate. nonetheless, effect japan's economy development global economy october 2019 consumption tax hike need carefully examine time being. 3 i elaborate recent development japan's economy two aspects, demand side supply side. on demand side, little prospect rapid recovery exports, slowdown overseas economy expect continue time being. meanwhile, moderate increase domestic demand likely sustainable, private consumption, business fix investment, public investment sector resilient. look development demand component, private consumption continue increase moderately, albeit fluctuation mainly result weather conditions. this increase support solid employee income reflect increase labor force participation particularly woman senior (chart 4). a business fix investment, increase software investment aim save labor also investment intend domestic capacity expansion well research development (r&d) investment eye toward future growth (chart 5). this mainly reflect fact japan's gdp continue grow pace potential, albeit moderately, need meet rapidly increase inbound demand. look business fix investment detail industry, share nonmanufacturing sector reach around 70 percent recently. there possibility adverse impact japan's business fix investment slowdown overseas economy limited, underpin business fix investment relate resilient domestic demand. turn public investment, investment associate disaster-related restoration reconstruction well national resilience begin increase expect compensate peak-out demand construction relate 2020 tokyo olympic game (chart 6). next, i turn development supply side. it important business fix investment -- expand continuously -- positively affect demand also supply, term enhancement production capacity. particularly industry face labor shortages, active business fix investment aim improve labor productivity. this raise capital intensity, capital per worker. while active investment among industry act induce price rise raise potential growth rate, increase productivity seem act factor 4 constrain upward pressure price ease upward pressure wages. i come back point later. d. outlook japan's economy with regard outlook japan's economy go forward, economic development warrant cautious monitor next six month so, consumption tax hike conduct october expect impact short term -- although effect seem small previous hike april 2014 -- transition global economy moderate recovery path unlikely take place around mid-2020. under circumstances, pace japan's moderate economic growth may decelerate short term. at time, however, deceleration unlikely continue medium long term. this because, owe continuation monetary ease past seven years, significant improvement employment situation, prolong labor shortage encourage firm change behavior, virtuous economic cycle operate mean increase trend business fix investment. moreover, steady business fix investment nonmanufacturing sector, account large proportion investment, steady increase robustness japan's economy external shock, namely slowdown overseas economies. for time being, important carefully examine development global economy effect japan's economy. nevertheless, overly pessimistic outlook. give pace decline working-age population (those age 15-64) continue exceed total population time being, labor market condition likely remain tight. in situation, expansion business fix investment -- particularly intend address labor shortage -- firm private consumption highly likely sustain (chart 7). accord outlook economic activity price release bank japan october 2019, median policy board members' forecast real gdp growth rate 0.6 percent fiscal 2019, 0.7 percent fiscal 2020, 1.0 percent fiscal 2021 (chart 8). 5 ii. price a. recent price development their background next, i turn price developments. the year-on-year rate increase japan's consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food continue rise moderately within range 0.0-0.5 percent (chart 9). the year-on-year increase positive territory three years, affirm improve robustness economy possibility fall back deflation. however, yet reach situation inflation rate accelerate approach close 2 percent price stability target. gradual change japan's inflation mechanism recent year may account situation, economy long deflation see acceleration inflation. three factor japan's current inflation mechanism relevant context: one factor exert upward pressure prices, namely, continue positive output gap; two factor constrain inflation, specifically, persistent deflationary mindset public improvement labor productivity. first, output gap -- factor exert upward pressure price -- remain consistently positive since october-december quarter 2016. in fact, inflation rate output gap run parallel other, certain time lag. this correlation indicate positive output gap act factor place upward pressure prices. let turn two factor constrain inflation. a first factor -- namely, persistent deflationary mindset -- cost-saving mentality become deeply entrench among consumer due experience prolong deflation, influence cautious price-setting stance japanese firms. in formation inflation expectations, backward-looking expectation reflect past inflation rate -- is, adaptive formation mechanism -- prominent japan forward-looking expectation reflect future economic condition change policy measures. this account persistent deflationary mindset. 6 another factor constrain inflation relate improvement labor productivity, effect observe since around 2017. while labor market close full employment, upward pressure wage particularly increased. this partly due fact room restrain wage increase labor force participation rate rise parallel intensification labor shortages; moreover, worth note that, anticipation longstanding labor shortages, firm embark labor-saving investments, turn result improvement labor productivity. from viewpoint output gap, widen gap within positive territory avoid reduce labor input. improvement labor productivity prevent firm pass increase costs, personnel expense raw material costs, sale price (chart 10). in words, improvement labor productivity constrain inflation expansion business fix investment. b. outlook a inflation mechanism become complex, easy forecast outlook prices. first, positive inflation rate necessary overcome persistent deflationary mindset ground adaptive formation mechanism. assume output gap remain positive, key predict outlook remain factor -- namely, constrain effect inflation due improvement labor productivity. the rise labor productivity promote change economic structure take account consider outlook. that say, change supply side act factor constrain inflation also raise growth potential economy. with heighten uncertainty outlook global economy, immediate challenge japan's economy sustain positive output gap prevent halt change economic structure begin progress, maintain moderate growth support steady domestic demand. if immediate challenge meet appropriately, anticipate -- keep economy free deflation -- moderate acceleration inflation rate labor force participation rate eventually stop rise encourage real wage increase catch pace growth productivity. 7 risk outlook price also warrant vigilance. if slowdown overseas economy continue long anticipated, output gap revers back negative territory, japan's economy may face deflation again. a now, give positive output gap maintain back steady domestic demand, bank spare effort prepare circumstance additional policy action may necessary, carefully examine future economic development home abroad. in order maintain inflation momentum, important fully prepare global economy recover. iii. monetary policy a. current monetary ease policy it basic framework the basic framework bank's current monetary ease policy introduce september 2016 quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control. under framework, aim achieve price stability target yield curve control -- short- long-term interest rate control -- bank set short-term policy interest rate minus 0.1 percent target level 10-year japanese government bond (jgb) yield around 0 percent. it also purchase jgbs facilitate formation interest rate consistent yield curve control. subsequently, july 2018, bank introduce forward guidance, april 2019, decide set policy measures, include expand eligible collateral provision credit, enhance sustainability monetary ease policy. furthermore, recent monetary policy meet hold october 2019, bank revise forward guidance view clarify need continue examine momentum toward achieve price stability target. alongside implementation policy measures, bank continue large-scale monetary easing. in carry policy, i believe essential bank commit continue monetary ease examine matter broad perspective, include development financial market financial system well economic activity prices, carefully consider balance positive effect side effect continue monetary easing. 8 b. future conduct monetary policy the bank commit continue current powerful monetary easing. let raise follow point require particular attention future conduct monetary policy: (1) effect japan's economy slowdown global economy; (2) balance positive effect side effect continue monetary easing; (3) conduct monetary policy amid change economic structure inflation mechanism. the first point warrant considerable attention currently predict outlook japan's economic activity. if overseas economy slow negative effect japan's economic activity materialize, may become necessary take policy actions. in case, important action decide examine scale negative effect fast spread. for example, economy face crisis, could threaten financial system global financial crisis, lead rapid economic downturn credit contraction. therefore, decisive action would necessary. on hand, slowdown overseas economy stem trade issue remain moderate, speed spread japan's economy also moderate. thus, room take policy action carefully examine development economic indicators. the issue side effect another reason policymakers refrain take hasty policy action conduct future monetary policy. regard second point, namely balance positive effect side effect continue monetary easing, become increasingly necessary pay attention side effect financial system continue low interest rate policy. with limit demand fund among firms, financial institutions' lend margin narrow due mainly prolong low interest rate environment (chart 11). these institution increase amount risk-taking order acquire profits. however, due globally accommodative financial conditions, number borrower entity financial institution invest secure profit commensurate risk-taking 9 limited, possibility increase risk materialize financial institutions' capital adequacy ratio plunge event economic downturn. at moment, capital adequacy ratio type financial institution japan appear sufficient relative level regulatory requirements. nevertheless, ratio decline trend, mainly regional financial institutions, become necessary monitor closely continuation monetary easing. the bank examine risk financial system various means, financial system report, well on-site examination off-site monitoring, necessary, encourage financial institution address risks. it also open dialogue wide range relevant parties, include bank's center advance financial technology, help resolve challenge face financial institutions. a conduct monetary policy, important bank make policy decision appropriate manner carefully examine side effect policy measure financial system. lastly, third point, relationship monetary policy price long straightforward, seen, example, improvement labor productivity accompany labor-saving investment constrain inflation. a result, uncertainty context likely remain high. in follows, i would like provide somewhat detail explanation change economic structure appropriate monetary policy response changes. iv. structural change japan's economy role monetary policy i describe structural change japan's economy point recently come require attention. support policy mix monetary fiscal policy sustain past seven years, slow steady structural change economy. these largely divide change industrial structure accompany globalization, establishment virtuous cycle stem longstanding shortage labor. these result change japan, increase expectation rise economy's growth potential owe expansion supply capacity, increase 10 robustness economy change external environment. i touch point order, explain monetary policy conduct response structural changes. a. change industrial structure accompany globalization japanese manufacturer expand business overseas market since begin globalization trend last four decade follow collapse bretton wood system. consequently, share nonmanufacturing sector japan's gdp, measure overall domestic production, account 80 percent. japan's outward direct investment expand rapidly significant adjustment foreign exchange rate since latter half 1980s, lead establishment current global supply chains. reflect structural change manufacturers' shift production site overseas, contribution income generate outward direct investment outward portfolio investment, fruit firms' outward investment, tend increase japan's current account (chart 12). at present, japan's current account surplus account approximately 4 percent nominal gdp, consist mostly gain outward direct investment outward portfolio investment. japan's nominal gross national income (gni) -- measure nation's nominal gdp plus net income overseas source -- 4 percent large gdp, show japan's economic structure steadily change one manufacturer make profit production overseas. b. virtuous cycle economy amid longstanding shortage labor let turn structural change japan's economy. since around 2017, amid longstanding shortage labor, distinctive development continue observed, moderate growth economy, positive output gap, non-deflationary price rises, increase business fix investment. this suggest simultaneous progress interact development contribute sustain operation virtuous cycle japan's economy. 11 the positive output gap maintain labor shortage continue amid grow elderly population decline working-age population, couple expansion demand induce monetary fiscal policies. this seem raise corporate sector's expectation moderate expansion economy labor shortage likely continue medium long term. these raise expectation lead firm assessment would possible secure cost-effectiveness investments, include long-term investments, positive business environment would maintain certain extent. a result, fix investment expanded, particularly investment aim save labor. c. expectation rise potential growth rate accompany expansion supply capacity business fix investment one component make nation's gdp. in addition short-term demand, expand supply increase production capacity improve productivity medium long term. a supply capacity expand japan along structural change continuous expansion business fix investment, possibility moderate increase potential growth rate induce hereafter, time lag. look recent development potential growth rate, contribution labor input decreasing, capital stock total factor productivity (tfp) start bottom (chart 13). the expansion business fix investment, continue past three years, start induce supply-side structural change. together increase r&d investment eye toward promote innovation, potential growth rate rise future -- case natural rate interest also rise, cause real interest rate fall natural rate interest -- level policy rate great ease effect. d. increase robustness change external demand another structural change i point increase robustness economy change external demand. give establish global supply chains, japanese manufacturer divide production home abroad follows: (1) overseas site 12 produce local market export third countries, (2) japanese site produce japan's domestic market. this division likely result mitigate adverse effect slowdown external demand would japan's gdp decrease exports. give geopolitical background u.s.-china trade conflict, entirely possible, depend future developments, exist global supply chain may reorganized, particularly respect china. nonetheless, i expect reorganization greatly affect decision make japanese firm regard establish production site -- whether japan abroad, whether export local production. this division work among production site home abroad already establish certain extent, difficult imagine significant decline domestic business fix investment, even overseas production relocate different country. moreover, highly likely domestic business fix investment continue expand light structural changes, firm investment nonmanufacturing sector labor shortage expect continue medium long term. e. monetary policy support structural change japan's economy the fundamental role monetary policy achieve price stability, thereby realize maintain sound macroeconomic environment. the bank's monetary policy direct impact term alter japan's economic structure. however, large-scale monetary ease policy place almost seven years, many indicator suggest japan's economy improved, price long deflation. even since start year, solid domestic demand support continue moderate expansion, despite economy affect somewhat slowdown global economy cause intensify u.s.-china trade conflict. increase robustness change external demand help sustain japan's moderate economic growth, even face continue slowdown global economy. a favorable economic condition maintained, structural change economy bring increase robustness. in words, commit continue 13 large-scale monetary ease policy lead improvement economic activity, thereby indirectly support structural change economy. moreover, current monetary ease policy effective owe partly stability whole macroeconomic policy framework. the government bank clearly share basic understand policy mandate division role conduct monetary fiscal policy mix. while monetary policy aim directly stabilize economy, fiscal policy aim stimulate economy whole also implement structural policy channel budgetary allocations. it seem evident stabilization economy recent year smooth structural change occur attribute mix monetary fiscal policies, ground macroeconomic policy. furthermore, also important note global perspective japan's economy generally stable recent years. at present, large difference level price target among major advance countries, since start year monetary policy tend le accommodative. also, decade pass since global financial crisis, balance size central bank's balance sheet money supply major advance country quite stable (chart 14). in words, could see indication difference level quantitative ease major country declined. in addition, japan's economy continue long deflation, significant decline difference major countries' inflation rate -- affect long-term nominal exchange rate light purchase power parity (ppp) (chart 15). under circumstances, financial market may fluctuate short term reaction news reports, long run appear move within certain range. this suggest similarity global monetary policy major country constrain market fluctuations, thereby contribute -- together increase robustness economy change external demand -- stabilization japan's economy. 14 japan's accommodative monetary policy support structural change economy sustain policy mix fiscal policy, similarity global monetary policies. it also function anchor constrain fluctuation financial markets. among concern emerge light u.s.-china trade conflict, worry regard framework international cooperation, come considerable strain. the outlook global trade issue matter concern. nevertheless, japan's policy mix global accommodative financial condition maintained, i consider important policy issue japan sustain positive output gap support change economic structure begin appropriately address slowdown global economy wait patiently recovery. thank attention. economic activity, prices, monetary policy japannovember 27, 2019makoto sakuraimember policy boardbank japan── speech meet business leader hyogo── global economychart 1imf
