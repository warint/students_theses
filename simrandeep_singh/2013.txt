BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Haruhiko Kuroda: The Bank of Japan’s Semiannual Report on Currency and Monetary Control Statement by Mr Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, before the Committee on Financial Affairs, House of Representatives, Tokyo, 26 March 2013. *      *      * Introduction The Bank of Japan submits to the Diet its Semiannual Report on Currency and Monetary Control in June and December. Most recently, the Bank submitted the report for the first half of fiscal 2012 on December 7, 2012. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk about recent developments in Japan’s economy and present an overall review of the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy. I. Economic and financial developments in Japan First, I will explain economic and financial developments in Japan. Japan’s economy has remained relatively weak since summer 2012 mainly against the background of the deceleration in overseas economies, but some positive signs have recently been observed. The Bank currently assesses that the economy has stopped weakening. Three factors can be pointed out as underlying developments behind this change in the economic situation. First, overseas economies – the U.S. and Chinese economies in particular – have begun to show signs of emerging from their deceleration phase. The U.S. economy has been on a moderate recovery trend with increasing firmness, while the balance-sheet repair weighing on the economy has gradually been mitigated. Private consumption has been increasing moderately and housing investment has been showing clear signs of picking up, as the employment situation follows an improving trend. Business fixed investment, which had been constrained, shows signs of picking up. The Chinese economy, albeit with some fluctuations in exports, appears to be emerging from its deceleration phase supported by firm domestic demand, with firmness in private consumption and rises in infrastructure investment. Meanwhile, economic activity in Europe continues to recede slowly as business fixed investment and private consumption have been declining partly due to the effects of fiscal austerity and the tightening of financial conditions, although further deterioration in business and household sentiment is coming to a halt. Second, business and household sentiment has been improving mainly on the back of the recent depreciation of the yen and the rise in stock prices. In global financial markets, investors’ risk aversion remains abated, partly due to progress made in policy responses regarding the European debt problem since last summer and to the fact that the U.S. “fiscal cliff” at the beginning of this year was avoided. Nevertheless, developments including the situation surrounding the European debt problem – particularly discussions on the support package for Cyprus and developments in Italy following the general election – require continued attention. Third, factors that had been exerting downward pressure on the economy, such as the effects of the decline in car sales due to the ending of subsidies for purchasers of environmentally friendly cars and the effects of the recent bilateral relationship between Japan and China, have fallen off or diminished. Under these circumstances, exports appear to stop decreasing. Business fixed investment has shown some weakness on the whole, although resilience has been observed in nonmanufacturing. In contrast, public investment has continued to increase, and housing investment has generally been picking up. Private consumption has remained resilient, 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  supported mainly by demand from the elderly. Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has stopped decreasing. With regard to the outlook, the pick-up in Japan’s economy is expected to become more evident around mid-2013, mainly against the background that domestic demand remains firm partly owing to the steady implementation of various economic measures and that overseas economies gradually emerge from the deceleration phase. Financial conditions in Japan are accommodative. In terms of interest rates, the overnight call rate has remained at an extremely low level, and firms’ funding costs have been hovering at low levels. With regard to credit supply, firms have continued to see financial institutions’ lending attitudes as being on an improving trend. Issuing conditions for CP and corporate bonds have remained favorable on the whole. As for credit demand, firms have shown signs of increasing their demand mainly for working capital and funds related to mergers and acquisitions. In these circumstances, firms have retained their recovered financial positions on the whole. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is around 0 percent. For the next few months, it is expected to turn negative due to the reversal of the previous year’s movements in energy-related and durable consumer goods. Thereafter, however, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to start a moderate increasing trend as the aggregate supply and demand balance continues a moderate improving trend with Japan’s economy on a moderate recovery path. There remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning Japan’s economy, including the prospects for the European debt problem, the momentum toward recovery for the U.S. economy, the possibility of emerging and commodity-exporting economies making a smooth transition to the sustainable growth path, and the effects of the recent bilateral relationship between Japan and China. Recent developments in financial markets appear to assume that the global economy will emerge from the deceleration phase and pick up. The Bank will continue to carefully examine whether the uncertain factors surrounding the global economy will be dispelled smoothly. II. Conduct of monetary policy Next, I will explain the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy. Japan’s economy has suffered from deflation for nearly 15 years. This is an extraordinary situation even on a global scale. A vicious cycle – where a decline in prices causes wages and profits to contract, thereby reducing investment and consumption, consequently leading to a further decline in prices – has been causing a deterioration in Japan’s economy. Overcoming deflation at the earliest possible time is the most critical issue facing Japan’s economy. Ensuring price stability is the mandate of the central bank, and the role of the Bank in overcoming deflation is extremely important. The Bank has engaged in a wide range of efforts – from implementing the zero interest rate policy and the quantitative easing policy, to pursuing monetary easing consisting of comprehensive monetary easing, ensuring financial market stability, and providing support to strengthen the foundations for economic growth in more recent years – but fallen short of overcoming deflation. There are many factors – both at home and abroad – exerting downward pressure on prices in Japan: an increase in cheap imports from overseas, increased distribution efficiency mainly due to deregulation, and the consequent low-price strategies of firms as well as an increased preference among households for low prices. Notwithstanding these factors, it is the Bank’s mandate as the central bank to achieve price stability by addressing them. Indeed, no other country in the world is undergoing such a prolonged period of deflation. The government announced, for overcoming deflation and achieving economic revitalization, a “three-pronged strategy” – consisting of bold monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy, and a growth strategy that 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  encouraged private sector investment – and swiftly undertook responses including the emergency economic measures. An upturn in stock prices was recently observed, as a positive response to such efforts and in expectation of an economic recovery. Of particular significance is the joint statement released this January, in which the government and the Bank clearly set their respective tasks and announced their determination to accomplish those tasks with responsibility. This marks a significant step toward overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable economic growth. The Bank introduced a “price stability target” of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, and decided that under the price stability target it would pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time. The Bank believes that the achievement of this target, without delay, is its mission of utmost importance. So far the Bank – with a view to overcoming deflation – has been purchasing a variety of assets such as sovereign debt as well as corporate bonds, CP, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and real estate investment trusts (REITs). While such purchases go beyond the domain of traditional central bank operations, the scale and type of assets to be purchased have not been sufficient to materialize a strong commitment to achieving 2 percent inflation at the earliest possible time. We need to pursue bold monetary easing both in terms of quantity and quality. Moreover, given that there is little room for the interest rate to decline, it is imperative to work on market expectations in the conduct of monetary policy. Through communication with the market, we need to make clear that we have adopted the uncompromising stance that we will do whatever is necessary to overcome deflation. Furthermore, ensuring cooperation with the government is also important. The effect of monetary policy will be reinforced by maintaining consistency with the government’s economic policies. According to the joint statement released by the government and the Bank, they will strengthen their policy coordination and work together in order to overcome deflation early and achieve sustainable economic growth with price stability. The government will flexibly manage fiscal policy, formulate measures to strengthen the growth potential and competitiveness of Japan’s economy, and promote measures aimed at achieving fiscal consolidation in the medium to long term. For its part, the Bank will on its own responsibility pursue monetary easing with a view to achieving the price stability target at the earliest possible time. Parallel to monetary easing, if the government can take initiatives to create real demand and improve wages and employment through the expansion of consumption and investment, this is expected to contribute to generating a virtuous cycle that will eventually lead to price increases. To avoid an increase in interest rates on the back of declining confidence in fiscal management, it is also important to take measures aimed at achieving fiscal consolidation in the medium to long term. We expect the government to take appropriate actions in line with the joint statement. For the future conduct of monetary policy, we will continue to examine the most effective policy measures, at the Monetary Policy Meetings, by making full use of the Bank’s resources, while assessing the effect on the market through the examination of economic and price developments.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  William C Dudley: The economic outlook and the role of monetary policy Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Chairman of the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), at the Economic Club of New York, New York City, 25 March 2013. *      *      * Krishna Guha, Simon Potter, Jamie McAndrews, Lorie Logan, Kevin Stiroh, Paolo Pesenti, Richard Peach, Jonathan McCarthy and others on my staff helped with the preparation of these remarks. Clearly detailed accompanying charts to this speech can be found in the pdf document on the US Federal Reserve website. [For clarification, exhibits 8 and 14 have been revised to indicate that the charts show fiscal years]. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to the Economic Club of New York again. Today, I will focus on the economic outlook and the role of monetary policy. I will argue that the fundamentals underpinning the U.S. economy are improving and monetary policy is gaining additional traction. But this may not immediately lead to stronger growth because of the recent increase in fiscal restraint. As a result, I expect that labor market conditions will improve only slowly and that inflation will remain muted. Consequently, it will be appropriate for monetary policy to remain very accommodative. As always, my views are my own and may not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. Economic outlook: tug of war between improving fundamentals and fiscal restraint The U.S. economy remains on the slow growth track that has persisted since the recession ended in mid-2009. In fact, in 2012 real GDP grew just 1.6 percent, below the 2.2 percent rate of the preceding two years. This lackluster and disappointing performance masks the fact that the underlying conditions that support growth are gradually improving. However, in the near-term, this improvement in fundamentals is being offset by increased fiscal drag. Let’s first examine the fundamentals, which have improved in at least six ways. First, household deleveraging is now well advanced. Household debt has declined significantly relative to income (Exhibit 1). In the same vein, the household financial obligations ratio has fallen to levels last seen in the early 1980s (Exhibit 2).1  Second, the structural adjustment in housing has largely run its course. Activity and prices are firming, supported by low interest rates. Over the past four quarters, housing starts rose by 33 percent, existing home sales climbed by 12 percent (Exhibit 3), and home prices, as measured by the CoreLogic national home price index, were up over 7 percent (Exhibit 4). Although the pace of recovery varies regionally, the U.S. housing sector as a whole is now clearly rebounding. I see the recovery in home prices as particularly important. Houses are a significant component of household wealth. In addition, as home prices begin to rise we are likely to see more transactions and more building activity. Moreover, rising house prices are likely to encourage a further loosening of credit and appraisal standards that remain unduly tight. Third, the international economic outlook has improved somewhat. Global financial market strains relating to concerns about the euro-area have receded since last summer, though                                                 1 The household obligation ratio is the sum of payments on mortgage and nonmortgage debt, automobile lease payments, rental payments on tenant-occupied property, homeowners’ insurance, and property tax payments divided by disposable after-tax income. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  recent developments in Cyprus highlight the challenges that remain. Chinese growth appears to be climbing after a slowdown in 2012 and Japan is making renewed efforts to grow faster and exit from a long period of deflation. Fourth, U.S. corporate profits relative to national income are at an all-time record (Exhibit 5) and cash balances are very high. As uncertainty recedes and the outlook improves, I expect business will increasingly shift towards real investment from mainly buying back shares and hoarding cash. Fifth, the U.S. is in the middle of an energy revolution marked by a steady rise in oil and natural gas production (Exhibit 6). Just as significant, the sharp fall in natural gas prices in the U.S. has created a huge impetus to investment in energy-intensive manufacturing, such as in petrochemicals. Because the lead times on such investment are long, this impulse will likely persist for many years. Sixth, financial conditions have become increasingly accommodative, as monetary easing has passed through to a broad range of financial asset prices. Credit spreads have narrowed and the U.S. equity market has risen sharply (Exhibit 7). The price and availability of some types of consumer loans, notably auto loans, has also improved. So why isn’t the U.S. economy growing more quickly? The fact that fiscal policy has turned significantly more restrictive is the most important reason. The impulse from state and local governments that subtracted from growth earlier in the recovery has gone from negative to close to neutral. But this has been overwhelmed by the sharp shift in federal fiscal policy from mild restraint in 2012 to much greater restraint in 2013 (Exhibit 8). The increase in payroll tax rates, the rise in high income tax rates, the increase in taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act, and now the sequester – if sustained – will result in fiscal drag of about 1 3/4 percentage points of GDP in 2013.2  I view this as an unfortunate outcome. While the U.S. must put its public finances on a sustainable footing, this should be done in a manner that best achieves both our near-term and long-term objectives. In my opinion, a U.S. fiscal policy well-suited for the current set of circumstances would start with a very mild degree of restraint in the near-term that would credibly build to substantial consolidation over the next several decades. Of course, it is for Congress to judge what combination of tax increases and spending cuts should be undertaken to achieve this. Nevertheless, the aging of our population and simple math suggest that entitlement reform would need to be part of such a plan. Also, in an ideal world, fiscal policy would have broad-based bipartisan support. That would reduce uncertainty and reassure households and businesses that the U.S. was on a sustainable long-term path. Instead, we have nearly the opposite: significant retrenchment in the near-term, but no credible action over the long-term, with partisan divisions and significant uncertainty about what will happen next. Will the sequester, for example, be sustained or not? Economic outlook Looking at the outlook for 2013, I believe that growth in the first half will be sluggish as the fiscal contraction blunts the economy’s forward advance. While first quarter GDP growth will likely rebound to a 2 to 3 percent annualized rate following the dip in the fourth quarter, this will be due in large part to temporary factors.3                                                  2 Before taking into account fiscal multipliers. 3 This includes a modest boost from inventory investment following the substantial drag of the prior quarter, a recovery in farm output following last year’s drought, and less drag from defense outlays following the steep plunge of the fourth quarter. Rebuilding following the devastation from Superstorm Sandy may also provide some temporary lift this quarter. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  I’d also emphasize that there remains considerable uncertainty about the outlook. In particular, we can’t be confident about how much fiscal drag will blunt growth. Ultimately, though, the drag should abate. When that happens – presumably later this year, the economy should strengthen. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure deflator, is currently below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective (Exhibit 9). Substantial slack remains in labor and product markets, and underlying measures of inflation are subdued. With weak labor compensation growth, the trend growth of unit labor costs is less than 1 percent annualized, which is well below price inflation. Moreover, inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent longer-run objective. Thus, I conclude that the risk that inflation could significantly exceed our 2 percent objective is quite low over the next few years, even if the recovery were to strengthen considerably. U.S. monetary policy initiatives Beginning in September, the FOMC made a number of important changes to monetary policy in order to promote a stronger recovery in the context of price stability. First, the FOMC began purchasing an additional $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) each month.4 Second, the FOMC stated, for the first time, that it would continue buying assets and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until there was a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook5. Third, the FOMC stated its intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens. Two additional initiatives followed in December. First, consistent with the September statement, the FOMC began a new purchase program of $45 billion long-dated Treasuries per month. Second, the FOMC shifted to economic thresholds from calendar-based rate guidance. The FOMC committed to keep the federal funds rate at its current level of zero to 25 basis points at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent, projected inflation on a one to two year horizon is below 2.5 percent and inflation expectations stay well anchored. Both elements of the policy stance were reaffirmed at last week’s FOMC meeting. So why did we make these changes? The additional asset purchases provide further monetary stimulus. This is appropriate given that we were falling short of our objectives.6  Moving to an outcome-based purchase program also has other advantages. In particular, expectations of the ultimate amount of purchases should change as the economic outlook evolves. This acts as an automatic stabilizing mechanism. In particular, the FOMC’s statement that purchases will continue until the labor market outlook improves substantially provides additional support for the recovery by reducing downside tail risk. The shift to rate guidance based on economic thresholds was not intended to provide additional accommodation at the time it was implemented.7 But, the adoption of thresholds does support the recovery by changing the risk profile in a different way. The thresholds                                                 4 In addition to reinvestment of maturing MBS. 5 At the time the FOMC was purchasing an additional $45 billion a month of longer-dated Treasury securities while selling an equivalent amount of shorter-dated securities under the Maturity Extension Program. 6 While we specified a current monthly pace of purchases the degree of stimulus depends mainly on expectations for the ultimate size of purchases and how long we are expected to hold the assets that we have acquired. 7 This was made clear in the FOMC statement that the Committee expected to reach the unemployment rate threshold at the same time as the earlier date guidance. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  make it clear that short-term rates will not be raised at the first sign of economic improvement, before a sustainable recovery has been secured. As a result, households and businesses should be more confident in undertaking additional spending and investment today. The shift to thresholds-based rate guidance has other benefits. Relative to calendar-based guidance, it provides more information about the economic conditions the Fed would need to see before raising rates.8 Importantly, the shift to thresholds should also make the eventual normalization of monetary policy smoother, a subject I will return to later. But this raises an obvious question. If quantitative thresholds are good for interest rate guidance, why not also have such thresholds for the asset purchase program? There are two reasons. There is somewhat more uncertainty about the efficacy and costs associated with asset purchases than rate guidance and we are likely to learn more about the efficacy and costs as the program unfolds. So what is this likely to mean in practice? In my view, we should calibrate the total amount of purchases to that needed to deliver a substantial improvement in labor market conditions, by allowing the flow rate of purchases to respond to material changes in the labor market outlook. This makes sense because the benefits9 of additional accommodation will gradually diminish as we get closer to our full employment and price stability objectives and become more confident that we will reach them in a timely manner.10 At some point, I expect that I will see sufficient evidence of economic momentum to cause me to favor gradually dialing back the pace of asset purchases.11  Of course, any subsequent bad news could lead me to favor dialing them back up again. As the Chairman Bernanke said in his press conference last Wednesday “when we see that the…situation has changed in a meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation consistent with the outlook.” The labor market outlook So how are we doing relative to our objective of a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook? Since we provided additional stimulus in September there has been some improvement in labor market conditions. The unemployment rate is modestly lower and private non-farm payroll growth a bit higher than earlier in 2012, which is certainly welcome. However, other important indicators including the employment-to-population ratio and job-finding rates are essentially unchanged (Exhibit 10). This suggests that the labor market is far from healthy. Moreover, our policy is based on the outlook for the labor market, not the level of employment or unemployment today. In this context I note that the recent improvement in payroll employment growth, which gets much of the attention, is out-sized relative to the growth rate of economic activity that supports it. We have seen this movie before. When this happened in 2011 and 2012, employment growth subsequently slowed (see Exhibit 11).                                                 8 It avoids the ambiguity of what a change in the forward rate guidance would signal. Is the date being moved out, for example, because the FOMC wants to provide additional accommodation or is the move just due to deterioration in the economic forecast? 9 I draw a distinction here between efficacy and benefit. In my view, the benefit of additional accommodation would diminish as we get closer to our dual mandate objectives and become more confident in the forecast of a strengthening recovery, even if the assessment of the efficacy and cost of the tool were unchanged. 10 Of course, this expectation assumes no new information on efficacy and costs emerges that fundamentally changes my assessment of the merits of the program. 11 Assuming that the improvement in the outlook is not endogenous to the chosen policy setting to the extent that it would disappear if purchases were slowed. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Because growth this year will be constrained by fiscal consolidation, there is a risk that this could happen again. As a result, it is premature to conclude that we will soon see a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook. Efficacy of the asset purchase program exceeds the costs Our asset purchases are also conditional on our ongoing evaluation that the efficacy of the program exceeds the costs. That clearly has been the case to date – affirmed by our policy decisions. Since we put the outcome-based approach in place in September, my assessment is that efficacy has been as high or higher than I expected at the onset of the program, and costs the same or lower. Efficacy has two components: the effect of the purchases on financial conditions and the effect of financial conditions on the economy. Our latest purchase program has been associated with a substantial easing in financial conditions, higher equity prices, and narrower credit spreads. The resumption of additional agency MBS purchases in September pushed down MBS yields. With some lag, much of the drop in yields has been passed through to primary mortgage rates. Meanwhile, the impact of the improvement in financial conditions on the real economy has been somewhat stronger than I had expected. Since September we have seen considerable strength in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, including housing, autos and durable goods, in spite of the uncertainty and drag from fiscal policy. Improvement in these sectors suggests that monetary policy may be gaining additional traction. This is important because it suggests that the benefit from a given amount of asset purchases has increased. On the cost side, I conclude that costs specific to balance sheet expansion have turned out to be no greater than I had anticipated and, because we have less uncertainty about those costs, they are lower than I would have expected in a risk-adjusted sense. Let me start with three commonly cited potential costs – impairment of market functioning, the unanchoring of inflation expectations, and threats to financial stability. We carefully monitor financial markets for signs that market functioning has been impaired, looking at metrics such as trading volumes, bid-offer spreads, failures to deliver securities and our own ability to execute transactions. On some of these metrics, market functioning has actually improved in recent months. Of course, we will need to continue to monitor this, particularly if a rise in interest rates leads to less MBS issuance. But so far, so good. In terms of inflation expectations, a wide range of measures remain well anchored. For example, the 5-year, 5-year forward measure of inflation expectations calculated from Treasury TIPs versus nominal yields is well within the historical range of recent years (Exhibit 12). In contrast, assessing the potential costs in terms of financial stability is more difficult. Indeed, it is not clear to me which way the sign goes. Do asset purchases increase or reduce financial stability risks? On the one hand, information received since September suggests there is slightly greater reason for concern about potential excesses in certain corners of the financial markets. In particular, some areas of fixed income – notably high-yield bonds and leveraged loans – do seem somewhat frothy. However, I view the expected cost to society from bad outcomes here as relatively low. The broad and rapid credit creation associated with the most dangerous types of asset bubbles has been absent (Exhibit 13). The size of the asset classes in question is relatively modest and most of the investors in these assets are not highly leveraged. So if asset valuations were to adjust sharply and some investors experienced painful losses, I do not expect that such a shock would threaten financial stability. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Nevertheless, we will need to keep a close eye on financial asset prices. As I noted in my first speech to the Economic Club of New York 3 years ago: “Despite the fact that it is hard to discern bubbles, especially in their early stages, I conclude that uncertainty is not grounds for inaction. Instead, the decision whether to act depends on whether appropriate tools can be deployed to limit the size of a bubble and whether the benefits of acting and deploying such tools are likely to exceed the costs.”12  On the other hand, there is a financial stability case for doing more purchases in the current context. To the extent that risky behaviors and incipient asset price bubbles are fueled by an expectation that interest rates will be “low for long,” asset purchases that strengthen the economic recovery and bring forward the date of liftoff should promote financial stability. Also, to the extent that asset purchases increase the likelihood of a sustainable recovery, this reduces the financial stability risks associated with a Japanese-style outcome of chronic deflation. Although the costs specific to the asset purchase program appear well-contained, it is also true that the costs increase as the program gets larger. In part, this is due to fact that as the balance sheet increases in size, the risk of a period of low or zero remittances to Treasury also increases. As we acquire more longer-dated assets funded with reserves, the Fed takes on more interest rate risk. This is how the policy works. A byproduct is that our net income and remittances will be unusually elevated for a while, then are likely to fall substantially for a period, before returning to more normal levels. This is because our interest expense will increase substantially when we begin normalizing rates. Also, if we were to sell assets in a rising rate environment, we could also experience some capital losses on these sales. In combination, depending on the future trajectory of short and long rates, remittances could even fall to zero for a period.13  There are several important points to make here. First, the potential impact of the purchase program on future Fed remittances was known at the onset of the program – we have no new information here. The outcome depends on how the economy evolves, how we respond, and whether we decide to sell long-dated assets in the portfolio or not. Second, it is important not to put excessive weight on the possibility of a period of zero remittances. Our mandate is economic not fiscal – our job is to return the economy to full employment and price stability. Moreover, in considering the fiscal consequences of our actions, what matters is not what happens to our remittances – that is far too narrow a perspective – but how our actions affect the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over time. This is the metric we should be focusing on in assessing the potential fiscal consequences of our actions. In this respect, it is important to note that the narrow impact of Fed remittances on the federal debt-to-GDP ratio depends on the cumulative amount, not the timing of remittances. Cumulative remittances to date have been hundreds of billions of dollars higher, all else equal, compared to if the Federal Reserve had not expanded its balance sheet. And, according to Congressional Budget Office projections, even if remittances drop sharply in future years, cumulative remittances would still likely be higher compared to the counterfactual regime in which the Fed had not expanded its balance sheet (Exhibit 14). In addition, because Fed purchases put downward pressure on long-term interest rates, this                                                 12 Asset Bubbles and the Implications for Central Bank Policy, Economic Club of New York, April 7, 2010. 13 If the Fed’s net income fell below zero in a year it would record a deferred asset that it would redeem with future net income. Paid in capital and surplus would remain positive in a very wide range of scenarios. See The Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet and Earnings: A primer and projections , Seth B. Carpenter, Jane E. Ihrig, Elizabeth C. Klee, Daniel W. Quinn, and Alexander H. Boote, Finance and Economics Discussion Series, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2013-01.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  generates interest savings for the Treasury, and this benefit should be included in the fiscal cost calculations. Finally, and most importantly, to the extent that asset purchases are effective in pushing the trajectory of economic growth above what would otherwise have been the case, this will lead to higher federal government tax revenue and lower safety net spending outlays during the recovery period. This means that across a broad range of scenarios, our large-scale asset purchase program is likely to result in a lower federal debt-to-GDP ratio. To sum up, the better choice is for the Fed to pursue the policy that best achieves its mandated objectives and puts the U.S. government in a better fiscal position. This dominates a policy of fewer purchases simply so we can avoid potentially having to explain why our remittances may have fallen to zero for a short period. Issues associated with the normalization of monetary policy Finally, I’d like to talk about some of the other issues associated with the normalization of monetary policy. In general, I think it is premature to spend much time focusing on exit when we have not yet secured a sustainable economic recovery. That’s putting the cart before the horse in my opinion. That said, we nevertheless do need to understand the issues surrounding exit so that we can design the best monetary policy regime to achieve our objectives. On this topic, let me ease three concerns I hear frequently expressed. The first is that the large amount of excess reserves in the banking system will be “dry tinder” and fuel a rise in inflation. As I have mentioned repeatedly, the ability of the Federal Reserve to pay interest on excess reserves ensures that we can control the credit creation process and prevent an upsurge in inflation. The second is that when the Fed ultimately raises the rate it pays on excess reserves, it will be providing a subsidy to the banks. IOER is not a subsidy to the banks.14 In attracting deposits or other liabilities, competition among banks15 will ensure that higher interest payments to banks on their reserves will be passed through to bank liability holders. I look forward to the day when the economy is strong enough for us to raise the interest rate on excess reserves. When that happens, deposit rates will also rise. That will be important because ultra-low rates have been a burden for many seniors and others heavily reliant on this kind of income. When we raise the IOER, it will be my mother and my mother-in-law and others like them, not bankers, who will mainly benefit. The third concern is the notion that the Federal Reserve will be slow to tighten monetary policy because this will reduce the amount of our remittances to the Treasury. This does not add up. The Fed is a central bank, not an asset management company – our commitment is to our dual mandate economic objectives – not maximizing net income or remittances.                                                 14 When the Fed creates reserve balances, banks are forced to either add deposits or other liabilities to match the increase in their assets, or reduce other assets, by selling off securities, for example. In either of these responses, banks experience a cost of managing their reserves. 15 Among many other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act allowed banks to pay interest on corporate deposits, and those depositors, because they deposit large amounts, are likely more interest-sensitive, than individual depositors. Furthermore, the wholesale money market is intensely competitive, and, as evidence that reserves are distributed across banks in a way that reflects competitive considerations, note that currently, reserves are held in disproportionately large amounts by Foreign Banking Organizations. The reason I think this happens is that those FBOs do not have to pay the FDIC assessment fee on their liabilities (as they hold no U.S. deposits). That suggests that all banks face competition in attracting liabilities to match their reserve holdings, and that the FBOs, because they face a lower cost in doing so, have managed to attract those deposits at a faster clip than domestic banks. This is the sort of competition that I expect to see that will result in the interest on reserves being passed through by banks to their customers and to the broader economy. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Moreover, even if we were to put any weight on this consideration, the incentives go the other way – our enlarged balance sheet creates an additional reason to tighten monetary policy in a timely way. If the Fed were to delay in raising short-term rates to protect its current earnings, inflation would rise and this would push long-term rates higher. This would just necessitate a bigger rise in short-term interest rates and a greater loss of earnings later. A much more important issue with respect to policy normalization is moderating the risk of a sharp snapback in longer-term yields. But this has less to do with the size of the balance sheet specifically than the challenge of normalizing the current stance of monetary policy in all its dimensions. There is always a risk that market participants will foreshorten the Fed’s actions. Market participants could collapse an extended sequence of steps back to the date of the first move towards normalization resulting in an abrupt tightening of financial conditions. The move to economic thresholds-based guidance for the fed funds rate should help in this regard. While the thresholds are certainly not triggers, they should help market participants adjust expectations about the likely timing of liftoff in a relatively continuous manner and guard against these expectations being pulled further forward in time than is warranted by changes in the economic outlook. Nevertheless, we will need to communicate our broader intentions very clearly. Even when purchases cease, the enlarged balance sheet will provide substantial ongoing stimulus. It is important to recognize that the Fed could remain in this posture with policy “on hold” for a significant period. As the threshold framework should make clear, there is no fixed time-frame between completing purchases and raising short term rates. Long-term yields rose sharply in 1994 and 2004 when economic recoveries got underway in earnest after sustained periods of unusually low short-term rates. Compared to those episodes, the risk of a spike in long-dated yields this time around may be somewhat lower for two reasons. First, this risk is receiving much attention. Big market moves are typically associated with surprises. For the market to reprice suddenly, I presume there would need to be some new information that led investors to significantly revise their view of the outlook or the Fed's reaction function. Second, the Fed's expansion of its own balance sheet may be a stabilizing influence. For example, the rise in interest rates during the prior episodes was amplified by convexity-related hedging generated by the lengthening of expected mortgage duration. This should be a less powerful force this time around because the Fed holds a substantial portion of the agency MBS market. However, we should keep up our guard. The regulatory community must continue to take steps to mitigate the vulnerability of the economy to a sharp rise in long-term rates. This includes monitoring banks’ exposure to duration risk and the quality of their risk management and capital planning, while also looking outside of the banking system because some risks may reside elsewhere. In this regard, agency mortgage REITs and the risk of large outflows from bond mutual funds are issues that deserve ongoing attention. Conclusion The FOMC is committed to the dual objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. Currently we are falling well short of our employment objective and the restrictive stance of federal fiscal policy is a factor. On inflation, we are also falling short, but by a considerably smaller margin. As a consequence, we need to keep monetary policy very accommodative. I do not claim that there are no costs or risks associated with our unconventional monetary policy regime. But I see greater cost and risk in moving prematurely to a policy setting that might not prove sufficiently accommodative to ensure a sustainable, strengthening recovery.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Prasarn Trairatvorakul: Current topics of the economy and monetary policy of the Kingdom Speech by Dr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce Dinner Talk, Bangkok, 25 March 2013. *      *      * Good evening, Distinguished guests,  Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank the Japanese Chamber of Commerce (JCC) for inviting me to give a keynote speech at this special annual event. It is my honor to be back here again for the prominent institution that has its presence in Thailand over half a century, contributing to the development in trade and investment, as well as promoting Japan-Thailand friendship through cultural exchanges and technical support. For this special evening, I would like to reflect on recent developments in the global and Thai economy, and the challenges for monetary policy going forward. First of all, let’s look back to what happened last year. In 2012, Thailand faced a series of challenges from both domestic and external fronts. The global economy was subject to the main drag from the Euro debt crisis, while uncertainties remained on the recovery process of the US and Japan. These advanced countries faced a number of structural problems which would, of course, take time to resolve. However, it was encouraging to see the overall global economy continue on a gradual recovery path, with improving outlook particularly in the US and Japan, while China and Asia remained robust. The Chinese economy, in particular, was in a sweet spot with rebounding growth and low inflation, with room for further public investment. Asian economies also performed well mainly due to strong domestic demand. Last year, the Thai economy grew robustly at a higher-than-expected rate of 6.4 percent. Even though the impact of the still weak global demand became more apparent in the latter half of the year, spillovers beyond merchandise exports and export-oriented manufacturing production were limited. Factors supporting domestic economy include private reconstruction investment after the flood, while domestic consumption was supported by favorable wage and employment condition as well as government stimulus measures. Inflation in 2012 remained low at 3 percent, while core inflation averaged at 2.1 percent which was well within the Bank of Thailand’s target range. This year we expect growth momentum for the Thai economy to continue, amidst remaining uncertainties in the global economy. The US has managed to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, although uncertainties surrounding the sequestration process still remain. Structural reforms in the euro area continue slowly but on course. Japan also has an optimistic outlook, given a series of government stimulus measures to pull the country out of deflation. Improving outlook for the global economy should underpin a gradual recovery in export for Asian economies, including Thailand. We have forecasted the GDP growth this year at 4.9 percent. However, given a stronger than-expected GDP growth in 2012, this forecast is likely to be revised up for the next release in April. Inflation is expected to remain low, with headline inflation around 2.8 percent. The second round minimum wage increase is unlikely to have significant impact on inflationary pressure, given that many firms are able to make necessary adjustments in reducing costs and increase productivity by shifting to more capital-intensive production. Robust domestic demand should continue to be the major driver for Thai economy. Private consumption is backed by many supportive factors such as the first-car scheme from the previous year and cuts in personal income tax and accommodative monetary and fiscal 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  policies. Private investment is also expected to expand well, given the crowding-in effects of public infrastructure investment projects. Export sector should pick up pace towards the latter half of this year on the back of moderate recovery in the global economy. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges lying ahead for the Thai economy. The state of the global economy, while improving somewhat, remained fragile. And a firm recovery is still subject to risks and uncertainties. Domestically, although inflation seems to be benign, there is a possibility of rising inflation pressure from oil prices after global demand started to pick up gradually. Supply constraints, mainly from tight labor market, may also add on to wage-price inflation in the future. As a central bank, we always have to remain vigilant on price stability. Of more immediate concern; however, are potential threats to financial stability stemming from developments in asset prices as well as household indebtedness. Activities are increasingly active in the stock market and real estate market. We see more and more construction of condominium and residential houses in Bangkok, peripheral and major provinces around the country where prices of some of these projects have gone up rather fast. We also see household debt trending upward to over 70 percent of GDP. We will continue to be watchful and make sure that the situation does not get out of hand to threaten financial and economic stability. Ladies and Gentlemen, This leads us to the second part of my talk this evening. Given recent economic and financial development I have mentioned, it is clear that, as monetary policy maker, the Bank of Thailand is faced with a challenge to strike the right balance between economic growth and macro-economic stability. It is not easy to determine appropriate policy, thus policy decision has always been made with careful considerations, taking into account all economic and stability aspects. Last year, our main concern was about ensuring growth recovery from floods. Policy interest rate was cut twice with a view to providing an accommodative and conducive environment to growth. This helped accelerate recovery in the aftermath of the flood and support domestic demand in the face of global economic slowdown. At the same time, the Bank of Thailand had to make sure that core inflation remains within target and concurrently, ensure macroeconomic and financial stability. There has been continuous effort to enhance stability surveillance over the years. Last year, the joint meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee was first held with the purpose of sharing ideas from different perspectives. It set a stage for both committees to regularly monitor and exchange views on any systemic risk that might occur from the interconnectedness of economic and financial sectors and to form policy response, should further measures be necessary. For this year, the Bank of Thailand will continue to make sure that overall economic conditions stay safe and sound. Yet, balancing among different policy objectives to reach the ultimate goal of macroeconomic stability is even more challenging this year, given the possible risk on financial stability while the global environment is still surrounded with uncertainties. In closing, I would like to outline the key challenges faced by the Bank of Thailand this year: First, on monetary policy. Since the main goal of conducting monetary policy is to ensure sustainable economic growth, the MPC’s decision-making has always based on the risk to economic growth, inflation, as well as financial stability. This year, the challenge would be striking the right balance between economic growth and financial stability as inflationary pressure is well contained in the short run. Given buoyant domestic spending, keeping the policy interest rate too low for too long could give incentive to private sectors to borrow more. Furthermore, low interest rate will encourage depositors to switch to invest in riskier asset which could lead to the problem of asset price bubble in the future. Therefore, it is important for us to take care of financial system stability as well when we conduct 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  monetary policy. The Bank of Thailand has been closely monitoring the expansion of private sector’s loans and assessing ability of debt repayment of the private sectors, especially the middle and the low income groups. Second, on exchange rate policy, the main challenge is that the Thai baht has been on an appreciating trend due to various factors, including capital inflows surge into the region, structural change in the world economy, growth differential between advanced and emerging economies as well as accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies. Generally, allowing the exchange rate to be determined by the market can serve as an automatic stabilizer in the short-term and as an important price signal and catalyst for structural change in the long term. So, as the first line of defense, the exchange rate should be determined by market mechanism and from both the market and our own assessment, the Thai baht still remains broadly in line with economic fundamentals. However, the BOT stands ready to use policy instruments at our disposal to prevent and manage dysfunctional market conditions, excessive speculation or exchange rate overshooting. It should be noted also that, the baht appreciation at this juncture provides an opportunity for businesses to upgrade their technology and productivity. Given scarce labor and increasing wages, productions in Thailand need to shift from labor intensive to a more capital intensive industries and thus more import of capital goods and machinery are made cheaper during this investment up-cycle. Third, on capital flows management. In October 2012, the Bank of Thailand launched the Capital Account Liberalisation Master Plan. This Master Plan aims to facilitate Thai companies to diversify their investments abroad, especially in neighboring countries. This would encourage private companies to operate their businesses more efficiently by expanding their markets and production bases, which in turn will help strengthen their competitiveness. Facilitating outflows also helps capital flows to be more balanced. The Bank of Thailand, for instance, has removed the limit for Thai individuals’ outward direct investment, raised the limit per investor, and eased regulations for transfers of foreign currencies to facilitate investment in foreign securities. Recent surge of capital inflows to the region is likely to continue as long as advanced countries continue their extra-loose monetary policies and as long as the prospect of this region remains much more positive than advanced economies. There is no one-size-fits-all measure to deal with impact of short term capital inflows on the economy. The Bank of Thailand thus utilizes policy combinations, namely: allowing exchange rate adjustment as a first buffer; liberalising outward investments by residents; exercising exchange rate intervention to deal with excessive movements; and should circumstances deem necessary, the Bank of Thailand is prepared to consider appropriate measures in order to prevent serious impact on the economy. Last but not least, other than the monetary policy, there is still a concern over the structural problem of the Thai economy in the medium and the long term. Given the tight labor market and increasing wage costs, we need to improve the country’s infrastructure and productivity. This involves the upgrading of technology and innovation to move Thailand up the value chain. The well-being of workforce, as well as quality of education and training are also crucial to increase competitiveness ahead of the AEC integration. This cannot be done by only one party. Long-term coherent vision and concerted efforts among all agencies, both public and private, are needed. Ladies and Gentlemen, To close my remark this evening, I believe that the JCC will have a big role in shaping Thailand’s future and I hope that with the long history of partnership between Japan and Thailand, we will continue our close cooperations in all aspects in the years to come. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Agathe Côté: Toward a stronger financial market infrastructure for Canada – taking stock Remarks by Ms Agathe Côté, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Association for Financial Professionals of Canada (Montreal Chapter), Montreal, 26 March 2013. *      *      * Introduction It’s a pleasure to be here today. I am going to take advantage of this audience of financial professionals to talk about financial market infrastructure, a subject that affects every single person in one way or another – you, because of the nature of your work, more than others. Usually, when people talk about infrastructure, they think about roads and transportation systems. Montrealers, like everyone who lives in a big city, know only too well what happens when a city’s infrastructure system is weak or fails: delays, disruptions of all kinds, and various degrees of chaos. The nature of infrastructure is such that we only truly understand its importance when it fails us. The same goes for financial market infrastructure. Virtually all financial transactions are cleared, settled and recorded through financial market infrastructures (FMIs). FMIs allow consumers and firms to safely and efficiently purchase goods and services, make financial investments, and transfer funds. Given the critical role of FMIs, their risk management is of paramount importance; indeed, the subject of “systemic risk” was a hot topic in discussions about infrastructure long before the recent financial crisis. Over the past twenty years, there has been a steady stream of improvements, for example, developing payments systems and safely settling foreign exchange transactions across time zones. These improvements proved their worth during the crisis. Despite numerous institutional failures around the world and extreme levels of uncertainty and risk aversion, FMIs continued to perform their critical functions. The crisis also highlighted the importance of one type of FMI in particular – central counterparties (CCPs). A CCP acts as a buyer to every seller and a seller to every buyer for the financial transactions that it clears. An appropriately risk-controlled CCP improves the market’s resilience by reducing counterparty credit risk and, therefore, the potential for disruptions to be transmitted through the financial system. This helps essential markets to remain continuously open, even in times of severe stress. A CCP also provides enhanced netting efficiencies to its members, and helps to manage defaults in a controlled manner. For example, the Lehman Brothers default, one of the most memorable and dramatic of the recent crisis, would have been even worse if the London Clearing House, which is the CCP for a large portion of OTC interest rate derivatives, had not managed the default as well as it did. More generally, we saw that markets served by CCPs tended to be more resilient during the crisis than bilaterally settled markets. Given this track record, it is not surprising that market infrastructure, and CCPs in particular, have been key elements of the G-20’s efforts to strengthen financial stability. The Bank of Canada has a very strong interest in FMIs. Under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act, the Bank is responsible for the regulatory oversight of FMIs with a view to controlling systemic risk in Canada. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  But the Bank is just one part of the equation. Canada’s regulatory community and the industry are moving forward together to strengthen Canadian financial market infrastructure, and thus increase the resilience of the financial system. In the rest of my remarks, I will highlight some of the principal initiatives under way. Considerable progress has been made, but there is still work to be done. Greater participation in the Canadian CCP for fixed-income repos is essential I will start with an initiative that is close to home. Here in Montréal, the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC) launched a central counterparty service for the Canadian fixed-income repo market called the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service (or CDCS) in February 2012. This CCP has been under the oversight of the Bank of Canada since 30 April 2012.1  Repos represent a major source of wholesale funding for financial institutions and are critically important to the functioning and liquidity of other important related markets, such as the market for government bonds. CDCS was developed to facilitate a continuously open repo market, and to help prevent a repeat of the severe liquidity crunch that occurred in this market during the recent financial crisis.2  In the short time since it began operations, CDCS has expanded its product offerings, added participants and seen a steady increase in the average daily value cleared through the system. This is all to the good, but not enough. At present, just 10 to 15 per cent of repo transactions are cleared through CDCS – not nearly enough to ensure that the markets remain open in times of stress. While most of Canada’s major banks and securities broker-dealers are currently CDCS participants, the majority of Canadian repo trades involve at least one non-CDCS participant on one side of the transaction.3 Since CDCS cannot clear a trade unless both counterparties are participants, it will not be able to materially increase the proportion of the repo market that it serves without capturing a broader set of participants. Clearly, the challenge is getting more participants on board, but several issues must be addressed before some institutions can participate given the current CDCS model. For instance, smaller dealers may not be willing or able to meet daily operational demands or to actively participate in actions necessary to manage exposures in the event of a default. And large buy-side firms, in particular, pension funds, do not currently meet all the requirements for direct membership.4 Pension fund participation is especially important because these institutions are on one side of a large proportion of repo transactions. CDCC and its members are already working to find a way for both of these groups to participate. CDCC is considering how to set up a mechanism that would allow smaller firms to clear indirectly – that is, through a direct member that provides clearing services. This is a tried-and-true approach, one that is well understood by financial institutions.                                                 1 In addition to fixed-income and repo transactions, CDCS centrally clears options and futures traded on the MX and over-the-counter (OTC) equity options. 2 P. Chatterjee, L. Embree and P. Youngman, “Reducing Systemic Risk: Canada’s New Central Counterparty for the Fixed-Income Market,” Bank of Canada Financial System Review (June 2012): 43–49. 3 The current CDCS participants are: Bank of Montreal, CIBC World Markets Inc., Desjardins Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., Morgan Stanley Canada Limited, National Bank of Canada, NBCN Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Royal Bank of Canada, Scotia Capital Inc., and Toronto-Dominion Bank. 4 CDCS participants must be either a member in good standing of an exchange recognized in a Canadian province, or a bank to which the Bank Act (Canada) applies. Pension funds generally do not fall into either of these categories. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Current CDCS participants have a role to play in facilitating this initiative. They need to consider whether or not to provide clearing services to smaller institutions and, if they choose to do so, to develop the capacity to take on this business. They will also need to determine how to manage their exposure to their customers. For large pension funds, indirect membership may not be a viable option, given the concentration of risk that would result if these entities cleared through a single direct participant. CDCC and the industry are examining an approach that would allow these entities to directly participate in the CCP in such a way that risk is managed without requiring them to be subject to the same mutualized loss-sharing arrangements. It is important that efforts to determine the exact details of how this arrangement could work in practice be pursued. The Bank of Canada strongly supports the work currently being undertaken by CDCC and the Investment Industry Association of Canada to increase participation in the CCP. The Bank will continue to be involved to ensure that the solutions put in place meet our high standards for risk management. While there are costs to participate in CDCS, the benefits are substantial, and they are reaped in both normal times and in times of stress. Not only will the Canadian financial system benefit from more repos being centrally cleared, but both current and future participants will benefit from increased netting efficiencies and reduced counterparty credit risk. These benefits will be further enhanced as the industry develops a generalized collateral repo product, in which any security in a predetermined basket of instruments can serve as collateral. This product should increase the liquidity and efficiency of the Canadian repo market. The Central Clearing of OTC interest rate derivatives is increasing Let me now turn to another effort to strengthen financial stability through the use of CCPs. I’m sure you are all well aware of the G-20 leaders’ commitment that all standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives be cleared through CCPs. Canadian authorities, like those of most member countries of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), decided last autumn that we would allow our institutions to meet the G-20 commitment by using any CCP recognized by Canadian authorities, including global CCPs.5 While a CCP in Canada would provide the most straightforward oversight and capacity for Canadian authorities to intervene to mitigate risks, if needed, there are many advantages to the global solution. Global CCPs better promote liquidity and efficiency in what is largely a global OTC derivatives market. A global CCP makes the financial system more robust to shocks and allows derivatives users to appropriately manage their risk.6  The result though is that, globally, there will likely be a concentration of transactions in a small number of CCPs – these are truly becoming international systemically important financial institutions. To address this concentration of risk and to ensure that local authorities have the tools needed to protect local markets, the FSB developed safeguards for global clearing. These safeguards mean that global CCPs must: • provide fair and open access;                                                  5 This does not preclude the development and use of a local CCP in the future. 6 See the December Financial System Review for more details on the analysis: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/ wp-content/uploads/2012/12/fsr-1212-chande.pdf. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • be subject to effective co-operative oversight arrangements;  • have robust recovery and resolution plans; and  • have access to emergency liquidity in all relevant currencies.  Now, when it comes to OTC derivatives, the most systemically important market for Canada is the interest rate derivatives market; and the largest global CCP for this market is LCH. Clearnet’s SwapClear service, located in London. The Bank is satisfied with the progress being made to implement the safeguards for SwapClear and has joined a multilateral arrangement for oversight co-operation put in place on 14 December 2012 by the U.K. Financial Services Authority. To be clear, the safeguards have not yet been fully achieved, in particular the development of recovery and resolution regimes for CCPs. Going forward, authorities in Canada will monitor the implementation of the safeguards in any CCP that becomes important to the stability of Canadian OTC derivatives markets. Canadian institutions have steadily moved their interest rate derivatives transactions to SwapClear.7 We expect this trend to continue as Canadian banks satisfy the G-20’s commitment to central clearing. Indeed, the progress is such that the Bank of Canada now considers SwapClear to be systemically important, and it will become subject to Bank oversight as of 2 April. Designation, which the Minister of Finance agrees is in the public interest, gives the Bank the authority and responsibility to assure itself that SwapClear has appropriate and effective risk controls in place. The Bank believes that the combination of co-operative oversight of SwapClear and the tools that come with designation will provide the Bank with the ability to effectively control systemic risk within this critical market and thereby improve the resilience of the Canadian financial system. Holding financial market infrastructures to more stringent risk-management standards The last area of reform that I want to discuss today is the new risk-management standards for systemically important financial market infrastructures. In 2010, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) initiated a complete review of their risk-management standards. The goal was to make the standards consistent with current best practices and to reflect the experience of authorities in applying them, taking into account lessons learned from the financial crisis. The resulting Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures were finalized last year. The new standards are considerably more stringent than the previous ones and sharpen the focus on the control of systemic risk. They place a stronger emphasis on governance, and require FMIs to have comprehensive risk-management frameworks in place and to hold substantially more financial resources. The Bank of Canada has adopted these Principles and will apply them to the FMIs that it oversees.8  All FMIs – including those in Canada – will need to make improvements to their risk-management practices to meet the new standards. At the moment, each designated FMI is                                                 7 The Big Five Canadian banks are direct clearing members at SwapClear. 8 In addition to CDCS, the Bank oversees the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), Canada’s main electronic funds-transfer system; CDSX, Canada’s securities settlement system and central securities depository; and the Canadian-dollar leg of CLS Bank, which is a global payment system for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions, including those involving the Canadian dollar. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  undertaking a rigorous analysis of its practices against the new Principles, identifying gaps and developing plans to address them. The Bank and other Canadian regulators are working closely with FMIs to ensure timely compliance. What this means for participants, for you and your firms, is that there will be changes in the FMI’s risk-management practices as they move to meet the new standards. New risk-management practices will mean higher costs for FMIs which will have an impact on participants. In some cases, there will also be higher collateral requirements, but there will be greater assurance that transactions are carried out according to the wishes of participants, in good times and in bad. FMIs will inform their participants of upcoming changes as they work out the details. We are on our way, but we’re not there yet So where does this leave us? Emerging from the crisis, a key element of international reforms to strengthen the financial system was to reinforce FMIs. The goal is to reduce systemic risk and keep essential markets continuously open. In Canada, we have made much progress by creating a CCP for fixed-income repos and by substantially increasing the share of the OTC derivatives interest rate market that is centrally cleared. As well, we are putting in place new, more rigorous international standards for our FMIs. It is impressive how much has been accomplished, but there is more to be done. We recognize that many of the improvements involve costs, in both time and money, for the financial services sector. I do not want to understate the commitment this requires from all stakeholders. But the benefits will greatly outweigh the costs. And now is not the time to stop or slow down. It is essential to continue to invest in financial market infrastructure. With continued investments, we will have the assurance that FMIs will serve us well in the future.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ben S Bernanke: Monetary policy and the global economy Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Department of Economics and STICERD (Suntory and Toyota International Centres for Economics and Related Disciplines) Public Discussion in association with the Bank of England, London School of Economics, London, 25 March 2013. *      *      * I’m very pleased to participate in this conference honoring my good friend Mervyn King. As Mervyn noted in a recent speech in New York, we had adjoining offices at MIT as young academics and never imagined that 30 years later we still would be colleagues – as central bankers.1 Now, as then, I value his advice and insight.  The topic of this session is lessons learned from the financial crisis. For me, perhaps the central insight is that the recent crisis, despite its many exotic features, was in fact a classic financial panic – a systemwide run of “hot money” away from assets whose values suddenly became uncertain. In that respect, the crisis was akin to many other financial crises faced by governments and central banks – including that most venerable of central banks, the Bank of England – over the centuries. The response to the crisis likewise followed the classic prescriptions of liquidity provision, liability guarantees, asset evaluation and disposition, and recapitalization where necessary. Although the crisis had classic features, to a significant extent it took place in a novel institutional context, making diagnosis and response more challenging: For example, in the United States, collateralized wholesale funding rather than conventional bank deposits constituted the hot money, and run pressure was experienced not only by banks but by diverse other institutions, such as structured investment vehicles. In addition, the scale and complexity of globalized financial institutions and markets made it difficult to predict how the crisis might spread or to coordinate the response. One of the few positive aspects of this episode was the extraordinary degree of international cooperation achieved among policymakers, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, in responding to the crisis.  Because I have developed these themes in some detail elsewhere, I thought today I would tackle a different and more recent issue that has arisen in the aftermath of the crisis – the issue of whether, in the widespread easing of monetary policies, we are seeing a competitive depreciation of exchange rates.2 Like other aspects of the crisis, the notion of competitive depreciation has strong classical antecedents, particularly in relation to the global Great Depression of the 1930s. So let me start by briefly revisiting the older discussion and its evolution.  As my audience knows, on the eve of the Great Depression the exchange rates of most industrial countries were determined by the rules of the international gold standard – or, more technically, by the gold-exchange standard, as foreign exchange (primarily dollars and pounds sterling) was used along with gold as a form of international reserves. The gold standard, which had been suspended during World War I, was painstakingly rebuilt in the 1920s. Unfortunately, the reconstructed gold standard had a number of serious problems.                                                 1  See Mervyn A. King (2012), “Talk to the Economic Club of New York,” speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, December 10, http://econclubny.com/events/Transcript_MervynKing2012.pdf. 2  See, for example, Ben S. Bernanke (2009), “Reflections on a Year of Crisis,” speech delivered at “Financial Stability and Macroeconomic Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 20-22; and Ben S. Bernanke (2012), “Some Reflections on the Crisis and the Policy Response,” speech delivered at “Rethinking Finance: Perspectives on the Crisis,” a conference sponsored by the Russell Sage Foundation and The Century Foundation, New York, April 13. See also Ben S. Bernanke (2010), “Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisis,” statement before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, September 2. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  For one, the exchange rates implied by the gold valuations that countries chose for their currencies following World War I were in some cases far from the levels consistent with balanced flows in trade and payments. Notably, as John Maynard Keynes pointed out in his famous pamphlet, The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill, the British pound was overvalued under the new gold standard, which disadvantaged British exports and contributed to weak economic conditions in the United Kingdom in the late 1920s.3 One of Mervyn King’s predecessors as governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, who presided over both Britain’s return to the gold standard and its subsequent exit, said of the ill-fated choice of parity for the pound: “Only God could tell whether it [the value in gold chosen for the pound sterling] was or was not the correct figure”; another commentator added, “But of course the Deity may not be an Economist.”4  Another problem, which became clear as the global economy weakened and financial conditions deteriorated, was that fixed exchange rates under the gold standard were vulnerable to speculative runs. Although runs, or in some cases policy decisions, effectively took a number of countries off the gold standard in the early 1930s, the financial world was shaken to its foundation when the United Kingdom, the unofficial center of the global gold standard, was forced by a speculative attack to leave gold in September 1931. Over the next five years, essentially all of the world’s industrial nations left the gold standard, either de facto or de jure. Declines in the value of the departing nation’s currency, sometimes very sharp ones, typically followed.  The uncoordinated abandonment of the gold standard in the early 1930s gave rise to the idea of “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies. According to this analysis, as put forth by important contemporary economists like Joan Robinson, exchange rate depreciations helped the economy whose currency had weakened by making the country more competitive internationally.5 Indeed, the decline in the value of the pound after 1931 was associated with a relatively early recovery from the Depression by the United Kingdom, in part because of some rebound in exports. However, according to this view, the gains to the depreciating country were equaled or exceeded by the losses to its trading partners, which became less internationally competitive – hence, “beggar thy neighbor.” Over time, so-called competitive depreciations became associated in the minds of historians with the tariff wars that followed the passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff in the United States. Both types of policies were decried – and in some textbooks, still are – as having prolonged the Depression by disrupting trade patterns while leading to an ultimately fruitless and destructive battle over shrinking international markets.  Economists still agree that Smoot-Hawley and the ensuing tariff wars were highly counterproductive and contributed to the depth and length of the global Depression. However, modern research on the Depression, beginning with the seminal 1985 paper by Barry Eichengreen and Jeffrey Sachs, has changed our view of the effects of the abandonment of the gold standard.6 Although it is true that leaving the gold standard and the resulting currency depreciation conferred a temporary competitive advantage in some cases, modern research shows that the primary benefit of leaving gold was that it freed countries to use appropriately expansionary monetary policies. By 1935 or 1936, when essentially all major countries had left the gold standard and exchange rates were market-determined, the                                                 3  See John Maynard Keynes (1925), The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill (London: Hogarth Press). 4  As quoted in C.A.E.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  net trade effects of the changes in currency values were certainly small. Yet the global economy as a whole was much stronger than it had been in 1931. The reason was that, in shedding the strait jacket of the gold standard, each country became free to use monetary policy in a way that was more commensurate with achieving full employment at home. Moreover, and critically, countries also benefited from stronger growth in trading partners that purchased their exports. In sharp contrast to the tariff wars, monetary reflation in the 1930s was a positive-sum exercise, whose benefits came mainly from higher domestic demand in all countries, not from trade diversion arising from changes in exchange rates.  The lessons for the present are clear. Today most advanced industrial economies remain, to varying extents, in the grip of slow recoveries from the Great Recession. With inflation generally contained, central banks in these countries are providing accommodative monetary policies to support growth. Do these policies constitute competitive devaluations? To the contrary, because monetary policy is accommodative in the great majority of advanced industrial economies, one would not expect large and persistent changes in the configuration of exchange rates among these countries. The benefits of monetary accommodation in the advanced economies are not created in any significant way by changes in exchange rates; they come instead from the support for domestic aggregate demand in each country or region. Moreover, because stronger growth in each economy confers beneficial spillovers to trading partners, these policies are not “beggar-thy-neighbor” but rather are positive-sum, “enrich-thy-neighbor” actions.  Again, the distinction between monetary policies aimed at domestic objectives and trade-diverting exchange rate devaluations or other protectionist measures is critical. The former can be mutually beneficial, the latter are not. Indeed, it was this view that prompted the Group of Seven central bankers and finance ministers to issue a statement in February agreeing to refrain from actions focused on achieving competitive advantage by weakening their currencies and reaffirming that fiscal and monetary policies would remain oriented toward meeting domestic objectives using domestic instruments.7  Among the advanced economies, the mutual benefits of monetary easing are clear. The case of emerging market economies is more complicated. To a first approximation, industrial countries are most concerned that domestic aggregate demand be set at the level that best fosters price stability and a return to full employment at home. In contrast, many emerging market economies may be concerned not only with the level of domestic demand (as needed to achieve objectives for employment and inflation) but with other considerations as well. First, because in recent decades many of these countries have pursued an export-led strategy for industrialization, they may be leery of expansionary policies in the advanced economies that, all else being equal, tend to cause the currencies of emerging market economies to appreciate, restraining their exports. Second, because many emerging market economies have financial sectors that are small or less developed by global standards but open to foreign investors, they may perceive themselves to be vulnerable to asset bubbles and financial imbalances caused by heavy and volatile capital inflows, including those arising from low interest rates in the advanced economies.  I agree these challenges are significant. However, a few points should be made. Regarding the effects of monetary easing on exchange rates and exports, I would note that trade-weighted real exchange rates of emerging market economies, with some exceptions, have not changed much from their values shortly before the intensification of the financial crisis in late 2008. Moreover, even if the expansionary policies of the advanced economies were to lead to significant currency appreciation in emerging markets, the resulting drag on their competitiveness would have to be balanced against the positive effects of stronger                                                 7  For the full text of the Group of Seven statement, see Bank of England (2013), “G7 Statement,” press release, February 12, www.forexmg-pt.com/2013/02/12/bank-of-england-publications-news-releases-news-release-g7-statement.

Simulations of the Federal Reserve Board’s econometric models of the global economy suggest that the effects are roughly offsetting, so that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies do not appear, on net, to have adverse consequences for output and exports in the emerging market economies.8 A return to solid growth among the advanced economies is ultimately in the interest of advanced and emerging market economies alike.  Regarding capital flows: It is true that interest rate differentials associated with differences in national monetary policies can promote cross-border capital flows as investors seek higher returns. But my reading of recent research makes me skeptical that these policy differences are the dominant force behind capital flows to emerging market economies; differences in growth prospects across countries and swings in investor risk sentiment seem to have played a larger role.9 Moreover, the fact that some emerging market economies have policies that depress the values of their currencies may create an expectation of future appreciation that in and of itself induces speculative inflows.  Of course, heavy capital inflows and their volatility pose challenges to emerging market policymakers, whatever their source. Policymakers do have some tools to address these concerns. In recent years, emerging market nations have implemented macroprudential measures aimed at strengthening their financial systems and reducing overheating in specific sectors, such as property markets. Policymakers have also experimented with various forms of capital controls. Such controls raise concerns about effectiveness, cost of implementation, and possible microeconomic distortions. Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund has suggested that, in carefully circumscribed circumstances, capital controls may be a useful tool.10  In sum, the advanced industrial economies are currently pursuing appropriately expansionary policies to help support recovery and price stability in their own countries. As the modern literature on the Great Depression demonstrates, these policies confer net benefits on the world economy as a whole and should not be confused with zero- or negative-sum policies of trade diversion. In fact, the simultaneous use by several countries of accommodative policy can be mutually reinforcing to the benefit of all.  Let me end these remarks as I began, by paying tribute to Mervyn King. He has been a leader in the central banking community during an extraordinarily difficult period. I wish him the very best in the next stage of his career.                                                   8  Other work also supports the finding of no adverse spillovers. For example, one that finds strong positive spillovers is Bennett T. McCallum (2003), “Japanese Monetary Policy, 1991-2001 (PDF),” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Economic Quarterly, vol. 89 (Winter), pp. 1–31. 9  For example, Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub find that factors other than U.S. monetary policy have been substantially more important as drivers of capital flows to emerging market economies; see Marcel Fratzscher, Marco Lo Duca, and Roland Straub (2012), “A Global Monetary Tsunami? On the Spillovers of US Quantitative Easing (PDF),” Centre for Economic Policy and Research, Discussion Paper Number 9195 (London: CEPR, October). See also Atish R. Ghosh, Jun Kim, Mahvash S. Qureshi, and Juan Zalduendo (2012), “Surges (PDF),” IMF Working Paper WP/12/22 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, January); and International Monetary Fund; Strategy, Policy, and Review Department (2011), “Recent Experiences in Managing Capital Inflow – Cross-Cutting Themes and Possible Policy Framework (PDF),” paper (Washington: IMF, February). 10  Importantly, such circumstances exclude the use of capital controls to avoid other necessary macroeconomic policy adjustments, such as greater exchange rate flexibility. See, for example, International Monetary Fund (2012), “The Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows: An Institutional View,” (Washington: International Monetary Fund). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Fritz Zurbrügg: The financial crisis in its sixth year – an end in sight? Speech by Mr Fritz Zurbrügg, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Money Market Event, Zurich, 21 March 2013. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (http://www.snb.ch/en) *      *      * In this, the sixth year of the financial crisis, the situation on the financial markets has eased considerably. Is what we're seeing the prospect of an end to the crisis, or is this just a flash in the pan? Measures by central banks made a major contribution to stabilising the financial sector. This sector, however, is just a part of the whole, and while its stability is a precondition for sustained global economic growth, it is by no means a guarantee. The positive mood in the financial markets and leading economic indicators raise hopes that a recovery is underway. If these hopes are to be realised, however, structural reforms need to be implemented. The three most significant challenges for the global economy are increasing the resilience of the financial sector, improving the flexibility of labour and goods markets (especially in Europe), and consolidating the public finances of the advanced economies. Progress has been made in all three areas. The way ahead, however, is still both long and difficult. Due to the relatively lengthy period of weak growth, there is considerable danger that reform fatigue might spread in those countries most severely affected. It is therefore that much more important that the reforms are well-planned and credible, and that they are implemented consistently, but also prudently. There is also the threat that pressure will build on central banks to compensate a failure to reform with monetary policy measures. Central banks can and must resist this pressure, in order that they can continue to focus on ensuring price stability. Governments, on the other hand, should embrace this deep crisis as an opportunity to implement urgently needed structural reforms. Only then will we be able to say, with certainty, that the end of the financial crisis is in sight. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Malcolm Edey: The financial system in the post-crisis environment Remarks by Mr Malcolm Edey, Assistant Governor (Financial System) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian Centre for Financial Studies (ACFS) and Financial Services Institute of Australasia (Finsia) Leadership Luncheon Series, Melbourne, 22 March 2013. *      *      * I want to talk today about how the financial system has changed in the post-crisis environment. In order to think about that, it is useful first to look back at the enormous changes that took place in the roughly quarter-century period between financial deregulation and the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC). Then I want to ask how far those earlier trends might be expected to reassert themselves as conditions normalise. Perhaps the most obvious aspect of that earlier period of change was in the financial sector’s relative size. To give a few summary measures: • The ratio of credit to GDP increased from around 50 per cent in the mid-1980s to around 160 per cent in 2007. • Over the same period, the total assets of the banking system rose from around 50 to around 200 per cent of GDP (Graph 1). • Measures of financial market turnover increased dramatically on a range of fronts. To give just one example, foreign exchange turnover increased by a factor of more than 30 in nominal dollar terms over that quarter-century, when the nominal economy itself expanded only by a factor of 4½. Graph 1    
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The system also changed profoundly in other ways than just size. One was in its degree of openness to competition and in the nature of that competition. The post-Campbell reforms allowed market forces to work, and opened up the system to new competitors. The Wallis reforms followed that up by placing the regulation of banks and non-bank intermediaries on a more equal footing. We can see the consequences of these forces in the cost and availability of financial services to end users. Deregulation ended the artificial rationing of bank loans, making credit much more widely available. Another consequence that we are apt to forget is that the cost of financial intermediation came down very substantially. In the late 1980s the average net interest margin of the major banks was more than 5 percentage points. By the middle of the last decade it had fallen to a level less than half that – where, broadly speaking, it still is today. So finance became both cheaper and more widely available (Graph 2). Graph 2  These forces also had the effect of changing the focal point of competition. The rationing that existed in the old regulated environment had encouraged banks to compete on a “whole of institution” basis, rather than at the level of individual product lines. In effect, banks offered a package of loan, deposit and payment services and competed for customers at the level of the package as a whole. In this situation, wide interest margins were used to cross-subsidise payment services, and customer mobility was limited because loyalty to a bank was one of the critical factors in obtaining access to scarce loans. Deregulation changed that model by allowing innovators to compete separately for the most profitable lines of business. Cross-subsidies in the banking system were competed down, and this helped to drive the reduction in net interest margins. It is interesting to note that for much of the pre-crisis period, competition among financial intermediaries was focused mainly on the lending side of the business. In effect, intermediaries could operate with a business model that assumed the availability of funding, and mainly competed for market share in lending out the available funds. This is one of the things that has changed since the GFC. With investors now much more discerning in their risk assessments, banks have had to compete harder in the deposit and other funding 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  markets, and this is changing the way they do business. I will return to this point later when I conclude. A final area to mention in briefly rounding up the pre-crisis environment is the growth of the wealth management sector. Funds under management (principally in superannuation and life offices) expanded from around 30 to around 130 per cent of GDP between 1985 and 2007, broadly matching the growth rate seen in the deposit and loan sector. And, of course, there has been a huge growth in services related to asset and risk management, including securities and derivatives trading. Many of these developments had their counterparts in overseas financial systems, which is not surprising because the same sorts of forces were at work. The majority of high-income economies experienced high rates of credit growth and in some cases financial activity expanded even faster than was the case in Australia. In the post-crisis environment these trends have slowed down, halted or in some cases partly reversed. In Australia the credit and debt measures that I cited earlier have been broadly stable for the past five years. Internationally, credit has contracted in nominal terms in some markets. There has also been a big change in attitudes and perceptions about financial risk. Although confidence in global markets has partly returned, risk appetite now is clearly not what it was. And certain kinds of financial activity, particularly in wholesale, securities and derivatives markets have settled at much lower levels than they were in the pre-crisis period. All of this raises the question as to what the new normal might look like in our financial systems. Has the world changed forever? To what extent can we expect the earlier causal factors driving financial change to reassert themselves? In thinking about this, I find it useful to categorise these causal factors into three groups. I see these as being conceptually distinct even though they are likely to interact in complex ways in practice. In the first group are the long-run forces driven by trends in incomes, technology and demographics. Viewed in the abstract, there are a number of reasons to think that financial activity might be able to grow faster than the general economy for sustained periods, and even that this configuration might be some kind of norm. On the demand side it seems plausible that, as people get richer, more of their income can be spent on financial services, including debt servicing, as proportionately less needs to be spent on necessities. Associated with this, the relative value of scarce assets that are financed by debt might be expected to rise over time. And the combination of increasing wealth and greater longevity in our societies is likely to generate rising demand for services in the wealth management and retirement income sector. On the supply side, the key point is that finance is an information-intensive industry. Its key outputs depend on the capacity to store, analyse and transmit information securely. We’re not actually very good at measuring the real value of financial outputs and hence not good either at measuring productivity in the sector. But it would be surprising if the ongoing advances in information technology were not generating significant growth in finance industry productivity relative to that in less information-intensive sectors. This is a process that can continue as long as the technology itself goes on improving. So there are some valid reasons to think that both supply and demand for financial services can grow faster than nominal incomes over time, other things being unchanged. The second set of forces to consider are the one-off factors that made this particular quarter century, in financial terms, unique. One of these I have already alluded to: the financial deregulation that took place around the world mainly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Fundamentally, we have moved from a situation where credit was price-controlled and quantity-rationed, to one where credit availability is market determined. It is probably fair to say that the credit expansions that followed this shift around the world were larger and more 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  protracted than many had expected. Nonetheless, it was by nature a one-time adjustment, and one that has probably now run its course. Another factor in the one-off category is the transition to low inflation and the consequent fall in nominal interest rates. In the late 1980s, mortgage interest rates in Australia reached a now unimaginable 17 per cent. Although that peak was partly cyclical, it also partly reflected the inflation premium built into the interest rate structure. As inflation expectations and nominal interest rates came down in the 1990s, there was a corresponding increase in the average household’s capacity to borrow. As a simple illustrative calculation, if we assume a debt service ratio of 30 per cent on a standard 25 year mortgage, a household’s borrowing capacity would have gone from around two times annual income in the late 1980s to something like four times income a decade and a half later. Taken in combination with the removal of regulatory constraints on credit supply, this would go a long way towards explaining the quarter-century rise in household debt ratios.1 The adjustment to this new reality seems to have been spread over a fairly lengthy period of time. But again, with inflation having been low and stable for more than two decades now, it can be seen as essentially a one-off factor that has probably run its course. My third category of forces are those associated with the cyclical dynamics of credit and asset prices. The financial sector has a well-documented capacity to engage in bouts of overexpansion, driven by self-reinforcing expectations and followed by periods of readjustment and consolidation. Credit cycles of this nature can be unpredictable in duration, ranging from the short and sharp to longer episodes spanning a decade or more. But we can think of these dynamics as being superimposed on the longer-term forces that I’ve already described. Even though these forces might be conceptually distinct, they are in practice likely to be highly interconnected. A financial bubble doesn’t usually come out of nowhere. Typically it starts as a well-based reaction to some genuinely new event, but then develops a self-fulfilling momentum of its own, often with elements of irresponsibility, dishonesty and outright fraud as part of the mix. Globally, there were certainly elements of bubble-like behaviour in the few years leading up to the GFC. But we can also pose the question of whether the world financial system overexpanded on a longer timescale, maybe a quarter-century scale, in reacting to the various forces that I’ve been describing. Did the financial sector in aggregate become too big relative to the size of the real economy? And if so, does that mean we are in for a period of ongoing correction to restore the balance? It is hard to be definitive about these things, but a few observations seem relevant: • First of all, it seems clear that at least some parts of the world financial system did overexpand by a significant margin. To cite some extreme cases, the total assets of the Irish banking system peaked in 2009 at a ratio of 9 times that country’s annual GDP, a figure way outside its own (and other countries’) historical experience. Iceland’s ratio peaked at 7 times. In the UK, the peak was around 5, and in France 4. All of these numbers are high by the standards of longer-run experience (Graph 3).                                                  1  This is a point that the Bank has been making for some time. See RBA (2003), “Household Debt: What the Data Show”, RBA Bulletin, March, pp 1–11 and Ellis L (2005), “Disinflation and the Dynamics of Mortgage Debt”, BIS Papers No 22, pp 5–20, available at <http://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap22b.pdf>. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Graph 3  • Behaviour in the post-crisis period in most economies is consistent with a period of private sector financial consolidation. Ratios of credit or banking assets to GDP have tended to stabilise or decline, particularly in the countries where they had previously been highest. • The combination of regulatory and private sector responses around the world seems likely to result in reduced financial risk-taking in the foreseeable future. Regulators are taking much-needed action to ensure that risks are better managed, and the appetite for financial risk in the household and business sectors now is clearly much less than it was. • In Australia the banking sector did expand relative to the economy, but it remains significantly smaller than many others. On the rough metric of banking assets to GDP, Australia’s ratio is about 2, which is well within the international range and well below those in the euro area, the UK and Japan. So to the extent that any generalised financial overhang exists, it is less likely to be a problem here than elsewhere. • That said, attitudes to risk and debt accumulation in the Australian household sector have clearly changed. Saving rates are up, the appetite for new debt is down, and attitudes to both the level and composition of household saving have become more conservative (Graph 4). 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Graph 4  So what of the future? To return to my three sets of causal factors: • There are some reasons to think that longer-run trends in income and demographics can contribute to further growth of the financial sector over time. • However, much of the expansion over the pre-GFC quarter-century was driven by one-off factors, notably the adjustments to deregulation and low inflation. These adjustments have now run their course. • And, while we can’t be definitive, it is plausible that the world financial system has overexpanded in relative terms and needs a period of readjustment, though this is less likely to be a major factor in Australia than elsewhere. The ongoing development of the financial system in the post-crisis period will depend on the interplay of those three factors. On any reading, it seems clear that this will be an environment where it is harder in general for banks and for the system as a whole to grow. While it is difficult to specify what that might mean in numerical terms, a return to financial sector growth rates consistently higher than the growth of nominal GDP seems unlikely for the foreseeable future. That is my first concluding comment. My other comment concerns the nature of competition. The pre-GFC quarter century was an unusual period, in that competition in financial intermediation came to be focused mainly on the lending side of the balance sheet. That now looks to have been an aberration, and we seem to be entering a period where significant competition on both sides of the balance sheet becomes the norm. It might take some time to get used to this new reality. But in general I see it as a healthy development because it will mean banks being under greater market discipline to manage their risks. And of course, regulators will be doing their part on that front as well. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Pang: Islamic capital and money markets Welcoming remarks by Mr Peter Pang, Deputy Chief Executive, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the workshop on “Islamic capital and money markets”, Hong Kong, 19 March 2013. *      *      * Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, 1. It is my great pleasure to welcome you to this Islamic finance workshop. We are particularly grateful to Mr. Mohd. Radzuan, Mr. Azidy and Mr. Azahari, the experts from Malaysia, who have flown all the way to Hong Kong to share with us their knowledge on Islamic capital and money markets and their valuable experience in developing these critical components of Islamic finance. I would also like to thank Mr. Najmuddin of Bank Negara Malaysia for bringing the Malaysian delegation here. Two fast developing asset classes in the global markets 2. This workshop comes at a very opportune time as Hong Kong is looking to develop Islamic finance as a way to diversify our financial platform and further enhance our capability as an international financial centre. In my view, to be a truly international financial centre, one needs to develop a conducive platform for the two fast developing asset classes in the global markets – Islamic financial products and RMB-denominated investment assets.  3. The development of Islamic financial markets has been phenomenal in the past two decades. The size of global Islamic finance assets made a quantum leap from only US$150 billion in the mid-1990s to US$1.3 trillion at the end of 2011.1 Although the investment climate has been clouded by the US sub-prime crisis and the European sovereign debt problems in recent years, the global sukuk market is powering ahead. Indeed, last year was the best year for the global sukuk market on record, with sukuk issuances growing by more than 60% year-on-year, taking the outstanding sukuk amount to a new height of US$240 billion.2 According to some market estimates, the size of the global Islamic finance industry has the potential to increase five-fold from the current level to some US$6.5 trillion by 2020.3 4. The development of RMB-denominated investment products is equally impressive. In a short space of 6 years, the size of the RMB dim sum bond market in Hong Kong has grown from a modest amount of 10 billion yuan in 2007 to 237 billion yuan at the end of 2012. Offshore RMB financial products have also become more diversified, expanding from only RMB bonds to RMB equities, RMB investment funds, RMB A-share exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as well as RMB insurance products. The growth momentum of the offshore RMB financial markets is expected to pick up further, as more and more financing and investment activities can now be conducted in RMB, especially following the introduction by the Mainland authorities of the arrangements for inward and outward direct investments in RMB and the RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (i.e. RQFII) scheme. 5. Hong Kong is fortunate to have made a good start in offshore RMB business. Since the introduction of offshore RMB business in 2004, we have developed a wide variety of RMB-denominated financial products. In particular, the offshore RMB bond market in Hong Kong is by far the largest in the world. We also possess the largest RMB liquidity pool outside of                                                 1  KFH Research. 2  Zawya. 3  KFH Research. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Mainland China. As at the end of 2012, the aggregate amount of RMB customer deposits and certificates of deposits has reached a high of 720 billion yuan. Notwithstanding these, when it comes to Islamic finance, Hong Kong is a relative newcomer and would need to catch up in this area.  Legislative exercise to promote the development of sukuk market 6. In developing Islamic finance, we are taking a step by step approach. As a first step, our current focus is to put in place the supporting legal infrastructure. Specifically, the HKSAR Government is set to change the tax laws in Hong Kong to facilitate the development of the sukuk market. In terms of economic substance, sukuk are no different from conventional bonds. However, since Islamic law prohibits the payment and receipt of interest, sukuk are often structured with the use of special purpose vehicles and multiple transfers of underlying assets. This may result in additional tax liabilities and hence higher issuance costs for sukuk when compared with conventional bonds under the existing tax regime.   7. It is therefore necessary to refine our tax laws to provide a tax framework for sukuk that is comparable to the one applying to conventional bonds. But this does not mean that we are going to confer special tax favours on the Islamic finance sector; rather, our aim is to level the playing field so that financial instruments of similar economic substance will be given similar tax treatments. 8. On this, I am very pleased to see that an amendment bill has been introduced into the Legislative Council earlier this year. The bill adopts a prescriptive and religion-neutral approach, and covers five of the most common types of sukuk globally. Products that can meet the key features and qualifying conditions specified in the bill will be given tax treatments similar to those currently afforded to conventional bonds. This means that sukuk issuers and investors alike will no longer be subject to additional tax and stamp duty charges over and above what they would need to pay for conventional bonds. So, passage of the bill will be a very positive step forward in furthering the development of Islamic finance in Hong Kong.  Synergy between Hong Kong and Malaysia 9. With the legal infrastructure to be in place soon, the next important step will be to develop the Islamic financial markets here. We definitely have a lot to learn from Malaysia in respect of product development and market operation. As I see it, Hong Kong and Malaysia each has different edges in the financial services industry, and the potential synergy between the two places in developing the Islamic financial markets is tremendous.   10. Malaysia is undoubtedly an important leading centre in the global Islamic finance industry that has accumulated vast experiences and invaluable expertise over the past three decades. It has developed a well-diversified Islamic financial market, offering a full suite of products covering sukuk, Islamic equities, Islamic funds, Islamic ETFs, etc. Its sukuk market is by far the largest in the world, accounting for more than 70% of global sukuk issuances last year.4 It has also put in place well-developed financial infrastructure which can facilitate local and overseas market players alike in conducting Islamic financial transactions. 11. On the other hand, Hong Kong as an international financial centre has developed a deep and highly liquid capital market with a diverse base of investors coming from all around the world. More importantly, with Hong Kong’s unique role as a gateway to Mainland China and a leading hub for offshore RMB business, Hong Kong can offer an ideal platform to link Islamic and RMB financing together by developing financial products that are Shariah-                                                4  Zawya.

Through Hong Kong’s platform, international investors in the Islamic world can easily tap the appealing growth story of the Mainland. This is especially given the fact that many investors are now actively looking for investment opportunities in Asia, particularly Mainland China, to diversify their investment portfolios. At the same time, Mainland issuers can also make use of our platform to reach out to the increasingly wealthy investor base in the Islamic world.  12. Clearly, there is a strong foundation for both sides to work together to complement each other, grow the pie bigger and achieve a win-win proposition in developing Islamic finance. For this important reason, the HKMA entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Bank Negara Malaysia in 2009 to strengthen mutual co-operation in the area of Islamic finance. We are very pleased to have worked closely with Bank Negara Malaysia to put together and bring this workshop to Hong Kong under the framework of the MoU. Building a deep talent pool is crucial for further development of the Islamic finance industry. Workshops of this kind will undoubtedly help to promote market awareness and knowledge of Islamic finance, while also providing an excellent forum for market players to exchange views and business contacts. We will continue to work closely with the Treasury Markets Association to raise the expertise in Islamic finance in Hong Kong.  13. Apart from our continuous efforts to put in place a conducive platform, it is also crucial for market players to maximize their readiness to grasp the opportunities brought by the development of Islamic finance in Hong Kong. After all, market players will be the ones who drive the growth of the market ultimately. So, I highly encourage you all to gear up for the new opportunities ahead of us. On this, I am pleased to note that some financial institutions have already started to get ready by mobilizing their staff in the Middle East or Malaysia to Hong Kong, as well as providing training to their staff in Hong Kong. The fact that you are here today is also a good indication that you are keen to prepare yourselves. I hope you would take the most out of this workshop. 14. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Anand Sinha: Governance in banks and financial institutions Address by Mr Anand Sinha, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, delivered on his behalf, at the L & T Management Development Centre, Lonavla, 19 March 2013. *      *      * Inputs provided by Thomas Mathew, Ms. Sindhu Pancholy and Jayakumar Yarasi are gratefully acknowledged. Shri Deosthalee and senior management of L & T. A very good evening. I deem it a privilege to address you this evening on “Governance in banks and financial institutions”. Governance issues have been engaging the attention of policy makers, more intensely in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Many instances of governance failures have come to the fore as the contributory factors that had exacerbated the crisis. With lessons learnt from the crisis, the framework is being revisited so as to strengthen the governance standards. What is governance? What exactly is Governance? Governance, in general terms, means the process of decision making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented),1 involving multiple actors. Good governance is one which is accountable, transparent, responsive, equitable and inclusive, effective and efficient, participatory and which is consensus oriented and which follows the rule of law. The 1992 Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance (Cadbury Report) describes corporate governance as the system by which companies are directed and controlled. As per Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Corporate Governance involves2 “a set of relationships between a company’s management, its board, its shareholders, and other stake holders. Corporate Governance also provides the structure through which the objectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance are determined. Good corporate governance should provide proper incentives for the board and management to pursue objectives that are in the interests of the company and its shareholders and should facilitate effective monitoring. The presence of an effective corporate governance system, within an individual company or group and across an economy as a whole, helps to provide a degree of confidence that is necessary for the proper functioning of a market economy”. The whole gamut of corporate governance could be considered as a blend of various segments3 namely, regulatory governance, market governance, stake holder governance and internal governance. For an economy to perform well and for the financial system to be stable, good corporate governance would be required across all these segments. Regulatory governance refers to control exercised by regulators over firms through statutes, policies and regulations. Market governance denotes the use of market based controls which discipline the corporate behaviour. While stakeholder governance alludes to the direct or indirect control by various stakeholder groups having direct or indirect interest in the corporations, internal governance refers to the institutional arrangement of checks and balances within the corporation.                                                 1 United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, “What is good governance” 2 OECD Principles of Corporate Governance(2004) 3 Sun, Willian, Stewart, Jim and Pollard, David; “A systemic failure of corporate governance: Lessons from the on-going financial crisis” 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Why is corporate governance important for financial institutions? While good governance is essential for any entity, it has deeper significance for financial institutions. There are many compelling reasons, some of which are: a. Financial institutions are central to economic activity – banks and a large part of the non-banking financial system (the shadow banking system) undertake credit intermediation. Failures of financial institutions would thus impede the economic growth and would cause serious damage to the system. Economies take longer time to rebound from financial crisis than the business cycle recessions. b. Financial institutions operate on a higher leverage. As per a study by the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) for the period 1995–2009, compared to non-financial institutions that had a leverage of about 3, banks operated at a leverage of 18.3 while non-bank financial firms had a leverage of 12.1. Higher leverage makes financial intermediaries more vulnerable to shocks. From a systemic perspective, the inheren procyclicality of the financial system leads to the build up of high leverage during upturn phase of the economy which amplifies booms and busts. Therefore, while the procyclicality issues need to be dealt with from a financial stability perspective, it is apparent that these financial institutions must be well governed for achieving financial stability. c. Financial institutions, especially banks, deal in people’s savings and trust of customers forms the cornerstone of their existence. Any breach of trust leading to loss of confidence is bound to lead to a run, not just on a particular bank but on others too who are perceived to have weakness or even similar business models. The non bank financial intermediaries who lose the trust of their lenders would not be able to raise resources at a reasonable cost making it hard for them to operate efficiently and profitably. All these can lead to snowballing effect impairing the functioning of the entire financial system due to interconnectedness. Good governance ensures customers’ and other stakeholders’ trust in banks and non-banking financial intermediaries. d. Among the financial intermediaries, banks occupy a special place due to their centrality in the transmission of monetary policy and the functioning of the payment and settlement systems. They also are the beneficiaries of deposit insurance which may weaken their incentive for strong management monitoring as well as monitoring by other stakeholders including depositors. Good corporate governance would ensure strong internal controls which would offset the weakened incentive for monitoring. A robust and stable banking system is an absolute necessity for a well functioning economy. Corporate governance – international experience Academic literature suggests that post 2000, significant developments happened in the corporate governance framework internationally. For e.g., in the US, corporate scandals including Enron and World Com resulting from failure in corporate governance, led to Sarbanes–Oxley Act with an aim to improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures by way of enhanced oversight role of Boards, corporate responsibility, certification of accuracy of financial transactions by Top Management, setting standards for auditor independence etc. However, it is widely acknowledged that even the enhanced framework could not mitigate the weaknesses which played a significant role in contributing to the global financial crisis (GFC). There are ongoing debates regarding the manner in which flawed governance practices played their part in the crisis. While poor implementation is blamed by some, systemic failure of corporate governance is attributed by others as the cause. OECD and UK Financial 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Regulatory Council share the view that the shortcomings were not with the Corporate Governance codes / principles per se, but were in their implementation. Governance and ethics Lack of ethics too played a significant part in the erosion of governance standards in institutions. Values and culture define ethics. Ethics are principles that recommend proper conduct, help distinguish right from wrong and drive people to do the right thing even when no one is looking. While ethical behaviour is a minimum requirement for any dealing or transaction, it becomes all the more essential for financial intermediaries, and particularly for banks, for whom trust is the cornerstone. Honest and prudent behaviour by banks and other financial intermediaries is integral to their reputation and public confidence in the system. However, the conduct of financial institutions that caused the crisis does not suggest any measure of enduring interaction between ethics and banking. In fact, financial markets and entities displayed significant moral bankruptcy through the period spanning pre-crisis, crisis year and beyond. Some of the recent high profile events have emphatically highlighted the complete lack of ethics in some financial institutions. London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) rigging episode wherein a few financial institutions colluded in rigging the LIBOR so as to profit from the trades or to give an inflated impression about their creditworthiness shook the world. LIBOR is one of the most important interest rates and is used for pricing of about USD 800 trillion worth of financial instruments (reportedly 11 times the GDPs of all nations on earth). There are several such episodes. Closer home too, in India, we have witnessed a few high profile cases which have shaken the public trust in the financial system. Satyam, once regarded as having good corporate governance, was found to have been deeply involved in one of India’s biggest corporate frauds. The 1992 securities scam which brought out the nexus between bankers and brokers led to massive overhaul of the financial system in India. The unethical practices adopted by some banks in recent past in selling inappropriate financial products (exotic derivatives) to their corporate customers and the unfair and unscrupulous methods adopted by some microfinance institutions (MFIs) in their operations are some recent reminders of erosion of ethics in the financial system. Causes of governance failure A systemic failure of corporate governance means the failure of the whole set of regulatory, market, stakeholder and internal governance, which has largely contributed to the on-going financial crisis.4 a. Regulatory governance failure: The regulatory framework in the pre-crisis period was veering more towards deregulation and liberalization. The Chinese wall that separated investment banking from retail banking was brought down with the repeal of Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which led to the proliferation of universal banks. While this enabled the institutions to achieve economies of scale and scope, it also led to transmission of risks of investment banking into retail banking. The exemption from regulation of OTC derivatives enabled by the passage of Commodity Futures Modernisation Act 2000 is alleged to have encouraged excessive trading in Credit Default Swaps which were an important feature of the global crisis. Other regulatory dispensations such as permitting banks to move massive amounts of assets and liabilities off balance sheet through structured investment vehicles also fuelled the                                                 4 Sun, Willian, Stewart, Jim and Pollard, David; “A systemic failure of corporate governance: Lessons from the on-going financial crisis” 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  crisis. Further, the regulatory gaps which led to proliferation of shadow banking entities have also been significantly instrumental in exacerbating the crisis. There were lapses in the supervisory framework also. In the run-up to the crisis, it was observed that the supervisors were staying on the sidelines and not intruding sufficiently into the affairs of participants. They were not being proactive in dealing with the emerging risks and in adapting to changing environment. There was a lack of capacity to identify, or to act on identification. For example, supervisors could not see the risks building up when banks started dealing in very complex products or when banks started relying excessively on short term funding sources for their operations. Supervision was not comprehensive and even when supervisors found some anomaly, it was not taken to conclusion. b. Market Governance failure: The prevailing dogma prior to the crisis was that markets were always right and will find their own balance, left to themselves. There was unflinching faith in the invisible hand of markets, despite the well known fat tails in statistical distributions representing herd behaviour of markets signifying irrationality driven by excessive optimism or pessimism. However, the crisis established that markets are indeed fallible. As observed by Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics, when information is imperfect, markets do not often work well and information imperfections are central in finance. c. Stakeholder governance failure: The crisis has also highlighted the failure on the part of various stakeholders who did not have active involvement in corporate governance. d. Internal Governance failure: It is observed that the lapses in internal systems and controls such as Board oversight, managerial competence, compensation policies, audit etc. were instrumental in exacerbating the crisis Let me now briefly touch upon some of the specific internal governance failures in the financial institutions that have contributed to and/or exacerbated the crisis. a. Complex and opaque organizational structures: There was a massive growth in the complexity of organizational structures in the pre-crisis period, with a view to taking advantage of regulatory arbitrage and also of gaps in regulations. Regulators found it difficult to look through the structures and enforce regulation. Many times, such complex structures fell in the gaps between regulatory jurisdictions and escaped regulations. b. Inadequate Oversight by Board: Boards were found to be not actively involved in formulating risk appetite framework of firms. Incomplete risk information due to gaps in MIS coupled with inadequate understanding of risk due to the lack of expertise among the directors, hampered effective and timely decision making. Improper pricing of risk led to suboptimal allocation of capital and inadequate preparation for the tail events eventually leading to the precipitation of the crisis. c. Weaknesses in the Senior Management: Senior management failed to adopt and integrate necessary systems to identify, manage and report risk. The misalignment of incentives also resulted in the management pursuing objectives which, at times, were at cross purposes to those of the firm. d. Proliferation of complex products: There was a significant spurt in the complexity of financial products in the run-up to the crisis. Abundance of cheap liquidity prodded the participants to innovate ways to deploy the funds and earn a return. Complexity and opacity led to inadequate understanding and mispricing of risk. The long chain of transactions also obfuscated the true risks inherent in the transactions and led to a false sense of comfort. e. Flawed remuneration policies: Compensation structures which focussed excessively on short term performance incentivised managers to take excessive risks in order to 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  meet the short term objectives at the expense of long term sustainability of the firm. Further, the framework where the participants get to keep the gains while the losses are assured to be borne by the society (either explicitly by the government guarantee or implicitly due to the inevitable governments’ intervention to bail out due to systemic concerns), was an incentive for participants to take-up risky activities. Equity incentives, put in place with the objective to align managers’ incentives with those of shareholders, may also have induced managers to take excessive risks. f. Weak risk management systems and internal controls: With significant developments in technology, risk management in the run up to the crisis became highly quantitative on the lines of an exact science. Models proliferated with a false assurance to capture and measure every kind of risk. It is said that economists suffered from a syndrome of Physics envy. The models tried to anticipate the future based on assumptions of normality and on the basis of past data. In their exuberance, quants, however, forgot that the assumption of normality does not correspond to reality, particularly, in highly stressed situations. For example, the probability of a 5-sigma loss on any given day would mean that such an occurrence should happen once in about 14,000 years (assuming 250 trading days in a year) that is much longer than the period of time that has elapsed since civilisation evolved.5 During the crisis the Wall Street Journal (2007) reported that events that models predicted would happen only once in 10,000 years, happened every day for 3 days. Further, the assumption, or rather the dogma, which was the basis of many models, that future could be predicted on the basis of past data, led to disastrous outcomes. With the rapid development of technology, increased integration of markets and entry of sophisticated players, the present and the future are much different from the past and it would be very naïve to predict the future based on the past data. g. Inadequate emphasis on financial literacy and consumer protection: While the complexity of financial products was increasing, inadequate attention was paid to imparting financial education to the public. Financial literacy would not only to enable customers to make use of the available products but, more importantly, help them understand the inherent risks in the products and to guard themselves if the financial institutions indulged in mis-selling and other unfair practices. International initiatives in strengthening corporate governance Global crisis has highlighted the significance of good corporate governance for the survival and well functioning of financial institutions. The Senior Supervisors’ Group’s Report “Observations on Risk Management Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence” (March 2008) confirms that the financial institutions which survived the crisis better were those who had, among others, informative and responsive risk measurement and management reporting and practices. The blend of qualitative and quantitative analysis provided a high level of insight and consistent communication to management of evolving conditions, enabling the firm to respond effectively to emerging opportunities and risks. With lessons drawn from the crisis, policy makers have revisited the extant corporate governance framework and have issued guidance with a view to addressing the gaps witnessed and strengthening the governance framework. The OECD Steering Group on Corporate Governance, which examined the governance failures, observed that while the corporate governance weaknesses in remuneration, risk management, board practices and the exercise of shareholder rights had played an important role in the development of global crisis, the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance issued in 2004, nevertheless, provided                                                 5 Dowd, Kevin and Hutchinson, Martin, “Alchemists of Loss”, Times Group Books 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  a good basis to adequately address the key concerns that have been raised and that there was no urgent need for them to be revisited. The Group opined that the more urgent challenge was to encourage and support the implementation of already agreed international and national standards including the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has revisited its 2006 guidance on corporate governance and brought out Principles for enhancing corporate governance (Oct 2010). The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has, in its progress report to the G20 Ministers and Governors (Nov 2012) also made recommendations relating to the corporate governance issues of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Risk governance There is an enhanced realisation that the risk governance demands a holistic approach and that risk appreciation should start at the top. A strengthened management information system (MIS) supported by robust information technology platform is a necessary pre-condition for enhancing Board efficiency in oversight and decision making. Similarly, augmented skill sets and experience at the level of independent directors would go a long way in enhancing the Board capacity. Strong MIS facilitates risk reporting to the boards in an effective and comprehensive manner, which in turn enhances transparency and causes informed decision taking. Robust information technology systems are a necessary condition for supporting the MIS framework as the quality of risk information that the Boards and the top management receive depends largely on the quality and robustness of the information technology systems.6 In addition to prescribing the risk appetite for the institution, the board also needs to lay down appropriate risk strategy and ensure that this is institutionalised throughout the organization. This would entail, aligning risk management processes with the overall business strategy, clearly defining the roles and responsibilities down the hierarchy, establishing accountability and reinforcing change with communication and training. The Board and the senior management oversight must be supplemented with effective leadership by the Chairman and the chief executive officer (CEO), and informed non-executive directors. The Boards must get much more intimately involved in risk matters and have a firmer understanding of the key risks faced by the business. Effective risk governance also demands that each director is aware of the breadth of risks faced by the bank. Directors add value to the Board when they have financial expertise, are aware of risk fundamentals and techniques, and are able to manage dynamics with executives. Board level risk committees have an important role to play in the overall risk governance framework. Apart from monitoring the firm’s strategic-risk profile on an on-going basis, such committees would also be responsible for defining the firm’s overall risk appetite; approving major transactions above a firm’s risk threshold, and; establishing limit structures and risk policies for use within individual businesses. Presence of a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is expected to strengthen the risk management framework. However, independence of the CRO, with necessary stature to influence decisions, would be a critical element in ensuring the effectiveness of the post in risk management process as also the strategic risk management related decisions. The CRO must report directly to the CEO and the Board and be responsible for all risks, risk management and control functions. Another important requirement is integrating risk with business strategy and compensation. Risk – and return on risk – need to be core component of any performance measure, and should be explicitly factored into incentive and                                                 6 Group of Thirty, “Toward Effective Governance of Financial Institutions” 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  compensation schemes. Compensation must be formally aligned with actual performance, such as through adding more rigorous risk-based measures to scorecards. This would also involve moving to longer vesting periods, and increasing deferred compensation. The fragmented organisation of risk data into separate silos slows down risk management process and hinders the capability to respond to new regulatory requirements. The financial crisis has pushed both supervisors and market players to move towards an integrated approach to risk data that brings down the silos in organisation. Only by integrating data models, processes and methodologies can a bank achieve higher performance in terms of data quality. The risk management systems must take into account the technical limitations of risk models, such as Value at Risk (VaR). Stress testing and scenario analysis need to be established as truly effective management tools and should be integrated and standardized across business lines, types of risk and asset classes. Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s thematic review on risk governance The Financial Stability Board (FSB) in its Thematic Review on Risk Governance7 has observed that since crisis, national authorities have taken several measures to improve regulatory and supervisory oversight of risk governance at financial institutions such as developing or strengthening existing regulation or guidance, raising supervisory expectations for the risk management function, engaging more frequently with the board and the management, and assessing the accuracy and usefulness of the information provided to the Board to enable effective discharge of responsibilities. The evaluation also found that in many jurisdictions, the governance practices are more advanced that those prescribed under national guidance. This, the report opined, may have been motivated by firms’ need to regain market confidence rather than regulatory requirements. The results of the Review support the finding that the firms in the regions hardest hit by the financial crisis have made the most progress. However, there are significant gaps relative to the criteria developed, particularly in risk management. The report points to the differences in progress across regions. While firms in advanced economies have adopted more of the desirable risk governance practices, nearly 65 per cent of the firms that reside in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) did not meet all of the criteria for the risk management function. The report notes that more work needs to be done in the areas such as elevation of CRO position, establishment of an effective risk appetite framework (RAF), improving the chief audit executive (CAE)’s access to directors beyond those on the audit committee, etc. Indian scenario Corporate governance of banks Banking regulation in India shifted from prescriptive mode to prudential mode in 1990s, which implied a shift in balance away from regulation and towards corporate governance. Banks are accorded greater freedom and flexibility to draw up their own business plans and implementation strategies consistent with their comparative advantage. This freedom necessitated tighter governance standards requiring bank boards to assume the primary responsibility and the directors to be more knowledgeable and aware and also exercise informed judgement on various strategies and policy choices. With a view to strengthen corporate governance, over a period of time, various guidelines have been issued in matters                                                 7 8 Financial Stability Board (Feb 2013), Thematic Review on Risk Governance, Peer Review Report 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  relating to the role to be played by the Board, fit and proper criteria for the directors of banks, bifurcation of the post of Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), remuneration etc. Recognising that ownership of banks by one or few individuals could be detrimental to the public interest, especially, depositors’ interests, it is stipulated that, in India, banks should have a diversified ownership model. To ensure that ownership and control of banks are well diversified, guidelines on ownership and governance in private sector banks were issued by the Reserve Bank in February 2005. Another important regulatory prescription in this regard is the requirement of Reserve Bank’s prior approval for any acquisition of shares in private sector banks resulting in a shareholding of 5 per cent or more of the total paid up capital of the bank. The importance of diversified ownership is also underlined in the recent guidelines on new bank licenses wherein it is stipulated that Non-Operative Financial Holding Companies (NOFHC) which set up new banks should, after the initial lock in period of five years, bring down their equity capital of the bank from the minimum 40% while setting up to 15% within 12 years. To ensure “Fit and Proper” status of the groups that would set up new banks, it is also stipulated that entities / groups should have a past record of sound credentials and integrity, be financially sound with a successful track record of 10 years. Corporate governance of Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) Traditionally, Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) in India were small family run businesses some of which accepted deposits and engaged mainly in activities such as lending. Over the years, the NBFC sector has not only grown in size but also in terms of interconnectedness and systemic importance. Today, even though the sector has a total asset size constituting just above 12% of that of scheduled commercial banks, some of the NBFCs have grown very big and are operating as conglomerates with business interests spread across insurance, broking, mutual fund, real estate etc. Keeping in consideration the growing significance of NBFCs in the financial system and their interconnectedness with the banking sector there is a strong case for strengthening their governance framework so as to not only protect the individual institutions and their depositors, but also to ensure the stability of the entire financial system. Further, NBFCs have exposures to sensitive sectors such as real estate and capital markets and they also rely on wholesale funding, all of which point to the requirement of robust internal controls and governance framework to ensure their stability. During the crisis, while none of the shortcomings as observed globally during the GFC manifested in any significant way in the Indian NBFC sector, a temporary crisis of confidence did emanate which affected some of the NBFCs. The lack of confidence exposed the shortcomings in the funding model and consequent problems in the overall risk management framework of these NBFCs which were relying heavily on short term wholesale sources such as mutual funds to fund long term assets. Further, certain shortcomings in the corporate governance were observed in a section of NBFCs viz; those in the microfinance institutions (MFI) sector, leading to near collapse of the sector. Distorted financial incentives such as short term profit maximization / undue profiteering and excessive managerial compensation that were the hallmarks of the GFC were the leading contributors to the MFI crisis. The corporate governance issues in the MFI sector were exacerbated by some of the “for profit” MFIs, dominated and controlled by promoter shareholders which led to inadequate internal checks and balances over executive decision making and conflict of interests at various levels. Other undesirable practices such as connected lending, excessively generous compensation for senior management and founders/ directors and the failure of internal controls leading to frauds, precipitated the crisis. Some of the MFIs are also alleged to have chased high growth trajectory at the expense of corporate best practices. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  While drawing comparisons between the US subprime crisis and Indian MFI crisis, in an article titled “Microfinance Industry in India: Some thoughts” in Economic and Political Weekly (EPW) (October 8, 2011), Dr. Y.V.Reddy, former Governor, RBI, had observed that opaque practices, high salaries and commissions including unethical business and leverage were prevalent in MFIs. Recognizing the significance of NBFCs in the overall financial system, measures were undertaken to strengthen the regulatory framework in terms of stipulation of capital adequacy and exposure norms in 2006. Subsequentlyin2007, guidelines on corporate governance for NBFCs were issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The listed NBFCs were already required to comply with the provisions of the Listing Agreement of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), others being governed by the relevant provisions in the Companies Act, 1956. While the frameworks laid down by the various regulators / Companies Act may appear similar and over lapping in some areas, there are a few differences. Companies Act does not differentiate between financial, non-financial companies and SEBI Guidelines are generally from the perspective of investor protection with emphasis on disclosure and transparency. Therefore, RBI being the prudential regulator of NBFCs, additionally lays emphasis on risk management framework and the business practices etc. and its framework is mainly from the angle of depositor / customer protection. Reserve Bank’s guidelines on corporate governance are applicable to only NBFCs with certain threshold of business i.e. with a certain deposit base or asset size. Recent developments in NBFC sector Reserve Bank has recently issued draft guidelines on corporate governance of NBFCs based on the recommendations of the Working Group on the issues and concerns in the NBFC sector (Chair: Ms. Usha Thorat). The guidelines aim to fine tune the framework for NBFCs by aligning the same with the businesses that they deal in and the growth in size, interconnectedness and systemic importance of the sector. The Guidelines address issues such as multiple directorships, continuing due diligence process with a reporting requirement to RBI, self certified “fit and proper” criteria and disclosures that are specific to NBFCs’ business, such as disclosures on provision coverage ratio, Asset Liability profile, movement of NPAs, off-balance sheet exposures, structured products issued by them etc. Other requirements include prior approval of RBI for change in control of any registered NBFCs. It is indicated that big NBFCs with asset size of Rs. 1000 crore and above would require prior approval of RBI for appointment of CEO and would need to comply with Clause 49 provisions (of SEBI listing agreement) even if unlisted. NBFCs with asset size of Rs. 100 crore and above would be required to comply with the disclosure requirements specified in Clause 49 and of certain financial indicators. Given the recent episodes in the MFI sector, the corporate governance guidelines for MFIs have also been revamped. Measures are aimed at checking undesirable business practices like multiple lending, alleged coercive practices and charging excessive interest rates, etc. The guidelines are aimed at enhancing the “self discipline principle” in these NBFCs. Measures include pricing of credit, restricting lending to a borrower by not more than two MFIs, sharing credit information with a Credit Information Bureau, review of Fair Practices Code (FPC) etc. A Self Regulatory Organisation (SRO) also is envisaged for the sector as a watchdog. While the final framework is still being evolved, the role envisaged for the present, inter alia, is to ensure good governance in the industry by way of client protection with enforcement powers to check violations to codes of conduct / regulations. Conclusion Governance, like regulation, is an evolving concept and is continuously fine tuned to suit the dynamic economic and business environment. Global financial crisis has given us an 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  opportunity for strengthening both the regulatory as well as governance frameworks, by highlighting gaps that exacerbated the crisis. There is an interesting debate over whether and how much regulation can substitute board level governance. While regulation is imposed from outside, corporate governance is internal and is more in the nature of self regulation which ensures that the principles and rules laid down by the regulations are scrupulously adhered to. Prior to the crisis, the emphasis was increasingly on self regulation through robust corporate governance so that the regulation could remain largely principle based and less prescriptive. However, serious lapses observed in governance framework during the crisis, tilted the balance in favour of more rigorous regulation. I am of the view that both regulation and corporate governance have to complement each other. Effective regulation furthers corporate governance and effective corporate governance ensures that the objectives of the regulation are met, with minimal regulatory intervention.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Building broader horizons in 2013 Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank of the Philippines), at the Annual Convention of the Chamber of Thrift Banks, Makati City, 20 March 2013. *      *      * The officers and members of the Chamber of Thrift Banks, under the leadership of outgoing president, Patrick Cheng, and incoming president, Jose Teodoro Limcaoco, Members of the Monetary Board, Fellow BSPers, my colleagues in the banking industry and in government service, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is pleased to once again take part in your annual convention. As I begin my remarks this morning, let me take this opportunity to thank the outgoing officers and members of the board for your efforts. I am pleased that we were able to move forward on several fronts, even as we still have a full plate of reforms. Let me also congratulate your incoming officers. Indeed, to be elected to the CTB board shows the confidence that your peers have in you. More importantly, your accepting such a challenge underscores your commitment to work for the greater good. A part of the tradition of your convention that I appreciate is the row of display booths one has to pass through as one enters the ballroom. Stalls of the various companies that have grown because of partnership with the industry. To me, the variety and quality of the displays have been an indicator of the state of the thrift banking industry. If this year’s display continues in that tradition, I believe it is telling us that good things are in the offing for the CTB and our economy. What is in the horizon? This brings me to your chosen theme. “Building a Broader Horizon for 2013.” Horizon is an interesting word. It has a couple of meanings and evokes several feelings. One meaning of horizon is that it is the “apparent intersection of the earth and sky.” We’re coming into the summer months. And I am sure, if you find yourself on the beach in the next few weeks, you will discover that it is hard to escape the temptation to stand on the shoreline, maybe barefoot, and then fix your gaze towards the vastness of the ocean – just to see where the ocean and sky seem to meet the horizon. Another meaning of horizon in the Webster dictionary is that it is the “range of one’s perception and experience”. Putting these two meanings together suggests to me that when you chose this topic for this year’s convention, you were actually asking your members to find ways of enlarging “what the industry knows about what it can experience and what it is able to do”. You were, in a sense, asking your members to find ways to enlarge these things to the point where the sky and earth seem to meet. I wish to tell you even now, that in this journey you have chosen, the industry can expect the BSP to provide an operating environment that would allow you to traverse this path, but in a way that makes you also mindful of the impact of your actions – not only on yourselves but also on the rest of the members of the financial eco-system you are in. How shall we broaden the horizon? Your goal for 2013 is clear – to broaden the industry’s horizon. But how would you achieve this? In geometry and in nautical science, I am told practitioners have derived a mathematical formula for calculating the distance to the visible horizon. The exact equation 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  will depend on whether adjustments for refraction, i.e., the distortions due to light, are done or not. But the common element in any of the equations is this – that the distance to the horizon is a function of the height from which you are taking your view. More specifically, the visible horizon will be further from you, the higher you are above the ground. This natural law is quite interesting in that it also applies to the laws of economics. If I were to apply this law to your chosen goal, I would paraphrase as follows. If the CTB wishes to broaden its horizon, the Chamber needs to raise its vantage point. The stage is set Using 2012 as our gauge, I believe you will agree with me that the country has certainly raised its vantage point. When we consider our markets, the environment is indeed more favourable now than it has been in the recent past. The economy expanded by 6.6 percent in 2012 and this growth was matched by generally stable prices as inflation averaged 3.2 percent last year. The high growth-low inflation scenario was further supported by our robust external position. The country’s balance of payments remains in surplus due to investment growth, business process outsourcing receipts and the steady rise in remittances. This led to the further build-up in our Gross International Reserves, which stood at 83.8 billion dollars at end-February. This is about one year’s worth of imports of goods and services, more than adequate by any of the standard measures of adequacy. These positive developments have heightened investor confidence in the country while further expanding the financial services extended by our banks. For the thrift banking industry, your assets rose to Php 666.17 billion last year (up from Php 607.43 billion in 2011 or a growth rate of about 9.7 percent). This was on the back of Php 529.80 billion in deposits and matched by Php 449.27 billion in loans. Given this starting point for 2013, I ask the officers and members of the CTB, can we broaden our horizon? I think the answer should be a resounding yes. We have entered 2013 from a position of strength, and with some momentum. The onus is on you, on us, to make the most of this advantage, to bring you forward in your chosen objective. Opportunities abound – some specific directions I’d like to spend the rest of the time allotted on some specific suggestions for broadening your horizon. A quick review of the industry’s loan portfolio shows that about a third of the industry’s total lending continues to be towards the Real Estate and Construction Businesses. In addition, while such lending remains concentrated toward the acquisition of residential property, there has been an improvement in the take up of loans for commercial purposes, principally from the BPO sector. These trends make the recent approval of the BSP of prudential reference standards for Contract-to-sell (CTS) financing important . Furthermore, against the backdrop of low interest rates and the constant temptation among banks to chase after higher yields, this market approach dovetails quite well with the prudential thrust of the BSP to strengthen credit underwriting practices for real estate activities. The BSP has not yet moved to formal prescriptive regulations at this stage. But, it appreciates the fact that the market itself sought to define the guidelines to streamline market practice since no common standards have been recognized to date. In the context of this year’s convention theme, a market approach such as this can be seen as the industry’s way of broadening its horizon, with financial stability specifically in mind. As we have already taken the steps forward on mortgage finance, perhaps the Chamber can 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  likewise consider similar standards for auto loans in order to ensure that banks don’t end up financing “lemons”. We would also like to see the Chamber actively contributing towards an equivalent effort for credit card receivables and other modes of consumer financing. Business cycles come and go, and therefore it is important that we have the rules of the game squarely in place, so that any market inflection points will not cause instability in the market. As market opportunities expand, we need to also work together so we can maintain strong credit discipline and avoid imprudent lending and investments. Ladies and gentlemen. We are an economy of 96 million Filipinos spread over 7,101 islands. It stands to reason that consumer-related financing, your bread and butter, will be a major factor in the economy. Hence, the BSP’s push to improve credit underwriting standards for consumer loans. But in parallel with this, we believe thrift banks should also actively participate in the culture and practice of financial education and consumer protection. These are not just fancy buzz words. In fact, in the BSP, we take these twin advocacies seriously. Through our economic and financial learning centers (EFLCs) in our head office and 21 regional offices and branches, we undertake outreaches to raise the awareness of the financial consumer so that each of them can make informed saving and investment choices. The BSP has partnered with the Chamber on some of these programs and we look forward to engaging the Chamber even more. We would also like to see individual members of the Chamber embark on your own literacy programs. As a complement, we have created a specialized department in BSP called the Financial Consumer Affairs Group (FCAG). It is set up as a clearing hub for complaints and as a redress mechanism so that those who have clearly been victimized through no fault of their own do not have to suffer the added penalty of delayed attention. Furthermore, the BSP is in the early stages of formalizing specific standards for consumer protection, including how banks should handle consumer complaints. This move is aimed at elevating consumer protection to a stature of a core bank function, and not simply an ancillary advocacy. Let me now leave the world of real estate and consumer finance. And turn to another sector that the Chamber is well-equipped to support. Here I mean the world of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. The Philippines is traditionally an MSME market. And if we are to raise our national economic vantage point and take advantage of the momentum coming into 2013, thrift banks need to consider lending more to this economic segment. I say this because MSMEs provide great employment opportunities. A healthier MSME sector will help ensure our economic growth is broad-based and inclusive. Thrift banks, however, must not just lend more in terms of nominal amounts. The challenge to the industry really is to ensure that such lending continuously creates further opportunities. In this way, MSMEs can be assured of viability, regardless of mandated credit programs. Final thoughts Friends, you want this convention to be a discussion on broadening your horizon, our horizon. In trying to look ahead, I took us through the more scenic route of our recent past. The numbers tell us an encouraging story of growth and consistency of economic and financial stability. However, the paradox of financial stability is that we may just be at our weakest when we believe we are at our strongest position. Complacency often sets in when positive news is continuous and this is reinforced by encouraging market parameters. If we fall into this trap of complacency, we risk losing our focus. For the thrift banking industry, the growth trajectory that many are anticipating suggests even better times ahead. It is therefore in our collective interest, if we wish to truly broaden our horizon, to agree on a common vision where thrift banks have a definitive role to play. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In my remarks, I have suggested specific action points you may consider in order to accomplish just that, and over time broaden your horizon. I challenge the industry to 1) further improve credit underwriting standards for real estate and consumer loans and raise your vantage point by looking at your processes with the lens of financial stability, 2) interact with your clients and raise your vantage point by enhancing your practices with the heart of consumer protection and financial education, and 3) increase lending to MSMEs and raise your vantage point by lending with the mind to create greater value. But much more can be done. As the old Board takes its place in CTB lore, your new Board is now at the helm to guide the industry forward. It is never an easy task to move forward but rest assured that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will be with you as we take that journey together into broader horizons. Thank you very much and good day to all of you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yaseen Anwar: Mobile banking in Pakistan Speech by Mr Yaseen Anwar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the 6th International Conference on “Mobile banking in Pakistan”, Karachi, 14 March 2013. *      *      * Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen I am indeed delighted to be here today at this Conference on mobile banking. I would like to congratulate the organizers for arranging this important conference, which has now become an annual event to showcase the developments, and measure the progress made by mobile banking in the country. Through these annual conferences, all of us have been identifying various challenges and finding new solutions, and thus transforming branchless banking into vibrant and innovative industry in Pakistan. Let me first briefly talk about the significance of Mobile Commerce and then move on to the mobile banking, its role in promoting financial inclusion, and our responsibilities to strengthen mobile banking in Pakistan. Mobile Commerce is generally characterized by a variety of business partnerships often involving a large number of organizations, from content providers to financial institutions to mobile network operators. After successful application of Mobile Commerce as an alternative channel for delivery of payment services in developed countries, the concept is now also taking roots in developing countries. The usage of innovative and unconventional channels will dominate the conventional means of business and communication, as evidenced by the high mobile phone subscription witnessed in Pakistan. The number of mobile phone subscribers has reached 120 million. Turning now to the use of mobile technology to promote financial access, there is an emerging consensus amongst policy makers around the world to improve access to financial services for poor people, through supporting the safe and sound spread of new modes of financial service delivery capable of reaching the poor. In Pakistan, Developments in branchless banking so far have been marvelous, leaving nobody in doubt about the potential of mobile phone banking to be a game-changer in banking, m-commerce, and financial inclusion. Broadly describing these recent developments, we have been witnessing transformation in customers’ needs and behaviors, increased competition, technological innovation, new business models, and regulatory proportionality. Owing to these developments, international development agencies and media have now been highlighting Pakistan for its market and institutional environment for branchless banking. In an article a few months back, The Financial Times counted branchless banking and microfinance initiatives in Pakistan among the “hidden forces of resilience offering the best hope for the country’s future”. Elaborating further, the article highlighted Pakistan “being in perpetual motion at the grassroots with ceaseless creativity as people find affordable solutions to their basic needs”. Regulatory approach has played a fundamental role in the development of branchless banking. The issuance of branchless banking regulations in 2008 was an outcome of SBP’s vision and strategy to develop a road map for financial inclusion through the use of mobile phone banking. With these regulations, SBP enabled a diverse set of players including banks, microfinance banks, mobile network operators (MNOs), retailers, and technology firms to develop partnerships and business models, while safeguarding stability of the banking and payment system, and interest of customers. In accordance with these objectives, SBP allowed only the bank-led model for undertaking branchless banking. At that time, many thought that this was a “restrictive” approach, and would not work out. They were proved wrong by the subsequent phenomenal growth of branchless banking in Pakistan. As 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  a result of our market developments, SBP’s regulatory approach and experience was cited as an example for other countries to follow. According to a recent CGAP publication, “Pakistan serves as an example of how public and private institutions together can move a country towards a digital financially inclusive system”. The report further notes that “Government and public actors have created the enabling environment and provided seed funding, while private actors are developing the infrastructure, services and a long-term business case”. Since the issuance of branchless banking regulations in 2008, several branchless banking models have been deployed. UBL’s Omni and Tameer bank’s EasyPaisa have already gained substantial ground and have established themselves as market leaders. Two new services (MobiCash and Timepey) have just launched while two are running live pilots. Moreover, all the four mobile network operators in partnership with some of the largest banks have already launched their branchless banking services or are at the final stages of launching. As a result, the branchless banking current growth trajectory is expected to get further steeper in the years ahead. With the entrance of new and strong players, branchless banking has already seen acceleration. The number of agent network servicing branchless banking customers has reached 42, 000. Therefore, the basic financial services can now be accessed in the remotest parts of the country through any of these agents. A total of 194 million transactions have been carried out worth 813 billion rupees. More than 2 million m-wallets have been opened till date, and these numbers will improve significantly. Along with the tremendous growth in the branchless banking sector, the infrastructure of payment systems and branch network is also showing an increasing growth trend. The ATMs network has increased to 6,232 whereas branch network has reached 11,600. 94 percent of our branches are now real time on-line. Similarly, the number of plastic cards has increased to 20 million and the number of POS machines has increased to 34,000 units. This is a significant achievement, and this also demonstrates the opportunity to bring the benefits of this infrastructure to millions of the unbanked population. Branchless Banking has also proved to be an effective instrument in channelizing the Government to Persons (G2P) payments in trying times like serving Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and devastating floods for the last two years. The Benazir Income Support Programme beneficiaries are also being served effectively through the same mechanism. In the coming days, this channel is expected to continue playing an important role towards the promotion of financial inclusion and the management of Government to Person (G2P) Programs like Salaries Disbursements, Pensions, BISP, Watan Cards, Pakistan Cards and tax collections services, etc. The existing Branchless Banking deployments can cater to the needs of over 10 million potential beneficiaries of G2P payments in Pakistan. Branchless banking is going to dominate the retail banking landscape in the long-term. Whilst we seek to encourage the introduction of innovative instruments for payments, we also need to ensure that high levels of standards are maintained for safety, security and protection of consumers’ interests. The central policy objectives of SBP are to ensure safety, soundness and efficiency of the banking system, and to protect the interest of consumers. Since branchless banking is becoming a vital component of the national payment grid, it is prudent for all stakeholders to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate inherent risks associated with it like access by un-authorized persons/ criminals such as hackers, money launderer, terrorist financiers etc. This can only be achieved when our technologies are robust and secured, and agents are comprehensively trained and effectively monitored by the banks. In this regard, the importance of a comprehensive agent development framework cannot be ignored. I am sure that our banks would not simply jump on the bandwagon without sufficient agent development mechanisms including their hiring, on-going training and monitoring. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Building public confidence on these innovative payment solutions is critical. A single failure of branchless banking deployment can erode the public’s confidence in the system which in turn may jeopardize the whole sector. Being fully cognizant of the risk factors involved in such unconventional modes of banking, SBP has been proactively monitoring developments and associated risks both at system and entity level in order to take appropriate corrective measures in a timely manner. We must acknowledge that branchless banking has gained critical mass in a short period of time. I believe that the market has to start shifting transactions from first generational services (Person-to-person/Bills payments) to second generational services (account-to-account and inter-bank transfer). The players need to expand their product portfolio by offering new products and services for their target market. In my view, this is part of an inevitable evolution which will ensure the long-term sustainable development of the sector, encourage micro savings and help in meeting the demands for inclusive financial services of the target market. Let me mention that SBP is working closely with key stakeholders of the mobile and branchless banking industry. We have already constituted a national consultative group and its various working groups to develop a common understanding on the challenges and develop a proposal for policy actions. SBP will continue its engagement with the stakeholders to identify and undertake all necessary measures for developing an eco-system that would not only support mobile banking but would also contribute to the wider economy. I trust that today’s conference will help us understand the various issues relating to the growth of mobile banking systems and products, and m-commerce. As this conference is meant to create awareness on mobile commerce, we understand that developments in m-banking and m-commerce will lead us to connect the unbanked segment of our population to financial services, thus contributing to their empowerment. Thank you all for being part of this forum and I look forward to your productive participation today. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: Total Impact – how regulation and crisis management will change the world’s financial landscape Speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Frankfurt Finance Summit, Frankfurt, 19 March 2013. *      *      * 1. Introduction Ladies and gentlemen I am delighted to conclude this year’s Frankfurt Finance Summit. For the third year in a row, this event has provided an excellent platform for an exchange of views between high-level experts from politics, academia, as well as the financial and the official sectors to discuss financial market issues of major current importance. Today’s conference has been asking about the total impact that regulation and crisis management will have on the financial landscape. The keynote speakers and panellists have given wide-ranging and, in some cases, diverging answers to that question. I am pleased to conclude this year’s summit by offering my views on some particular aspects of the issues discussed today. 2. Future of the European Monetary Union Let me start with the topic of the first panel this morning: the future of European Monetary Union. The crisis has highlighted shortcomings in the Union’s institutional framework. Let me remind you of three serious flaws. First, the deficit rules of the Stability and Growth Pact were not only circumvented by some member states, but deliberately bent. Second, member states’ borrowing was not effectively curbed because financial markets failed to exert a disciplining effect on public budgets. Third, contagion effects transmitted via member states’ financial systems were largely underestimated. The introduction of the single currency led to a greater integration of European financial markets. The highly integrated market increased the probability of contagion effects occurring via member states’ financial systems. Hence, it amplified the existing close link between risks stemming from a country’s public finances and the state of its banking system. These flaws were a major factor in the emergence of the sovereign debt crisis and that fact makes a good case for strengthening the institutional framework of the monetary union. I welcome the measures that have been initiated. The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and the agreement on the Fiscal Compact are major steps towards sounder budgetary policies. With the agreement on a European banking union, we have made further progress in one important specific area. A banking union can help to strengthen financial stability by loosening the nexus between banks and sovereigns. A European banking supervisor would benefit from the ability to make cross-border comparisons, for instance. Such a body should be able to monitor the build-up of excessive risks and pinpoint them more easily and at an earlier stage. A single supervisory mechanism should also overcome the national bias of supervisors. But a single supervisory mechanism is not sufficient. To shield banks from weak public finances, it must be accompanied by a sound regulatory underpinning. Such regulation should include upper limits for lending to governments and appropriate capital backing for sovereign bonds. Finally, a banking union should comprise a European resolution and 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  recovery mechanism to ensure that bank creditors – and not taxpayers – are the first in line to bear losses from a bank’s failure. Such a comprehensive banking union will be an important element of the new institutional framework of the monetary union. It will bring about significant changes not only for banks and their stakeholders, but also for regulators and supervisors with functions being transferred from the national to the European level. 3. Financial sector reforms Changes will also be made through financial sector reforms. The financial crisis has highlighted weaknesses in financial sector regulation. As a response to this, the G20 Heads of State or Government set in train a comprehensive reform agenda in November 2008. In the meantime, we have passed a number of major milestones on that agenda. But to make the international financial system as resilient and robust as it should be, we still have a long way to go. One of the most pressing issues is the implementation of Basel III. What is most worrying is that doubts about implementation have been voiced with respect to countries that are home to global financial centres and systemically important institutions. I consider it of utmost importance that all G20 countries live up to their self-commitment of leading by example. The initial implementation timelines have been modified in the EU and the US. We need to make sure that such delays do not lead to a watering down of the measures that we agreed upon internationally. Stricter banking regulation might set incentives to move business to less regulated entities. The regulation of the shadow banking system is therefore another pressing issue. Regular monitoring exercises help us to gain a better understanding of the kind and scale of business conducted outside the regulated banking system. But its actors and activities still remain largely unregulated. I consider it particularly important to deliver a final set of integrated recommendations on regulating the shadow banking system to the G20 in September. And it is absolutely crucial to finally solve the too-big-to-fail problem. However, we have to keep in mind that this term is not very precise. In many cases, institutions were not too big but actually too important to fail. Recent examples of nationalisations and repeated bail-outs of institutions in the Netherlands and France show that, ultimately, it is still the taxpayer who is at risk when banks are in trouble. We need to remove the implicit government subsidy for systemically important institutions and subject them to the ultimate sanction of the market. It must be possible to force banks to exit the market without destabilising the financial system. To make this threat credible, we have to restore a constitutive element of any functioning market economy: the principle of liability. The one who profits must also be the one to bear the losses. I consider the implementation of the internationally agreed framework for dealing with systemically important financial institutions as a top priority. Similarly, a “too big to fail” issue – but this time in the truest sense of the word – can also occur if the banking sector is too large in relation to the economy as a whole. The cases of Iceland, Ireland and Cyprus are good examples of this. The banking system in Cyprus is currently about 7 times the size of national GDP. By way of comparison, an average banking system in the monetary union is 3.5 times the size of national GDP. This problem has also been fuelled by the Cypriot business model of providing a low-tax environment. If the banking sector is too large, the national taxpayer will be unable to bear the costs. Consequently, European solidarity will be required to resolve the problems. This is comparable to the case of systemically important banks, which depend on the support of the taxpayer if the bank gets into difficulties. This is why the problem of banking sectors that are “too big to fail” also needs to be addressed one way or another. This could be achieved by downsizing the banking sector, as agreed at the meeting of the Euro Group. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  But let me get back to the current reform initiatives. They need to be fully and consistently implemented to enhance the resiliency of the financial sector. To ensure consistency, we need to focus even more on the systemic aspects of financial regulation. Regulatory measures must build upon each other and be interlocked to set consistent incentives. Otherwise, we run the risk of individual measures conflicting with each other. Such a lack of consistency might lessen the desired effects of the new regulations or even negate them entirely. Impact studies are an important tool in this context. To gauge the effects of new regulation, such studies should accompany all major reform projects. To avoid regulatory arbitrage, we must take into account the cross-border effects of regulation. The global financial system needs global rules. Accordingly, we need to ensure that internationally agreed measures are transposed into national laws and regulations in a timely and consistent manner. I strongly support the in-depth implementation monitoring by the Financial Stability Board and by international standard-setting bodies as essential tools for maintaining implementation pressure. Finally, the crisis has reminded us that containing systemic risk is vital for safeguarding financial stability. To mitigate and prevent systemic risks, macroprudential policy frameworks are being implemented in many countries, including Germany. Since the beginning of this year, the German Financial Stability Act has been in force. A Financial Stability Commission comprising representatives of the Bundesbank, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and the German Finance Ministry has been established. The Commission is in charge of designing consistent macroprudential policies and held its first meeting just yesterday. The institutional set-up is fairly advanced. Now, we need to deepen our understanding of the effects of macroprudential tools and operationalise their use. 4. Changes to the financial landscape Although financial sector reforms are not yet complete, it is already possible to see the impact of new regulation on the financial landscape. Some banks have fallen off the list of global systemically important banks because they have simplified their structure, downsized or de-risked their operations. This also includes a German bank. Several banks are de-emphasising high-profile but risky capital market business that benefited employees more than shareholders and society as a whole. The modified business models should ultimately result in a more resilient and diversified sector with a more sustainable risk-return profile. Further changes to banks’ business models will be brought about by structural measures. Concerns about institutions’ business conduct built the political case for such measures, including the ring-fencing or prohibition of certain activities. Corresponding recommendations have been made by Paul Volcker, John Vickers and Erkki Liikanen in the US, the UK, and the EU respectively. While the proposals differ in important details, they share the same general idea. Deposit-taking credit institutions should be shielded from the risks of speculative proprietary trading and high-risk lending. Such a separation of business lines can play a part in making the financial system more stable and resilient. But it is not a silver bullet. Ultimately, we should leave it to bank boards and management to decide what business model is best for the future. I appreciate that the German legislative proposal on introducing a ring-fence leaves some leeway in that regard. Finally, there is evidence that the corporate culture of banks is changing. Risk management, for example, has gained a more prominent role in the organisational structure of some banks. Efforts to strengthen risk governance have been undertaken as well, but further improvements are necessary. The manipulation of benchmark interest rates by traders is a case in point. Withholding or clawing back variable parts of remuneration packages of employees who were involved in such fraudulent activities can only be a first step. In the future, I expect to see further changes in institutions towards the promotion of sounder risk cultures. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Key issues in Asian financial markets Keynote address by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the ACI (The Financial Markets Association) 52nd World Congress, Singapore, 15 March 2013. *      *      * Mr. Manfred Wiebogen, ACI Global President  Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen  1. I am delighted to be here today with all of you.  2. The last time Singapore hosted the ACI Congress was back in 2001. In fact, it was just before 9/11. The world was in a very different place. Asia too was so different from today. The wounds of the Asian crisis of the late 90s were still fresh. Investor confidence in the various countries in the region was uneven. And Asian capital markets were by and large in their infancy.  The new financial landscape 3. We are now in a new phase in global finance. Global finance is deleveraging, after the great credit bubble that began more than a decade ago and came to an end in 2007. But deleveraging still has some way to go, and some years to go, before the overall level of leverage relative to economic activity gets back to a sustainable level. 4. The pace of deleveraging has been moderated so far by central banks, who have taken onto their balance sheets unprecedented levels of both public and private sector debt. Their actions have reduced the risks of catastrophe. But it also means we have a long way yet to go in reducing debts and returning to sustainable growth.  5. We are also seeing important shifts in the structure of global finance, besides the gradual contraction in global liquidity. It is too early to say where we will be five years from now, but some of the broad brush-strokes in this new landscape of global finance are already with us and likely to stay:  • The return on equity in global banking has fallen, and will not return to pre-crisis levels, given stricter capital and liquidity rules.  • Deposits have become more important as a source of bank funding.  • Banks in certain major jurisdictions have retreated from global markets, and worryingly, and may stay in retreat for some time.  • The securitised debt markets should recover, but with less leverage underpinning them, and hopefully greater risk transparency.  • In the derivative markets, there will be greater standardisation of products, and much greater reliance on common market infrastructure – for trading, clearing and reporting of trades. High volume, low-margin platforms will likely gain in competitiveness.  • Wealth management will remain a growth industry, especially in Asia, where the pool of wealth is growing most rapidly and the need for diversification remains great.  • And outside of intermediated finance, companies will seek new ways of raising funds, including through private placements. 6. Will this mean a safer financial world? Maybe. That will depend on whether we persist in seeing through the regulatory reforms that began a few years ago. It will depend on 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  whether we keep to a sensible balance in regulation – and that includes not over-doing bank regulation and under-doing the oversight of shadow banking. It will also depend on whether we all stay intensely alert to the risks of the future, including especially the risks that we do not yet see or know, rather than focus only on the last battle or on preventing the last crisis from recurring.  7. What of global capital flows? There too we see shifts, as global finance responds to a two-track world of economic growth. The prospect of sub-par growth in the advanced economies for a number of years, together with central bank actions to keep interest rates very low, have led to what is becoming a furious search for yield. Pension funds and insurance funds need better yields badly, and they are putting more monies in the emerging markets and other risk assets.  8. This is likely to be more than a cyclical trend. We are seeing a secular shift in assets towards the emerging markets. Advanced country funds in fact remain significantly underweighted in emerging market assets, and are gradually correcting for this. At the same time, sovereign debt ratings have been raised in several emerging economies, in Asia especially1, at the same time that a number of advanced economies2 have seen their ratings lowered. Asia is certainly not free from risks, and there is much work ahead to preserve and improve sovereign ratings. But no one can assume that the recent rebalancing of risk assessments vis-à-vis the advanced economies is temporary.  9 What this continuing shift in global funds also means, however, is that there is critical need to add depth and breadth to Asian financial markets. It will not be possible to absorb a greater share of global savings without developing this depth and breadth in markets, and a robust market infrastructure. Otherwise, both global and Asian capital flows within the region will lead to recurrent bubbles, whether in equities, property markets or currencies, rather than find their way to the most productive investments in Asia’s economies.  10. Asia’s financial markets have grown significantly over the past decade. But the capital markets, and especially for bonds and securitised debts, remain small in relation to Asia’s GDP. Further, the region’s financial markets are still relatively small and fragmented.  11. There is by the same virtue, great potential to develop Asian financial markets and enable them to play a stronger role in promoting balanced and sustainable growth.  12. We will have to push ahead with reforms at two levels to develop these financial markets. Gradual and progressive financial liberalisation can bring about more liquid and broader domestic financial markets. It will also help spur domestic demand by households, and provide smaller enterprises with better access to capital in several Asian economies. Secondly, at the regional level, we have to inject greater momentum into improving cross-border market access and harmonising rules and standards. Key themes in the development of Asia’s financial markets  13. Let me now touch on three themes that will influence the development of Asia’s financial markets in the decade ahead:  i. Firstly, the changes in the OTC derivatives markets as a result of global reforms;  ii. Secondly, the harnessing of technology to transform Asia’s financial infrastructure; and iii. Thirdly, the increasing international role of the RMB.                                                 1 For example, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. 2 Namely the US, Japan, France, peripheral Europe. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  I. Structural shifts in the OTC derivatives markets as a result of global reforms  14. First, the structural shift in the global OTC derivatives markets. Most of you will be familiar with the changes that are coming into place, in steps, as a result of global reforms – more standardised products, and more robust market infrastructure: central counterparties for clearing, trade repositories for reporting, swap execution facilities for trading where appropriate. The global reform process is now shifting from rulemaking to implementation.  15. We are already seeing the shift in Asia’s OTC derivative markets. The new market infrastructures are expected to provide greater transparency and allow risks to be managed more effectively among market participants. Market practices will be redefined, with the need to report and clear selected OTC derivative trades within more than one jurisdictions.  16. However, we are also seeing a proliferation of Central Counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories being set up in Asia. While this will provide choice to Asian market participants, it may also increase risk and lead to higher costs.  17. Regulators will need a comprehensive view of risks in the cross-border, interconnected market. Having multiple CCPs and trade repositories in the region may risk fragmentation, and may hamper monitoring of systemic risks as regulators may see only their own segments of the market. Market participants will also face additional costs if CCPs and trade repositories lack economies of scale. 18. Asian regulators will therefore need to work closely together to enable infrastructural entities to offer their services across different jurisdictions. For example, the infrastructure of a DTCC global trade repository and AsiaClear CCP in Singapore offers the prospect of effective surveillance by regional regulators and economies of scale. We will continue to ensure that our market infrastructure operates in a transparent and accessible way so that the needs of regional regulators and the industry can be met under clear and robust guidelines.  19. At the global level too, there are real benefits for regulators to ensure inter-operability in market infrastructure to allow for more effective risk monitoring. However, inter-operability will require time and effort, as risk management practices such as margin eligibility standards have to be harmonised across CCPs in different jurisdictions.  20. As Asia’s infrastructure is still at an early stage of development, we have an opportunity to harmonise practices while making the changes needed to respond to emerging global regulatory reforms. It is heartening to note that Asian regulators are working closely on OTC derivatives regulations. A good example was the joint letter from Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia to the US CFTC, expressing our concerns on the extra-territorial application of the US rules.  II. Harnessing technology to transform Asia’s financial infrastructure in a game-changing fashion  21. Regulators everywhere are confronted with highly connected global markets. Collecting and managing information is now a core competence in itself, for effective surveillance of the financial markets. Similarly, market participants are making greater use of technology in risk management – performing complex portfolio valuation and mitigating risks such as through intra-day margining at CCPs, and often across global books and in multiple time zones and jurisdictions. Moving collateral across markets swiftly and efficiently is also now a core competence. 22. Besides risk management, technology can be useful in developing liquidity in Asian markets. It can bring greater pricing efficiency and transparency, as we are seeing in the US and EU financial markets as trading moves to electronic platforms. 23. In Asia, there is room for our financial markets to embrace greater “electronification” of trading, notwithstanding our smaller markets. To illustrate, an estimated 80% of trades are 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  executed in electronic platforms in developed country FX markets, whereas 85% of FX trades in Asia are still executed by voice. A reduction in transaction costs can promote greater liquidity for Asian asset classes, and broaden participation from investors including retail traders. III. Growing regional and international role of the RMB 24. Let me go on to the third theme I wanted to talk about, which is that of RMB internationalisation, and how this will shape Asia’s financial markets development.  25. The status quo will not last. Currently, only 0.6% of global payments are settled in RMB, vastly below China’s share of global trade (10%) or investment flows. There is clearly room for growth.  26. In the long run, if we envisage China with deep and liquid capital markets, and a largely liberalised capital account, the RMB market will potentially play a transformational role in Asian finance. For now, even with limited convertibility, there is considerable potential for greater use of the RMB. The economic fundamentals are driving this. Besides China’s growing share of global trade, there is a rapidly growing trade between China and the rest of the Asian region, and especially ASEAN. Further, China’s foreign direct investments are expanding strongly, especially into Asian markets. Outbound Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from China has increased almost seven-fold in the last seven years (to US$77 billion in 20123), and is expected to expand further in the coming decade. A growing part of this FDI is expected to be RMB-denominated, and this too will contribute to greater offshore use of the RMB.  27. The overseas expansion of Chinese corporates will be reinforced by the growing presence of mainland Chinese banks as they grow their regional and international presence. In Singapore, we extended Qualifying Full Bank (QFB) privileges to Bank of China and ICBC as part of the China-Singapore FTA. Both banks are growing their Singapore operations as Southeast Asian hubs. We are also seeing interest from other Chinese financial institutions. 28. The re-denomination of China’s trading flows in RMB will allow Asian corporate and financial institutions to more effectively manage their exposures to China. While USD would remain an integral global settlement currency, RMB is likely to be increasingly used for trade denomination and contract pricing.  29. As we see greater acceptance and use of the RMB as a trade settlement currency, there will also be important implications for the interactions between China and Asia’s financial markets, and indeed for global financial markets.  30. For one, it will be critical to facilitate the development of a single fungible offshore RMB market, as the market grows in multiple jurisdictions. (Currently, the industry has designated different currency codes, such as the CNH and CNT, to reflect these existing market frictions.) Regulators and market participants will have to work together to avoid fragmenting liquidity across markets, and to promote efficiency in the offshore RMB market. 31. In addition, China plans to launch its international payment system, known as CIPS, in 2014. The development of a single centralised cross-border RMB payments infrastructure also augurs well for market efficiency and standardised practices for RMB payments across the region.                                                  3 CNBC, 17 Jan 2013. “China’s outbound investment leaps to record high in December”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Singapore’s role as an offshore RMB market 32. As an international trading and financial centre, Singapore will seek to support the growth of a resilient offshore RMB market in the Asian region by: i. Building RMB liquidity; ii. Enhancing access to RMB for funding and investment purposes; and iii. Integrating the offshore RMB with existing Asian local currency markets. 33. Firstly, Singapore can leverage on its strengths as a key wholesale funding centre to increase liquidity and circulation of the RMB in Asia. We are already seeing good growth in RMB deposits, both non-bank and interbank. We are also one of the largest centres for RMB payments outside Hong Kong. As a major regional funding centre, Singapore has traditionally supported the liquidity of the Asian markets and can partner China in promoting sustainable offshore use of the RMB.  34. In February this year, ICBC Singapore was appointed by the People’s Bank of China (PBC) as the RMB clearing bank in Singapore. The RMB clearing bank will be an important channel for RMB liquidity to circulate between China to Singapore.  35. In addition, PBC and MAS together announced an expanded Currency Swap Facility last Friday. This will see a doubling in the size of the swap facility from RMB150 to RMB300 billion. The scope of the Currency Swap Facility will also be expanded to allow MAS to provide RMB liquidity to banks in Singapore, where needed. This backstop facility will further strengthen confidence in Singapore’s offshore RMB market, and encourage more financial institutions, corporates, and investors to step forward and participate in the RMB market via Singapore.  36. Secondly, with a strong RMB pool, Singapore can provide enhanced access to RMB funding for corporates and investors. Singapore is a major source of FDI to China and serves as the Asia-Pacific headquarters for many multinational companies (MNCs) and Asian corporates with operations in China. We also serve as the regional treasury centre for a large base of Chinese corporates. 37. With the new RMB clearing arrangements, we can expect financial institutions based in Singapore to reach out to local and regional corporate and investors and encourage greater participation in the offshore RMB market.  38 Thirdly, Singapore can support the integration of offshore RMB with Asian local currency markets and act as a test-bed for new RMB products. The development of a wider range of RMB products will be healthy. It will create additional ways in which corporates can redeploy their RMB funds in the offshore markets, and provide additional products for investment.  39. The financial industry in Singapore has good expertise in developing FX and derivatives instruments, with several emerging Asian FX teams based here. It is well equipped to develop customised offshore RMB capital market instruments, especially for Asian market participants. For instance, banks in Singapore can explore how to encourage offshore RMB bond issuance in Singapore with longer maturity tenors and different issuer profiles.  Conclusion 40. Let me wrap up briefly. Global deleveraging is being accompanied by the continued inflow of funds into Asia’s emerging market economies. This shift poses risks if not well-managed, but it is also an opportunity. The next phase of development in Asia’s financial markets is therefore critical. We have to develop greater breadth and breadth in Asian markets, so that savings flows translate into sustainable economic growth rather than recurrent bubbles in asset markets.  41. Thank you and I wish you a successful conference. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Philip Lowe: Internal balance, structural change and monetary policy Address by Mr Philip Lowe, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian Industry Group 13th Annual Economics Forum, Sydney, 19 March 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank David Orsmond for valuable assistance in the preparation of this talk. It is a pleasure to participate again in the Australian Industry Group’s Annual Economics Forum. This is the fourth time I have participated in this Forum, having spoken in 2010, 2011, 2012 and now 2013. Over this period, the Australian economy has undergone very significant adjustment. My central message today is that, overall, this adjustment has proceeded pretty well, particularly in light of the extraordinary developments that have occurred in the global economy over these years. This message is not meant to downplay the disruptive and sometimes painful effects of the changes that are taking place. At the Reserve Bank, we have spent much time trying to understand the stresses and strains facing parts of the economy as a result of structural change. But we have also spent time trying to understand the benefits that can come from this change, including an increase in our average living standards and higher productivity. From an overall perspective, it is important that we do not lose sight of what has been achieved in Australia. We have managed to maintain a fair degree of internal balance during a period in which there has been considerable structural change, a very large shift in world relative prices, a major boom in investment and a financial crisis in many of the North Atlantic economies. Our economic performance has been much better than many other countries and we remain well placed to benefit from the shift of economic weight towards the emerging market economies, particularly those in Asia. While I understand that many companies face challenges, we should not lose sight of this bigger picture – a picture I suspect that many other countries wish they shared. Internal balance and structural change I would like to begin this morning by briefly summarising the broad economic outcomes in Australia since I first spoke at this Forum in March 2010. Since that time, output in the Australian economy has increased by 9 per cent. The number of people with jobs has risen by over half a million. The unemployment rate today, at 5.4 per cent, is exactly the same as it was three years ago. And underlying inflation has averaged 2½ per cent over this period, which is the midpoint of the medium-term inflation target. So over these three years we have seen growth close to trend, a stable and relatively low unemployment rate and inflation at target. By the standards of most other countries, this represents a very good outcome and a high degree of internal balance. Remarkably, we have achieved this balance despite experiencing the biggest boom in business investment and the largest rise in the terms of trade for over a hundred years (Graph 1). In the past, much smaller investment and terms of trade booms caused outbreaks of inflation and the emergence of other imbalances in the economy. On this occasion this has not happened. The investment boom has not led to a large increase in the current account deficit. There has not been an explosion in credit. Increases in asset prices have generally been contained. And the average level of interest rates has been below the long-term average, despite the very significant additional demand generated by the record levels of investment and the terms of trade. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Graph 1  There are a number of factors that are important to understanding how domestic or internal balance has been maintained, with generally low interest rates, despite the very large shocks experienced by the Australian economy. This morning, I would like to focus on just two of these. The first is the flexible exchange rate. The high levels of investment and commodity prices have been associated with a high value of the Australian dollar. This has clearly caused some difficulties for parts of our economy, including the manufacturing, tourism and education sectors. But from an overall macroeconomic perspective, the appreciation of the exchange rate has played an important stabilising role. Had we not experienced the sizeable appreciation over recent years, it is highly likely that the economy would have overheated and that we would have had substantially higher inflation and substantially higher interest rates. This would not have been in the interests of the community at large or, I might add, in the interests of the sectors currently being adversely affected by the high exchange rate. It is also worth adding that, in any case, it is unlikely that we would have avoided a substantial real exchange rate appreciation, with it coming through the more costly route of higher inflation. This, of course, does not mean that, at each and every point in time, the exchange rate is at its ideal rate from a domestic balance perspective. We should not forget that exchange rates are relative prices between two countries’ moneys. This means that they are determined both by what is happening domestically and by what is happening abroad. This has been obvious over recent years, with the very accommodative monetary conditions in many of the developed economies tending to put downward pressure on the value of their currencies, including relative to the Australian dollar. As we have said a number of times, the Reserve Bank has responded to this development by lowering the cash rate. It is also worth repeating that this lowering of the cash rate has not been with the direct intention of achieving a lower exchange rate, but rather with the intention of offsetting some of the contractionary effects on the Australian economy of the high value of the Australian dollar. Over recent times, our extensive discussions with Australian businesses confirm that they are adjusting to the high value of the currency. When I spoke at this Forum in 2010 and 2011 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  my sense was that many businesses were hoping that the high exchange rate was just a temporary development, that it would pass, and that business models wouldn’t have to change too much. Today, I have quite a different sense. Nowadays, there is a greater recognition that the high exchange rate is likely to be quite persistent and firms, including in the manufacturing sector, are adjusting to this. Many are looking to improve their internal processes and address inefficiencies. They are focusing on products where value added is highest and where the quality of the workforce is a strategic advantage. We hear from businesses right across the country that they are looking for improvements and that many are finding them. This adjustment in business processes and models is often painful. But the fact that it is occurring is one reason why the Reserve Bank has been tentatively optimistic for some time that productivity growth would pick-up from the low rates experienced over much of the previous decade. We are now seeing some tentative evidence of this in the aggregate productivity data (Graph 2). While these data tend to be volatile from year to year and subject to sizeable revisions, productivity growth in 2012 was better than it has been for quite some time. Of course, we cannot be sure that this will continue, but the structural changes that are now occurring mean that there are reasonable prospects for a sustained lift in productivity growth. Graph 2  We can also see evidence of adjustment in the detailed industry data, including in the manufacturing sector. While there has been little net growth in either aggregate output or exports from the manufacturing sector for some years, some parts of the industry have done quite well. Output of machinery and equipment and of metals have both trended higher over recent years, and exports of specialised mining-related and other machinery have increased, as have exports in some other categories (Graph 3). Many of these are areas where Australia does have a comparative advantage and where value added is high. It is by focusing on these comparative advantages that we can best build a strong and successful manufacturing sector, while at the same time living with a high exchange rate. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Graph 3  I would now like to turn to the second broad factor that has helped maintain domestic balance during the once-in-a-century investment boom. And that is the increase in household saving. Since the mid 2000s, the household sector net saving ratio has risen from around zero to around 10 per cent (Graph 4). In today’s money this represents about an additional $90 billion that is saved, not spent, by households each year. Graph 4  Now I know that this increase in household savings has not been universally welcomed by the retail sector. It has caused difficulties for some businesses, including those that based their business models on a continuation of the earlier trends. But consider how the economy might have looked over the past few years had households spent an extra $90 billion each 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  year. It is likely that there would have been significant overheating. The exchange rate would have been higher. There would have been more borrowing from the rest of the world. And both inflation and interest rates would have been higher. I suggest that these are not developments that would have been warmly welcomed by most in the community. So, somewhat ironically, two of the factors that have created difficult challenges for many businesses over recent years – the high exchange rate and increased household savings – are the very same factors that have been critical to Australia’s good macroeconomic performance. Importantly, these factors have helped Australia to digest a huge investment boom without generating substantial imbalances in the economy. At the same time, these factors have prompted significant structural change which, while difficult, is critical to achieving higher overall productivity and higher living standards. There is clearly a lot of change going on in the Australian economy at the moment. How you view this change depends critically upon where you stand. However, no matter what one’s perspective, we should not lose sight of the fact that maintaining overall macro balance through this period of change has been a significant achievement. And it is an achievement that has benefited the entire community. The contribution of monetary policy So far I have discussed structural factors, but monetary policy has also played some role in helping maintain this overall internal balance. In particular, Australia’s credible medium-term inflation targeting framework has served us well through this period of change. It is important though to point out that monetary policy cannot make the various global factors driving our economy go away. Monetary policy cannot, nor should it attempt to, prevent structural change from occurring. What we can do is deal as best we can with the hand that the global economy has dealt us. We can help ensure that aggregate demand and supply remain in broad balance, so that when firms are making employment, investment and production decisions they can do so with reasonable confidence about the health of the overall economy. Importantly, we can ensure that inflation remains low and stable so that uncertainty about the overall level of prices is not added to the list of things that the community has to worry about. Since November 2011, the Board of the Reserve Bank has lowered the cash rate six times, by a cumulative 1¾ percentage points. These reductions have brought the cash rate down to 3 per cent, which is equal to the lowest level on record. Lending rates have also come down substantially, although a number are still above earlier lows given the general rise in bank funding costs that has occurred since the global financial crisis. Recently, there has been some discussion as to whether these low rates are actually working. This type of discussion is not surprising given that there are lags between when monetary policy is changed and when the full effect is felt in the economy. It is not a matter of simply changing interest rates today and seeing an immediate response tomorrow. Another complication is that the environment in which interest rates are being adjusted is not the same from one interest rate phase to the next. As a result, the exact way that movements in interest rates are transmitted to the economy can change over time. All this means that, as always, we need to monitor things very closely. At the moment though, the available evidence does suggest that lower interest rates are doing their work broadly as expected. In general, the initial responses to a loosening of monetary policy would be expected to include stronger asset prices, improved conditions in the housing market, a lift in consumer confidence and a lower exchange rate. Much of this does appear to be occurring. Nationwide measures of house prices have increased by around 4 per cent since mid last year, after having declined for around 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  18 months. Home lending approvals and auction clearance rates have both risen. Equity prices are up over 20 per cent since the middle of last year. And the level of consumer confidence is now well above its long-run average level (Graph 5). Despite what one often hears, households do appear to be feeling better about both their finances as well as Australia’s medium-term prospects. Graph 5  The one notable exception to the expected responses following a substantial easing of monetary policy is that there has been little movement in the exchange rate. However, this reflects the global factors that I talked about earlier, and the Reserve Bank has attempted to calibrate the setting of monetary policy to take account of this. Now, if the monetary transmission mechanism works broadly as it has in the past, then an improvement in consumer sentiment and higher asset prices should feed through, in time, to higher spending by households. There are some signs, albeit still tentative, that this is beginning to occur. ABS data and the Bank’s liaison suggest slightly firmer retail spending over recent months than over the second part of last year, though conditions remain mixed across the industry. There are also signs of a pick-up in the forward indicators for new dwelling construction across many areas of the country. In addition, a number of labour market indicators, after having softened last year, have had a slightly firmer tone of late. Another critical element in the monetary transmission process is a pick-up in private business investment. This is often the last link in the chain, and typically follows increased confidence and higher spending. Given the nature of the investment boom we are currently experiencing, it is non-mining investment where we are looking for this pick-up to occur. As mining investment inevitably peaks and then gradually declines, a critical question for the outlook is the strength of this expected pick-up in non-mining investment. We cannot know the answer to this question yet. What we do know is that other parts of the transmission mechanism appear to be working broadly in line with our expectations and that there are some tentative signs of a lift in investment intentions outside the resources sector. The most noteworthy of these was the capital expenditure data published by the ABS a few weeks back, which show that firms expected to increase spending on non-mining construction and on machinery and equipment investment in the next financial year. Whether the increases will be sufficient to offset the expected lower levels of mining investment is something that we will be watching very carefully over the months ahead. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  So let me conclude by restating the main message that I started with – that is, that the Australian economy has adjusted pretty well to some very large shocks in the global economy over recent years. We have been able to maintain a high degree of internal balance, while at the same time accommodating significant change in the structure of the economy. Businesses right across the spectrum, including in the manufacturing sector, are adjusting to the new realities. This adjustment is often difficult, but it does hold out the prospect of higher productivity and higher living standards. Monetary policy has played an important supporting role in this adjustment by keeping inflation low and stable and the Reserve Bank of Australia is committed to continuing to play that role. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Takahide Kiuchi: Recent developments in economic activity and prices and future monetary policy Speech by Mr Takahide Kiuchi, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Kanagawa, 28 February 2013. *      *      * I. Current situation of overseas economies and their prospects for a moderate recovery  A. Easing of tension in global financial markets  I would like to start my speech with a look at overseas economies. Developments in global financial markets continue to require vigilance, especially in terms of the European debt problem and the fiscal problem in the United States. Nevertheless, tension in the financial markets has eased significantly since around autumn 2012, as evidenced by the repurchasing of risk assets such as currencies of emerging economies and stocks and the selling of advanced economies’ government bonds and the yen, which had been purchased as a safe currency. Three things seem to be at work in the background to these developments. First, in Europe and the United States, a decline has occurred in tail risks – risks with a low probability of materialization but a devastating impact if they materialize. This reflects the fact that in Europe the possibility of disintegration of the euro has fallen significantly, supported by (1) the approval of new disbursement of financial assistance to Greece, (2) some progress achieved in fiscal consolidation and economic structural reforms by peripheral European countries such as Portugal and Spain, and (3) the introduction of safety valves such as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). In addition, at the beginning of 2013 the United States avoided the “fiscal cliff,” a state in which the expiration of large-scale tax cuts and substantial fiscal spending cuts threatened to occur simultaneously. Second, investors’ confidence has returned due to expectations regarding policy measures, as central banks in advanced economies such as the United States and Europe as well as Japan have conducted aggressive monetary easing. Third, expectations have grown that the global economy will pick up, as the U.S. and Chinese economies have firmed since autumn 2012.  B. Gradual pick-up in overseas economies from a deceleration phase  While overseas economies remain in a deceleration phase as a whole, signs of a pick-up have been observed. The U.S. economy has been on a moderate recovery trend. Business sentiment that had been cautious due to concerns over the fiscal cliff has improved somewhat, and business fixed investment has shown signs of a pick-up. In the household sector, firmness in housing investment and car purchases has become pronounced partly due to the effects of the decline in long-term interest rates. As for the outlook, the recovery trend in the U.S. economy is likely to gradually strengthen in the latter half of 2013, as the effects of expiration of tax cuts wane and uncertainties diminish in regard to fiscal spending cuts and the debt ceiling problem.  Economic activity in the euro area remains weak. From the latter half of 2013, however, economic activity is likely to gradually recover particularly in core countries such as Germany and France. This is because (1) disturbances in financial markets have been diminishing; (2) the degree of fiscal austerity, while continuing, has eased somewhat; and (3) the competitiveness of peripheral countries’ exports has begun to recover with the progress in structural reforms, including reductions in labor costs.  The Chinese economy has been generally picking up since autumn 2012, as the government’s expansionary fiscal measures centered primarily on infrastructure investment and monetary easing measures have been producing positive effects. The real GDP growth 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  rate in the January-March quarter of 2013 is expected to recover to the 8.0–9.0 percent level for the first time in a year.  In these circumstances, looking at the outlook for the global economy as a whole, the real GDP growth rate is expected to accelerate moderately from 3.2 percent in 2012 to 3.5 percent in 2013 and 4.1 percent in 2014, according to the latest World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in January 2013. If the global economy – led by emerging economies – registers growth rates as projected, the rates will be above the historical long-term average.  II. Current situation of Japan’s economy and its prospects, with the key factor of a pick-up in overseas economies  A. Leveling out of Japan’s economy  Japan’s economy remained relatively weak during the latter half of 2012, as exports and production decreased significantly due mainly to the deceleration in overseas economies, which in turn adversely affected domestic demand such as business fixed investment in the manufacturing industry. However, recent developments show that the pace of decrease in exports has been moderating and production appears to have stopped decreasing. Based on these developments, at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held on February 13 and 14, 2013, the Bank of Japan revised upward its basic assessment of the domestic economy, from an assessment that the economy remained relatively weak to an assessment that it appeared to have stopped weakening.  The leveling out of production is mainly attributable to three factors. First, the effects of the ending of subsidies for purchasing energy-efficient cars, which temporarily exerted strong downward pressure on car production, have fallen off. Second, the effects of the recent developments in the relations between Japan and China, which dealt a serious blow particularly to exports of cars and related items, have eased somewhat. And third, the pace of decrease in exports has been moderating as overseas economies such as the United States and China have shown some signs of picking up. Nevertheless, while exports are showing some signs of leveling out, it is necessary to closely monitor whether a clear increase will occur in exports, which are expected to become the driving force of a full-fledged economic recovery. Consequently, uncertainty remains over how Japan’s economy will achieve a full-fledged recovery.  B. Effects of fiscal policy measures, the depreciation of the yen, and the rise in stock prices  Japan’s growth rate for 2013 is expected to rise relatively steadily, in line with the accumulation of temporary boosting effects of various policy measures. First, the implementation of the supplementary budget for fiscal 2012 of about 20 trillion yen is expected to have an effect, particularly in public investment, from the April-June quarter of 2013 onward. Second, the recent developments in foreign exchange rates and stock prices – supported in part by expectations for the new administration’s economic and fiscal policies as well as for the Bank’s enhancement of monetary easing – are expected to gradually have positive effects mainly in exports and private consumption. Third, a front-loaded increase in demand prior to the hike in the consumption tax scheduled in April 2014 is likely to take place particularly in demand for housing and durable consumer goods.  According to the median of the forecasts of the majority of the Bank’s Policy Board members in the interim assessment of the October 2012 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, released in January 2013, the real GDP growth rate is expected to be 1.0 percent for fiscal 2012, accelerate to 2.3 percent for fiscal 2013, and decline to 0.8 percent for fiscal 2014 even after accounting for the effects of the consumption tax hike. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food is expected to rise 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  gradually reflecting an improvement in the output gap as a result of the economic growth rate continuing to exceed the potential growth rate. As for the median of the forecasts, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is projected to be minus 0.2 percent for fiscal 2012, 0.4 percent for fiscal 2013, and 0.9 percent for fiscal 2014 excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike. Meanwhile, with regard to risk factors, attention should be paid to the prospects for the European debt problem, the momentum toward recovery for the U.S. economy, the possibility of emerging and commodity-exporting economies making a smooth transition to a sustainable growth path, and the effects of the recent developments in the relations between Japan and China. With these factors taken into consideration, a high degree of uncertainty remains concerning Japan’s economy.  III. Downside risks to the economic outlook  A. Weak recovery of overseas economies  With respect to the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity and prices in Japan, I consider the downside risks to be rather large.  The greatest concern arises from the possibility of the deceleration in overseas economies. Although overseas economies are likely to gradually emerge from their current deceleration phase, the sustainability of their recovery will likely remain unpredictable. In the United States, housing investment and private consumption are expected to be the driving force of the pick-up in the economy in the short run; if the recent uptrend in long-term interest rates strengthens suddenly, however, this could adversely affect funding for housing investment and car purchases. Attention should also be paid to the risk that the persisting uncertainty over fiscal policy could exert downward pressure on the U.S. economy with an influence on public sentiment.  With regard to the euro area, it is necessary to remain continually vigilant against the risk that financial markets could suffer renewed disturbance if political and social instability hinders fiscal consolidation and economic structural reforms and if slow progress in coordinating national interests hampers Europe’s ongoing integration such as the formation of fiscal and banking union. In addition, since banks’ lending attitudes have not shown signs of easing, there is a risk that funding constraints could prevent the economy from emerging from the deceleration phase for a long time.  As for China, the government’s policy stance is the focus of attention. Because aggressive fiscal measures adopted after the Lehman shock left many issues unresolved – such as excessive capital stock and an overheating in the real estate market – China’s previous administration had remained cautious about public spending despite a decelerating economy. The current administration also appears to be maintaining a cautious stance. In addition, the Chinese government remains vigilant against (1) a rise in the inflation rate, (2) an upturn in major cities’ housing prices, which the previous administration had sought to contain, and (3) a rapid expansion in shadow banking such as trust business, where personal assets are flowing in to gain high returns. The possibility should therefore not be ruled out that the government will reverse its accommodative stance on fiscal policy. In terms of monetary policy, the People’s Bank of China has indicated its intention of placing top priority on controlling inflation. Moreover, in response to the expansion in bank lending in January 2013, the authorities have reportedly instructed large banks to constrain lending. The authorities have stated their intention of strengthening risk management associated with shadow banking, in which case there is a risk that infrastructure investment and real estate investment will be significantly suppressed.  B. Continuation of a large negative output gap in the major economies Aside from the short-term downside risks I have mentioned, there is concern over the medium to long term: it could take time before the U.S. and European economies, as well as 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the Chinese economy, overcome the aftereffects of the credit bubble. Similar to what occurred in Japan, firms will likely continue their cautious stance on employment and households’ medium- to long-term income expectations are likely to weaken in view of the persistently high unemployment rate, causing the economies to lag behind in achieving a self-sustaining recovery with an expansion of employment and income. What I wish to highlight here is that since the Lehman shock, the output gap – which indicates the aggregate demand and supply balance – has been largely negative across the advanced economies. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the output gap in the advanced economies, after having reached minus 4.0 percent of GDP in 2009, is expected to exceed minus 3.0 percent in 2013, at minus 3.3 percent. In the OECD’s projections for the output gap as of November 2012, the output gap of Japan is minus 2.1 percent for 2013, but that of the United States and of the euro area is substantially more negative.  The large negative output gap in the advanced economies indicates a prolonged excess in production capacity and labor in the aftermath of the credit bubble, appearing in the form of balance-sheet adjustments. This type of situation causes firms to post lower profits and further restrain investment, and causes households to lower their income expectations and restrain consumption, exerting downward pressure on the already-declining inflation rate. With this situation spreading widely in the major economies, which are Japan’s main export destinations, considerable uncertainty will inevitably remain over Japan’s export environment in the long run.  C. Expansion of trade deficit and financial market stability  With regard to the downside risks to Japan’s economy, due attention should be paid to the continued trend in the expansion of trade deficit and its effects on financial markets. As I mentioned, Japan’s economic growth rate is expected to rise relatively smoothly for the time being, but the recovery of overseas economies could lack momentum. In addition, imports of raw materials are expected to remain at a high level. This situation could cause Japan’s trade deficit to expand. An expansion of the trade deficit causes the yen to depreciate mainly through changes in the supply-demand balance in foreign exchange markets. This could then destabilize financial markets, because not only a buoyant economy and a rise in import prices but also a reduction in surplus funds in the domestic markets cause long-term interest rates to rise. Attention should therefore be paid to the effects of the expansion of trade deficit on financial markets as well as economic activity.  Furthermore, long-term interest rates could rise if credibility of the conduct of fiscal policy is undermined. The rise in long-term interest rates could significantly affect Japan’s economy, and depending on the degree of the rise, could also affect the economy by greatly aggravating instability in the banking system. Long-term interest rates in Japan have been stable so far, and this may be regarded as evidence that the credibility of fiscal policy is being maintained. However, given that unexpected events may trigger sudden and nonlinear changes in market sentiment, as experienced with the European debt problem, it is necessary to continue careful monitoring to identify the changes as risk factors.  IV. Developments in prices and wages in Japan and their characteristics  Before I move onto my next topic of monetary policy conduct, I would like to discuss developments in prices and wages in Japan, which are closely linked to my topic, and give my personal view on the background to the prolonged deflation.  A. Historical developments in Japan’s inflation rate and a comparison with other major economies  Since the 1980s, Japan’s inflation rate has remained at a consistently low level, unlike the case of other major economies. According to the OECD, during the decade from 1985 to 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  1995, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI in the G-7 countries was 3.3 percent on average, while in Japan it was 1.4 percent. For the 15 years thereafter, from 1996 to 2011, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI in the G-7 countries was 1.9 percent on average, while in Japan it was minus 0.1 percent. The difference between the averages of Japan’s inflation rate and those of the G-7 countries remained mostly unchanged: approximately 1.9 percent for the first ten years from 1985 and around 2.0 percent for the 15 years thereafter, when Japan’s economy fell into deflation. This indicates that, during the 25 years as a whole, Japan and the other major economies generally experienced a long downtrend in their inflation rates.  I see in this the possibility that Japan’s deflation might have been brought about by the downtrend in global inflation.  In particular, a large negative output gap – a state of excessive supply – continues to be seen in the major economies since the Lehman shock, on the back of balance-sheet adjustments in the aftermath of the credit bubble. This has created an environment where the inflation rate is subject to downward pressure, and such developments overseas could also be considered to have exerted downward pressure on price developments in Japan.  B. Major factor behind the difference between inflation rates in Japan and the United States: the service sector  I would also like to compare and examine price developments in Japan and abroad. For example, if we compare price developments in Japan and the United States, in Japan the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI was minus 0.2 percent on average between 1997 and 2011, while in the United States it was 2.4 percent, resulting in a gap of 2.6 percentage points. The major factor behind this was a difference in the contribution of prices of services less rent, which accounted for about one-third of the 2.6 percentage point gap, or 0.9 percentage point. When rent was included, services prices accounted for almost two-thirds of the gap, or about 1.7 percentage points. In my view, the fact that services prices are typically susceptible to developments in wages may indicate the reason why Japan’s price structure is prone to deflation and suggest how deflation can be overcome.  C. Relationship between the potential growth rate, wages, and prices  As seen earlier, according to the OECD, since 2009 – when the negative output gap expanded worldwide due to the effects of the Lehman shock – the negative output gap in Japan has not been particularly large compared with other major economies, and this suggests that the level of the output gap does not solely determine the level of the inflation rate. In considering the cause of deflation in Japan, attention should therefore be paid to the supply-side factors, such as the rate of increase in labor productivity and the economy’s potential growth rate.  In Japan, there is a relatively strong correlation between the potential growth rate per capita and medium- to long-term inflation expectations. This relationship is considered to reflect the customary practice prevailing between employers and employees: when medium- to long-term growth expectations declined after the bursting of the economic bubble, Japanese firms tended to adjust wages rather than employment, and workers tended to accept such adjustments. Although Japan has experienced prolonged deflation that is unprecedented among major economies, its unemployment rate has remained very low relative to other economies and the employment situation has shown outstanding stability. In the United States, on the other hand, employment has fallen but declines in wages and prices have remained quite limited amid economic deterioration. These contrasts show how means of adjustment in the labor market differ between Japan and the United States.  With these points taken into account, an end to deflation and a further rise in Japan’s inflation rate require efforts to strengthen the growth potential to raise the economy’s potential growth rate and subsequently boost growth expectations. Such improvements are expected to result 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  in an increase in services prices through a rise in the rate of wage increase. However, if wages increase unaccompanied by a strengthening in the growth potential and a rise in productivity, this will depress corporate profits, which in turn could restrain business fixed investment and hamper steady economic growth. The possibility of a resultant deterioration in the employment and income situation is a matter of concern. On the other hand, if the inflation rate increases while the growth potential does not strengthen and wage inflation remains unchanged, the general standard of living will fall in real terms. In sum, the economic condition to be sought is a balanced increase in wages and prices on the basis of a strengthened growth potential.  V. Current and future conduct of monetary policy  A. Decisions made at the MPM held on January 21 and 22, 2013  At the MPM held on January 21 and 22, 2013, the Bank decided to take additional steps to provide monetary accommodation decisively by introducing two measures: the “price stability target” of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI; and the “open-ended asset purchasing method” for the Asset Purchase Program (hereafter the Program). In addition to these two measures, another important decision was the strengthening of policy coordination between the government and the Bank. The Bank, together with the government, decided and released “Joint Statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan on Overcoming Deflation and Achieving Sustainable Economic Growth.”  The Bank had previously adopted a “price stability goal in the medium to long term,” judged to be in a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, and set a goal at 1 percent for the time being. As I will explain in detail later, the Bank replaced this goal with the “price stability target” of 2 percent for the following reasons. First, there is an increasing awareness among the general public that even if the Bank were to use the term “price stability target” it would not conduct monetary policy in an automatic manner in pursuit of a certain inflation rate. And second, as progress is achieved through efforts by a wide range of entities – such as those by the government to strengthen the competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy – an increase is likely to occur in the inflation rate at which firms and households perceive price stability – the basis for their economic activity. There is uncertainty with regard to how the strengthening of the growth potential of Japan’s economy will proceed, but the Bank expects the setting of this very ambitious target to have the secondary effect of encouraging efforts by a range of entities. In this regard, the “price stability target” of 2 percent could serve in a sense as a kind of “slogan” for the general public in the revitalization of Japan’s economy.  Moreover, the Bank has introduced the “open-ended asset purchasing method” without setting any termination date, to clearly show its strong determination to achieve the “price stability target” of 2 percent, which it considers will result in greater policy effects. Under the current purchasing method – which makes a commitment in terms of the future level of the total size of the Program – the total size of the Program will be increased to 101 trillion yen by end-2013 from 65 trillion yen at end-2012, as had been planned earlier. From January 2014 and for some time, the Bank will purchase about 13 trillion yen in financial assets, including about 2 trillion yen of JGBs, every month without setting any termination date.  B. The Bank’s price stability target and its importance  Next, I would like to discuss in more detail the inflation targeting system, looking at examples of overseas systems. Article 2 of the Bank of Japan Act stipulates that “currency and monetary control by the Bank of Japan shall be aimed at achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy.” This tells us that achieving price stability is the precondition for the sound development of the national economy and that the sound development of the national economy – which deeply impacts public welfare – is the ultimate target of the monetary policy conduct. Based on this thinking, in policy conduct 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  aimed at achieving the price stability target, it is most important to aim at contributing to the stability and development of the economy in the medium to long term, and to carefully conduct policy while monitoring the soundness of the financial system. At the same time, it must be noted that policy conduct aimed at guiding the inflation rate to the target in an automatic manner in fact entails the risk of hampering medium- to long-term economic stability.  C. Flexible inflation targeting system  The introduction of an inflation target by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1988 was a first among the central banks of the major economies, followed by the central banks of Canada and the United Kingdom. In New Zealand, the central bank aimed at the target rigidly in the beginning, but later it was recognized that this rigidity was destabilizing the economy. For this reason, the introduction of an inflation target was deferred by the central banks of Japan, the United States, and other major economies in Europe. Subsequently, however, central banks adopting an inflation target have made adjustments to boost flexibility. Many of the central banks have not specified the timing for achieving the target. Even the Bank of Canada – which specified the term for achieving the target as “typically within a horizon of six to eight quarters” – allows adjustments in the length of the term depending on developments in economic activity and prices to ensure the target’s flexibility. As a result, central banks in major economies are at present conducting policy aimed at achieving sustainable growth with price stability while assessing the current developments and outlook for economic activity and prices as well as examining various risks, including those stemming from the accumulation of financial imbalances. This policy framework is often referred to as the flexible inflation targeting system. The price stability target adopted by the Bank of Japan is based on the same thinking. The Bank has clarified that it will aim to achieve this price stability target of 2 percent “at the earliest possible time.” The intention behind this clarification is that, as discussed earlier, in achieving an inflation target it is important – from the viewpoint of ensuring medium- to long-term stability of the economy – to secure flexibility in the policy conduct while carefully ascertaining risks arising from, for example, the accumulation of financial imbalances. The Bank will aim to achieve the target “at the earliest possible time” on this basis.  In other major economies, central banks have introduced inflation targets with the aim of containing rising inflation and reinforcing their independence from the government by ensuring the transparency of their policy conduct. The Bank of Japan, on the other hand, has introduced the price stability target in an attempt to overcome deflation. This point differs from the inflation targets of other central banks, and therefore the Bank’s action may be regarded as an unprecedented endeavor.  D. Votes at the MPMs held in January and February  So far, I have explained the decisions made at the MPM held on January 21 and 22, 2013. At the meeting, I voted against the introduction of the price stability target of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. The main reasons for my vote have already been outlined in the minutes of the MPM, which were released on February 19. Although my remarks here will thus repeat them, I would like to briefly review the three reasons outlined in the minutes. First, while the inflation rate consistent with sustainable price stability pursued by the Bank is considered to be largely affected by the general public’s current perception of price developments, 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI had rarely been achieved in the past two decades, and based on the general public’s current perception of price developments that is built on such past experience, the 2 percent inflation rate is considerably higher than the inflation rate that is considered at this point to be consistent with sustainable price stability. Second, this suggested that, even if the central bank were to set 2 percent inflation as a target, this alone is highly unlikely to substantially influence inflation expectations. Third, efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening the growth potential of Japan’s economy are essential in order to achieve the 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  2 percent target, but if the 2 percent target were set before such efforts made progress and the effects of these efforts were confirmed, this could impair the credibility of monetary policy due to considerable uncertainty regarding achievement of the target. For these reasons, I judged that the Bank’s commitment to do its utmost to achieve the target of 1 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for the time being would further enhance the policy effects and be more appropriate in the current situation.  Subsequently, at the MPM held on February 13 and 14, I voted for the public statement that included the following sentence: “the Bank has set the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI.” I still hold the view that it is not an easy task to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. Neither is there a significant change in the general public’s perception of price developments at present. However, in line with the recognition that a range of entities, including the government and the private sector, will fulfill their respective roles to overcome deflation, I considered that financial market developments after the introduction of the price stability target of 2 percent appeared to reflect expectations for the Bank’s monetary policy and the government’s various policy measures, and that it was important to further increase credibility regarding the Bank’s decision on the price stability target of 2 percent from the viewpoint of overcoming deflation. While monitoring the effects of monetary policy and their spread through the economy, the Bank will conduct policy aimed at achieving this target in a responsible manner, by carefully communicating its policy intentions and considering a decisive action for additional monetary easing as necessary.  E. The Bank’s policy stance on achieving the 2 percent price stability target  In my opinion, the Bank’s decision to introduce the open-ended asset purchasing method with the aim of achieving the 2 percent price stability target indicates that asset purchases through market operations will continue to form the core of the Bank’s policy to enhance monetary easing. Specifically, this decision is based on the idea that the Bank will give greater consideration to producing policy effects by affecting market prices, which is what the comprehensive monetary easing policy has been aiming for. This means encouraging a decline in longer-term interest rates and a reduction in risk premiums and thereby ensuring financial conditions that allow firms and households to raise funds at low cost.  There seems to be a range of views in financial markets currently on the feasibility of the 2 percent price stability target. If any doubt arose in the markets over the Bank’s stance on achieving the target, this could reduce the policy effects. Therefore, with a view to avoiding such a situation and continuing to clearly show the Bank’s strong determination to achieve the target, it is important to steadily conduct asset purchases under the Program in a sustainable manner and thereby produce the intended policy effects. In this regard, I will discuss three points: steadily increasing the amount outstanding of the Program; strengthening coordination with the government and maintaining fiscal consolidation; and communication to the public to gain understanding of the Bank’s policy intention.  F. Issues regarding the operation of the asset purchase program  First, let me mention an issue concerning the payment of interest under the complementary deposit facility, or the payment of interest on excess reserve balances of financial institutions’ current accounts at the Bank. This issue needs to take into account the fact that undersubscription – that is, aggregate bids falling short of the Bank’s offers – has been occurring frequently in the fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral since the turn of the year. Generally speaking, as the degree of monetary easing is enhanced, financial institutions’ demand for liquidity will be met sufficiently, thereby reducing their need for funds provided by the Bank; consequently market participants will have a reduced incentive to submit bids for the Bank’s market operations. Moreover, the bidding activity for market operations is affected by not only the supply and demand conditions of market participants’ funds but also various events and speculation in the markets. Therefore, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  with regard to financial institutions’ current accounts held at the Bank, the balances of which change along with the Bank’s asset purchases, careful deliberation is necessary in discussing the lowering or the abolishment of the payment of interest on excess reserve balances of the current accounts. Since such a move would affect financial institutions’ incentive to hold excess reserves at the Bank, the costs and benefits should be assessed while taking into account the sustainability of asset purchases under the Program.  Second, it should be noted that the remaining maturity of JGBs to be purchased under the Program is currently one to three years. This takes into account the fact that the average financing term used by Japanese firms is around three years. On this point, some market participants, for example, have called for extending the remaining maturity of the JGBs to be purchased under the Program. Some have noted the importance of enhancing policy effects by encouraging a decline in longer-term interest rates, and others have mentioned the need to conduct asset purchases under the Program smoothly and to ensure the sustainability of the purchases.  And third, the Bank purchases risk assets – namely, CP, corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) – for the purpose of encouraging a decline in risk premiums in the markets, while paying due attention to the potential cost of impairing the Bank’s balance sheet. On this point, some market participants have stated that the Bank should increase the amount of risk assets it purchases.  In this regard, in deliberating on the possibility of either extending the remaining maturity of JGBs to be purchased under the Program or increasing the amount of risk assets to be purchased, it is essential for the Bank to carefully assess costs and benefits in light of its policy objective of achieving the 2 percent price stability target, while giving due consideration to the two points mentioned earlier: ensuring the sustainability of asset purchases under the Program and producing the intended policy effects.  G. Importance of strengthening coordination with the government and maintaining fiscal consolidation  The joint statement indicates that the Bank sets the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, and under the target it will pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time. At the same time, the government will formulate measures for strengthening the competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy, and promote them strongly, as well as steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure.  In order for the Bank to pursue powerful monetary easing with the aim of achieving the 2 percent price stability target, it is important for the credibility of fiscal management to be firmly ensured in the financial markets. In this regard, it is worth noting the obvious: the policy coordination mentioned in the joint statement does not indicate “monetization,” that is, the central bank’s financing of the government’s fiscal deficit. The firm guarantee by law in many countries of a central bank’s independence is the result of bitter experience. Specifically, the underwriting of government securities by central banks during wartime led to a substantial expansion of government debt, which became a burden for future generations. This underwriting also accelerated inflation and destabilized financial markets and the financial system, which seriously degraded people’s living conditions.  Japan experienced sharp inflation immediately after the end of World War II, and in response the yen was revalued and a freeze on bank deposits was imposed. While the number of people who actually experienced these events is gradually declining, one of the vital roles of a central bank is to continue to provide a warning about the dangers of monetization based on the lessons of history.  In addition to preventing monetization at all costs, it is essential to avoid even the emergence of mere doubt in financial markets as to whether the Bank’s action could be considered monetization. If such doubt should emerge, the credibility of fiscal policies would be 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  undermined to a substantial degree and a fiscal crisis could occur, which in turn would inflict considerable damage on economic activity, together with a crisis in the financial system. It should be recognized that, in such a case, the quality of people’s lives would be significantly impaired.  In addition to the joint statement in which the government clarified its stance of emphasizing fiscal discipline, the Cabinet decided the fiscal consolidation target, which aims at halving the primary balance deficit relative to GDP by fiscal 2015 from the fiscal 2010 level and achieving a surplus by fiscal 2020. It appears that these moves will contribute to containing the risk that concern over monetization will emerge in financial markets. If the government’s determination regarding fiscal consolidation spreads further in the markets – through its communication about the consistency between the supplementary budget for fiscal 2012 and the medium-term fiscal consolidation policy as well as the path to achieving fiscal consolidation – this will give the Bank more room to proceed with purchasing government securities without causing concern over monetization. This would also help achieve the 2 percent price stability target.  H.  Importance of communication to the public to gain understanding of the Bank’s policy intention  With a view to strengthening the policy coordination between the Bank and the government, it is important to deepen the public’s understanding of the Bank’s thinking on the conduct of monetary policy and its specific actions. The Bank considers it essential to make its utmost efforts to this end. To my understanding, the issues that need to be explained thoroughly to deepen the public’s understanding are as follows. First, as the principle of the conduct of monetary policy, it is important that the policy should aim at achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy. Second, regarding the effects of monetary policy on price developments, I continue to attach importance to the transmission mechanism in which monetary policy influences demand, thereby encouraging the improvement in the output gap; in this regard, the transmission mechanism in which monetary policy underpins inflation expectations is also noteworthy. And third, I consider that the medium- to long-term trend in inflation rates is largely determined by supply-side factors, such as the growth rate of productivity and the potential growth rate of the economy, or in other words, by the growth potential of the economy.  I. Function of Policy Board members in making monetary policy decisions  In the remainder of my remarks, I will briefly touch on the central bank committee system in which monetary policy decisions are made as a result of deliberations among committee members, rather than by any one individual. The Bank of Japan Act stipulates that the Policy Board shall be established, composed of nine members – the Governor, two Deputy Governors, and six Members of the Policy Board. It also stipulates that matters concerning monetary policy shall be decided by the Policy Board. This type of committee system is currently adopted by not only the Bank of Japan but also other major central banks. In his book The Quiet Revolution: Central Banking Goes Modern, Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, positively assessed the advantage of group decision making by policy committee on the basis of certain assumptions. He pointed to two developments behind the spread of the committee system: the worldwide trend of increased central bank independence from the government; and growing recognition of the system’s success in the United States and Germany, where it had been introduced as a pioneering effort. He also noted that decision making by members of a committee could help avoid certain risks associated with decision making by a single individual and thereby generate better outcomes.  In the vote taking, each member of the Bank of Japan’s Policy Board is given an equal vote and makes a judgment independently. The split vote that occurred at the January 2013 MPM demonstrates that each member’s autonomy is respected. This is also reflected in the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  provisions of the Bank of Japan Act that the members of the Policy Board shall be appointed by the Cabinet, subject to the consent of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, and shall not be dismissed against their will during their terms of office of five years, except in special cases such as becoming incapable of carrying out their duties due to mental or physical disorder.  At the same time, we the Policy Board members conduct our daily duties by fully recognizing the responsibility that we – who are not chosen by election – are granted considerable authority to make monetary policy decisions, which significantly affect people’s lives. Therefore, in order to maintain and enhance the public’s trust, I believe that it is vital to further enhance the transparency of the conduct of monetary policy – that is, communication to the Diet and the public by thoroughly explaining the Bank’s thinking on the conduct of monetary policy. We are also listening with all due respect to the government’s and public’s opinions on monetary policy conduct and working to incorporate them into policymaking, and I regard today’s meeting as one such opportunity for this. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Post-trade harmonisation and financial market integration in Europe Opening remarks by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the conference “Post-trade harmonisation and the integration of financial markets: a joint effort”, organised by the European Central Bank and the European Commission, Frankfurt am Main, 19 March 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,  I am very pleased to welcome you to Frankfurt today and to open this important conference on post-trade harmonisation and financial market integration in Europe. This conference is the result of a joint effort between the European Central Bank and the European Commission, and I would like to thank the organisers for putting together such an excellent programme. I am very pleased to see that so many distinguished speakers from both the public and private sectors have agreed to share their views on how post-trade harmonisation will contribute to financial integration in Europe. In times of severe economic challenges, it is particularly important that our commitment to achieving a truly single European market is reaffirmed. As we all understand, a well-functioning internal market generates many benefits, including lower prices, more freedom of choice for individuals and better opportunities for firms.  What Europe has achieved so far is indisputable – and it is often taken for granted. People sometimes focus on perceived difficulties caused by the single market from an individual or national perspective. But it is important to acknowledge the huge benefits of European integration for our daily lives and day-to-day business.  Greater financial integration is a key part of building the single market – and something that improves the functioning of national financial systems. Financial integration leads to better risk-sharing and diversification, it makes markets deeper and more liquid, and it encourages competition, which in turn reduces the costs of intermediation. In addition, financial integration fosters more efficient allocation of capital, higher productivity, and stronger and more sustainable non-inflationary economic growth. Financial integration is essential to making Europe stronger, so it is very important to the ECB’s Governing Council. We are fully committed to making it happen, especially at a time when the fragmentation of the single financial market has led to fragmentation of the single monetary policy.  As you will be aware, the disruptive effects of severe fragmentation in the single financial market have tangible consequences, such as diverging funding costs for banks. This has resulted in the uneven transmission of our interest rate reductions to firms and households across the euro area. For this reason, the ECB has had to identify the most effective policy tools for repairing these disruptions, while remaining within its mandate. Financial integration is clearly in the interests of the market and it is strongly supported by the post-trade harmonisation initiatives that are taking place within the EU at the legislative, operational and business levels. These initiatives all aim to remove national barriers and thus reduce the fragmentation of the European post-trade landscape. The integration of market infrastructure, the harmonisation agenda triggered by T2S and the regulatory framework are the key elements of a coordinated harmonisation effort that complements and supports financial integration.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It is through this lens that the topic of today’s conference should be analysed. Key questions include: how can we contribute to improving post-trade harmonisation? What will this process change? And what actions can we take to benefit from it? The speakers will give us their answers and explore the various harmonisation initiatives, linking them with changes in the regulatory framework and in market infrastructure. Last May, I participated, along with some of you, in the signing of the contractual agreements between the Eurosystem and those CSDs that had decided to participate in T2S. I stressed that the fundamental objective of T2S is to contribute to making Europe a better place to invest. Let me say that this objective is not unique to T2S. It is the objective of all the harmonisation efforts that are being undertaken in the post-trade field, by all parties. It is definitely a joint effort, and what I see is not just the commitment of public authorities at the European or national level, but also the commitment of market participants, CSDs and CCPs. I am sure that we all share the same goal, namely making Europe stronger and more attractive for both domestic and foreign investment, thus stimulating and sustaining growth. Through the coordinated action of so many stakeholders, financial markets will become safer, more transparent and, therefore, more efficient and integrated. Dismantling legal and operational barriers, which is the aim of current EU legislative proposals and new infrastructure such as T2S, will benefit those who adapt their business models to a more competitive landscape. It is important to highlight that the benefits of T2S will be fully achieved if the current harmonisation efforts are successfully implemented at the European level and especially at the national level. Let me be specific here by giving you a few examples. In terms of infrastructure, T2S is the necessary platform for setting up a single European market for securities services. In terms of benefits for Europe, T2S will make the post-trade environment safer and more efficient. It will reduce the cost of settling securities transactions and bring about significant collateral savings for market participants. These collateral savings are particularly valuable at a time when demand for high-quality collateral continues to increase, as a result of both the crisis and new regulatory developments. But reaping the full benefits from the launch of T2S requires that it is complemented by the provisions laid out in the CSD regulation proposed by the Commission. Both initiatives are supported by the harmonisation agenda which has been advanced by the Eurosystem and other European fora. The CSD regulation is critical to post-trade harmonisation efforts in Europe. The ECB’s Governing Council has stated its strong support for the proposed regulation, which will enhance the legal and operational conditions for cross-border settlement in the EU in general and in T2S in particular. In this respect, the ECB has recommended that the proposed regulation and the corresponding implementing acts are adopted prior to the launch of T2S. Work is also in progress at the Eurosystem level to improve the possibilities for the cross-border use of collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, which will increase efficiency. Further benefits are expected from market-led initiatives to enhance the interoperability of triparty services in Europe. I do not want to pre-empt the interesting discussions that you will have today, so let me conclude by saying that everyone needs to be involved in this process. Every contribution matters; and every action is relevant.  I am confident that today’s conference will further clarify the role that each of us has to play in this important phase of European integration, and I look forward to continuing to work on it together. Thank you very much for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 John McDermott: The role of forecasting in monetary policy Speech by Dr John McDermott, Assistant Governor and Head of Economics of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to FINSIA (Financial Services Institute of Australasia), Wellington, 15 March 2013. *      *      * 1. Introduction As is well known, the Reserve Bank Act requires the Bank to seek to maintain price stability, an objective similar in spirit to that of most modern advanced-country central banks. The Governor is legally responsible for monetary policy decisions and they are made independently from the government. Last week he explained in a speech how we make and communicate these and other important Reserve Bank decisions.1  Because the economy is never at rest, and monetary policy actions take time to affect inflation, forecasting economic conditions is an essential part of making these decisions. The forward-looking nature of monetary policy is reflected in the Policy Targets Agreement (PTA) between the Governor of the Bank and the Minister of Finance, which specifies the price stability target as “future CPI inflation outcomes between one percent and three percent on average over the medium term, with a focus on keeping future average inflation near the two percent target midpoint”. There are difficulties and uncertainties involved in assessing the current state of the economy and its likely future path. Modern central banks therefore put a huge amount of energy into forecasting. Events such as the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes showed how we must be prepared to pivot, at times very quickly. Reflecting this complex policymaking environment, the Bank’s Governing Committee is advised by a team of about 40 economists and financial market analysts, including two external monetary policy advisers drawn from the private sector. This speech explains how forecasting fits into the monetary policy process. I’ll address the limitations and trade-offs involved in forecasting and how we manage these in monetary policy decision-making, and illustrate by discussing important issues in the current forecast. 2. The forecasting process and economic framework Forecasting links the Bank’s policy rate decisions and strategy to the requirements set out in the PTA. The forecasting process follows a quarterly cycle with two OCR reviews, one of which is accompanied by the Monetary Policy Statement for the quarter. Through the quarter, we examine the incoming data, update forecast tracks and scenarios, and discuss policy risks. Inputs to the process are many and various. We draw on official data, surveys and other information covering output, sales, employment, consumption, investment, exports, imports, wages, prices and so on. We visit businesses and labour organisations representing all the country’s regions and economic sectors to gather up-to-date perspectives on economic developments “on the ground”. We analyse other agencies’ forecasts and stay in close touch with other central banks. Our market monitoring and prudential supervision activities provide financial and credit market intelligence. Finally, our external monetary policy advisers are a key source of private sector input to our deliberations.                                                  1  Wheeler, G (2013) “Decision making in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand”, speech delivered to the University of Auckland Business School, 7 March. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches We use all this to form a coherent picture of international and domestic conditions and a macroeconomic projection. The projection captures our view of the most likely future developments in inflation, output, employment, interest rates, the exchange rate and other key macroeconomic variables, based on the information to hand and our understanding of how the economy works. The economic framework Forming an assessment that can support policy decisions requires an economic framework to boil down the large and complex set of information into something more manageable. The framework includes some fundamental economic principles to anchor our analysis and dialogue. These include the big lesson from the 1970s experience, that you can’t sustainably get higher growth by tolerating a bit more inflation, and that to try to do so will eventually cause high and variable inflation, and damage the economy. Long-run growth is fundamentally determined by growth in the productive base of the economy – that is, labour, the capital stock and knowledge. The best contribution monetary policy can make to long-run growth is to keep aggregate inflation predictably low, so that it can form a useful benchmark for pricing behaviour. This involves counteracting, where possible, the inflation effects of emerging economic pressures (sometimes referred to as shocks). In understanding the macroeconomic consequences of shocks, the main effects to account for are as follows. Firstly, inflation tends to fall when demand is weak enough for there to be slack in the labour and goods markets (technically, a “negative output gap”), and rise when the opposite is true. This relationship is most obvious in the case of non-tradable inflation (see Figure 1). Secondly, investment and consumption demand tend to rise when interest rates fall. Thirdly, the exchange rate tends to be high when relative prospective returns available in New Zealand are above those offshore. Finally, short term interest rates, reflecting the price stability objective of monetary policy, tend to rise in response to increases in future inflation pressure.  All of these key macroeconomic variables are therefore linked together by economic behavioural tendencies. We say “tendencies” because other things than those mentioned matter too, and may at times be substantial drivers of the patterns we see in the data. For example, a major source of exchange rate fluctuations in New Zealand is the outlook for the world prices of our commodity exports and the terms of trade. Housing investment moves quite substantially with the ebbs and flows of net migration. Government spending and other fiscal policy changes are a further source of demand shock. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 The role of models and the need for judgement The overall variation in the data can therefore be viewed as a combination of the sequence of shocks and the responses of the economy to those shocks. One major task of the economic analyst is to disentangle the two, at least conceptually. One tool we use to help with the task is a structural forecasting model, which continues our long tradition of using such models in forecasting and policy analysis. The model is calibrated to the “typical” economic behaviour observed over the past two decades of price stability in New Zealand, and embeds the fairly standard views of economic behaviour outlined above. Its key features include intuitive economic mechanisms, a relatively simple structure, and adaptability to accommodate a range of economic circumstances. Using a model provides a number of benefits. It enables us to link policy decisions to our objectives and to the economic outlook, to consider simultaneous shocks and interactions among economic variables systematically and consistently, and to ensure that there is some consistency in interpreting the flow of data between forecast updates and policy decisions. But even the most advanced models can only be very abstract representations of the economy, and our forecasting model is deliberately designed to be relatively simple and adaptable. Too much complexity would make it difficult to understand the transmission mechanisms and dynamics in the model, and would be unlikely to improve forecasting accuracy materially. Judgemental input to any model and adjustment to the model’s outputs are therefore a necessary part of building up the forecast – and indeed the process of adding judgement itself helps us form views about the outlook in a systematic manner. There are three main motivations for adding judgement currently. Firstly, responses to rare events such as the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes will, by design, not be picked up in the forecasts of a model that is calibrated to the “average” experience over the last 20 years. Secondly, like most macroeconomic models, our model does not explicitly model the financial sector, which is a key feature of modern economies. The modelling framework does include an interest rate spread between the floating mortgage rates and the 90-day bank bill rate, and this is the point where we typically add judgement to account for financial factors in the model. Finally, judgement is needed to account for how the economy responds at different points in the business cycle, since models generally only generate the average response seen across the cycle. Judgemental adjustment in the framework often is motivated by the qualitative information we receive from business visits, as well as from the knowledge of experienced forecasters gained over many business cycles. As noted, our forecasts are updated regularly. As new data comes in each quarter, we are able to learn from our errors, get a sense of which bits of the model to trust and which to keep adjusting, and revise our forecasts accordingly. 3. Monetary policy, risk management and trade-offs Monetary policy operates in a complex environment. In developing our central projection, we must consider multiple risks and trade-offs. Monetary policy and risk management The likelihoods of various economic outcomes affect markedly the costs and benefits of alternative policy actions. Forming a view on these likelihoods is, furthermore, subject to a range of uncertainties. Firstly, the information on the economy’s current state and direction and rate of movement can be difficult to read, conflicting and sometimes revised. Secondly, some important economic concepts cannot even be directly observed, including the “potential” level of output consistent with stable inflation, or the “neutral” rate of interest that 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches has neither a stimulatory nor a contractionary effect on spending. Thirdly, our understanding of economic behaviour is imperfect, and behaviour itself can shift over time as the economy’s structure and opportunities available to firms and households change. Because of these uncertainties, monetary policy can often appear “cautious”, in the sense that, under normal circumstances, we tend to adjust interest rates quite smoothly to economic developments, at least compared to the observed volatility in the data. This reflects a desire not to jerk the economy around in response to bumps in the data that may turn out to be quite temporary. But now and then the economy is hit by a big and unusual shock quite outside the range of possibilities one might reasonably anticipate, for the purposes of monetary policy at least. The series of Canterbury earthquakes, or the events of the global financial crisis, are obvious examples. When such big events hit, the monetary response instead may be very rapid, reflecting that we can be sure that the outlook has markedly changed. These uncertainties explain the limited predictive power of economic forecasts. Our analysis generally suggests that our forecasting track record is somewhat better than the average of other forecasters.2 But what is also clear is that all forecasters face difficulties in predicting future economic outcomes beyond the next few quarters. Quite simply, much can happen over that timeframe. The central projection in our Monetary Policy Statement therefore represents just one path of the many possible. Monetary policy and trade-offs Even if we knew the future perfectly, we would face important choices about how quickly and strongly to react to economic pressures and to seek to restore future inflation to target. These choices have impacts on the economic volatility during the adjustment period. The PTA recognises this trade-off. It requires the Bank to seek to avoid unnecessary instability in interest rates, output and the exchange rate in its pursuit of the price stability target. This is known as flexible inflation targeting and all inflation-targeting countries take the same basic approach. The forecasting framework enables these trade-offs to be systematically addressed and balanced. There’s often concern, for example, that increases to the policy interest rate will adversely affect growth by causing exchange rate appreciation. But we do not hike the interest rate for no reason. While higher interest rates are normally associated with a higher exchange rate, this usually reflects strengthening of the economy due to other forces on spending, such as a pickup in foreign demand, rising terms of trade, or an increase in government spending. It therefore does not follow that keeping interest rates lower than otherwise in order to prevent exchange rate appreciation would necessarily be successful. Assuming the inflation target is credible, strength in the domestic economy will generally cause the exchange rate to appreciate even without immediate policy tightening, as people will anticipate eventual monetary tightening in order to limit rising inflation pressure. This kind of response is consistent with the principles of economic behaviour outlined above. The sustained economic expansion in New Zealand prior to the global financial crisis illustrates these trade-offs well. The OCR was steadily raised 200 basis points from 2003 to 2006 and the New Zealand dollar exchange rate moved from 55 US cents to 75 US cents. Even a tightening of monetary conditions of this magnitude was not sufficient to prevent CPI                                                  2  The latest assessment of our forecasting accuracy is Labbé and Pepper (2009). McCaw and Ranchhod (2002) is also useful for more detailed discussion of the reasons for the historical pattern of forecasting errors. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 inflation from reaching more than three percent by the end of 2006 (Figure 2). We could perhaps have leaned harder against this expansion at the time, but this would probably have exaggerated the exchange rate cycle on both the upswing and the downswing.  We draw several lessons from this experience. One is that when there are strong forces on the New Zealand economy, policy settings may need to lean quite hard against them. A second is that financial cycles can be surprisingly large and long-lasting. A third is that such forces in a small open economy can cause large exchange rate swings. Difficult judgements must be made about the balance across the trade-offs. Issues in our current forecasts Our current forecasts also show the current challenges in predicting the balance of opposing economic forces, recognising the uncertainties, and accounting for trade-offs. The combination of the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes has left a legacy of tough economic issues to resolve. The persistently elevated exchange rate, high household debt overhang, and substantial fiscal consolidation will weigh on the economy, but acting in the opposite direction are rising house prices and the large construction spending surge from the Canterbury rebuild. Our central projection indicates low inflation in the near-term but strengthening over the medium-term. Mindful of our requirement to focus on future average inflation over the medium term, our policy strategy is to “smooth through” these near-term variations in inflation in a forward-looking manner. The “net” of all these effects and their timing are quite sensitive to assumptions. Our task with our quarterly forecast updates is to keep up to speed with the incoming evidence on whether our assumptions are accurate. Judgement is particularly important in respect of future movements in the exchange rate. The exchange rate can move sharply and suddenly, for reasons that cannot be foreseen even if in hindsight the connections seem quite obvious. Often, sudden and large downward movements (depreciations) result from large and sudden shocks from offshore, such as seen at the onset of the Asian crisis in mid-1997 or the sudden intensification of global financial disruptions in 2008 (Figure 3). 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  At other times, an unexpectedly long period of strong or weak relative economic performance, or strong forces such as commodity price swings or domestic demand pressures, can generate substantial and prolonged departures of the exchange rate from its long-run average levels. A second key judgement in our forecasts is the extent to which household spending is constrained by high debt levels and the GFC experience, which has implications for the degree to which the strengthening housing market will feed into private consumption. Finally, the profile and wider spillover effects into construction costs of the Canterbury rebuild will depend upon how capacity pressures are resolved. Our current judgements are that the household debt position means consumption is likely to follow less of a pronounced upswing as a result of the housing market upturn than has historically been the case, and that the concentrated character of the rebuild means its spillover effects to housing markets in the rest of the country will be muted. However, since there is little recent experience against which to benchmark these events, we will have to monitor the evidence carefully to ensure that our judgements in this area remain reasonable. The current environment also confronts us with trade-offs across policy objectives. Near-term inflation is low and is forecast to gradually increase back to the midpoint of the target range. An interest rate cut might help inflation return to target sooner. But such a cut would also probably exacerbate the current strength in house prices, risking further increases in private debt levels, potentially raising financial stability issues. Indeed, the PTA specifies that, in setting monetary policy, we must monitor asset prices and have regard to the soundness and efficiency of the financial system.3 On the other hand, while an interest rate hike might limit housing market risks, it could also place further upward pressure on the exchange rate. In the near future, macro-prudential measures will be part of the toolkit for responding to financial stability risks. These measures will generally support and complement our efforts to stabilise inflation with monetary policy, as upswings in the macroeconomy often coincide with increasing asset prices and leverage. We’re currently engaged in consultation regarding the use of macro-prudential instruments and will say more about this in our upcoming Financial Stability Report.                                                  3  A box in the December 2012 Monetary Policy Statement explains the new PTA. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 4. Forecasting supports accountability and communication activities Forecasts, risk assessment and management of trade-offs are a critical element of our communication of policy strategy and accountability for our actions. We aim to be as clear as possible in the Monetary Policy Statement about both the economic outlook and the strategy framing monetary policy decisions and plans.4 Shortly after the Statement is published, the Governor holds a press conference and the Statement is reviewed by Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. The Bank’s Board of Directors, who are appointed by the Minister of Finance, formally review each Statement and OCR decision as part of their duty to monitor constantly the Reserve Bank’s performance of its obligations under the Act. These various examinations and question and answer sessions are very thorough. In addition, senior Bank staff travel around New Zealand and give talks explaining the main considerations supporting the latest decision. By explaining the rationale for policy decisions, we enable our views to be discussed and challenged. The Statement thus acts as a record of our monetary policy deliberations. Some other central banks instead publish minutes of their monetary policy meetings, which amounts to much the same thing. Our communications activities are also intended to assist the economy by stabilising inflation expectations. Published forecasts help markets assess the economic environment and understand our policy strategy.5 We have published policy outlooks since 1997 in the form of a future path for short term interest rates. A number of other central banks, including those of Sweden and Norway, have subsequently followed this practice. The future interest rate track in any projection represents the Bank’s best view of the outlook for monetary policy settings given the information to hand at the time, and is not a commitment to the particular path shown. Our analysis shows that as long as the markets do not regard our published interest rate path as a commitment, there are benefits for the economy from the publication of the numbers.6  There are various ways of communicating the policy outlook. We present our projection as a single narrow line. Of course, around this line is a range of possibilities that widens markedly the further ahead one looks. We find that projecting a single central projection, though, simplifies the discussion considerably, and makes the forecast numbers easier to connect to the forecast story. There are obvious risks of oversimplification or inadvertently conveying unrealistic precision in such an approach. But on the other hand, showing an unhelpfully wide range can undermine the central message. Different central banks handle this issue in different ways. Some use “fan charts” showing distributions of possible outcomes, while others use explicit or implicit statements of policy “bias” rather than a projected path for interest rates. In our case we’ve placed emphasis on the clarity of the basis for our policy decisions and outlook, which we think large fans could obscure to the extent that they hide the relationships between the different macroeconomic variables in the forecast story. As another means to show these relationships and how they inform policy, we now and then make use of “alternative scenarios”, where we work through quantitatively the implications for the forecast numbers of different settings for the key assumptions, to show how outcomes might differ from our central projections. For example, the Monetary Policy Statement released yesterday features an alternative scenario and discussion of the (distinct) possibility                                                  4  Blinder et al. (2008) discuss these aspects of monetary policy communications in detail. 5  Svensson (2006) and Woodford (2005) offer useful discussions of this principle. 6  Bergstrom and Karagedikli (2013). 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches that the exchange rate might follow a different path, higher or lower, to that in our current central projection. 5. Conclusion Forecasting is a difficult but essential part of modern monetary policy. This reflects that the economy is never in a state of rest, and that there are lags between changes in the OCR and their effects on the economy. Forecasting provides value by explaining the economic story and framing the risks underpinning the policy strategy. If done well, this process helps policymakers, firms and households to plan for and adapt to changing circumstances. As well as enforcing internal discipline and structure on policymakers’ deliberations, an explicit, coherent and transparent forecasting framework also facilitates external accountability. Forecasting, central bank independence and a strong accountability framework are now all part of the orthodox, “full” framework for inflation targeting adopted by more than 20 developed countries.7  The models and processes we use to support our forecasting are carefully designed. As in the design of any process there are trade-offs that must be managed. We want to capture complex economic relationships and phenomena, while preserving the flexibility to accommodate unusual circumstances and a grasp of the essentials. No one in the forecasting business is under any illusions that what they do is a perfect science. Moreover, the economy is not a collection of mechanical equations, but a growing, changing system of interacting human choices. With experience comes improvement. Currently, monetary policy faces some big forecasting issues. One is the treatment of the exchange rate and its likely future path, which will have substantial effects on the economy. Another is the reconstruction in Canterbury and the effects flowing from that. The outcomes in practice could, and probably will, turn out quite differently to our projections at any particular time. But the important thing is that we’ve done the best we can to anticipate the different possibilities and how we might have to react to them. In our quarterly forecast cycle we do our best to update, test, revise and communicate our views thoroughly. This enables us to keep the OCR as well-positioned as we can, and our policy strategy well-understood, so that our efforts to maintain stable inflation do not cause more economic volatility than necessary.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Masaaki Shirakawa: Toward strengthening the competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy Speech by Mr Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Executive Member Meeting of the Policy Board of Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), Tokyo, 28 February 2013. *      *      * Introduction It is a great honor to have this opportunity to address the executive member meeting of the Policy Board of Nippon Keidanren today. Before I start, let me express my deepest appreciation for the information and views on current developments in economic and financial activities as well as on policy conduct provided to us by all the member firms. Today’s speech is the last one I will give as Governor of the Bank of Japan. However, it was not difficult for me to decide today’s main topic, “toward strengthening the competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy”, because it is the most pressing issue for Japan at present. It is also a very important theme for the Bank of Japan. As you know, at the Monetary Policy Meeting in January, the Bank decided to introduce a “price stability target” and set it at 2 percent.1 This target was introduced based on the recognition that progress would be made by a wide range of entities in their efforts toward strengthening the competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy (Chart 1). For this reason, it is extremely important in conducting monetary policy whether such efforts will actually make progress. In the following, I would like to talk about this theme while paying due regard to the perspectives of macroeconomics, corporate behavior, and economic policymaking. I. The aim of economic policy While there has been active discussion regarding the conduct of economic policies in Japan, I will first consider the aim of economic policy and the kind of situation we expect Japan’s economy to attain. Needless to say, the ultimate aim of economic policy is to raise the living standard of each citizen. While there is no single indicator for gauging people’s quality of life, if we were to put this in approximate terms, the key aim of macroeconomic policy is to raise the per capita consumption level, or to raise the real gross domestic product (GDP), which is closely related to the former, in a sustainable manner (Chart 2). Having said this, a more detailed discussion is necessary when considering the various options regarding economic policy on the basis of the situation facing Japan’s economy. First, there is a need to consider the effects of the decline in the labor force due to the rapid aging of Japan’s population. Japan’s current real GDP remains below the level seen prior to the Lehman shock. Looking at per capita real GDP figures, the drop for Japan is relatively small compared with countries such as those in Europe (Chart 3). Furthermore, in terms of the level of real GDP per working-age person, Japan has exceeded the pre-crisis level, which is a better performance than that of the United States. While “population decline” is one of the clichés used in discussing Japan’s economy, this fundamental fact is oftentimes disregarded when discussing economic developments. Of course, figures do not differ significantly within short time periods of a quarter or a year, but when considering Japan’s                                                 1 For details on decisions made at the Monetary Policy Meeting on January 22, 2013, including the introduction of the “price stability target”, please see Masaaki Shirakawa, “The Roles, Missions, and Challenges of the Central Bank” (Speech at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo), January 25, 2013. http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/press/koen_2013/data/ko130130a.pdf 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  economic policy in the medium to long term, it is important to think in terms of changes in per capita or per worker data. Second, we need to take account of the progress in economic globalization. Specifically, it is necessary to look not only at real GDP but also at real gross national income (GNI). Real GNI is a concept of income that results from making the following two adjustments to real GDP. One source of adjustment is the overseas income of Japanese nationals. Looking at figures for 2012, overseas income amounts to 14.3 trillion yen – that is, 3.0 percent of nominal GDP. In recent years, profits from outward direct investment have been increasing in addition to profits from outward portfolio investment (Chart 4). The other source of adjustment is the change in real purchasing power due to changes in the foreign terms of trade. Japan’s terms of trade have been deteriorating in recent years, mainly due to the rise in commodity prices against the background of high growth in emerging economies. Trade gains/losses – in other words, real purchasing power arising from changes in the terms of trade – have thus been on a declining trend (Chart 5). Terms of trade undergo changes, not only due to commodity prices but also in response to the pricing power of Japanese firms through the non-price competitiveness of exports. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, for example depreciation of the yen, will raise real GDP through an increase in exports but may at times adversely affect trade gains/losses. Effects on real GNI depend on the net result that takes into account these two adjustments (Chart 6). Setting 2000 as the base year, real overseas income increased by about 2.5 times in 2012, pushing up real GDP for 2012 by 1.9 percent compared with that in 2000. On the other hand, the trade gains pushed real GDP downward by 5.8 percent. Third, another topic for discussion is how to treat nominal GDP and real GDP in considering economic policy. On this point, both of these increase when the economy grows in a sustainable manner, suggesting that the direction of medium- to long-term policy is not all that different depending on which figure we take into account. What I must mention here is the cause-and-effect relationship between the two. The basic causal relationship is that, as real GDP rises, the output gap tightens and prices subsequently rise, resulting in a rise in nominal GDP (Chart 7). There are situations, of course, where prices fluctuate first, as seen during the time of the oil crises. In such a situation, however, economic conditions deteriorate, and this is different from what we wish to see. What we are trying to achieve through economic policy is to raise real GDP, as a result of which nominal GDP will rise. In relation to this, the results of the Opinion Survey on the General Public’s Views and Behavior that the Bank conducts on individuals on a quarterly basis provide some interesting findings. The survey results reveal that approximately 80 percent of the respondents  – irrespective of their sex, age, and occupation – have consistently viewed the price rise as “rather unfavorable” throughout the past surveys (Chart 8). Underlying the survey results is the concern that wages may not rise even if prices rise. A considerable portion of the Japanese public is not simply looking for a situation in which prices rise. In the phrase “overcoming deflation”, people are looking for a situation in which one’s salary rises, employment is secured, and profits increase; in other words, a situation characterized by a well-balanced improvement in economic conditions and consequent rise in prices. The fourth point involves the problem of how to distribute the fruits of economic growth. While market mechanism plays a key role in order for the economy to grow, this requires a perspective of society as a whole that accepts such mechanism at large. On this point, the situation surrounding income distribution is one of the crucial factors. In the United States, during the period of economic expansion preceding the Lehman shock – from 2002 to 2007 – the real incomes of the highest-income households in the top 1 percentile increased by 86 percent and household average income increased by 20 percent. In contrast, the “median” household income – that is, the income that represents the middle of a series of all household incomes arranged in order of size – increased only by 10 percent, which amounts to just half the growth of the average income (Chart 9). The situation surrounding income distribution partly depends on the proportion of the elderly that does not have any earnings, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and reviewing this through a single indicator can therefore be challenging. Japan’s case may not be as extreme as that in the United States. Nevertheless, awareness of the need to achieve well-balanced economic growth, especially for the middle class, has increased around the globe. II. The need to strengthen competitiveness and growth potential Bearing these issues related to the aim of economic policy in mind, let me now move on to the need to strengthen competitiveness and growth potential.2 Looking at developments in a country’s economic growth rate over the longer term, factors affecting it can be broken down into real or supply-side factors – namely, capital stock, labor force, and technological innovation. Explaining this within the framework of so-called growth accounting, the growth rate can be broken down into growth in the number of workers and that of value-added per worker, in other words, the labor productivity growth rate (Chart 10). Mechanically estimating future growth in the number of workers, based on the assumption of the most recent labor participation rate by gender and age, the number of workers in Japan will change at a rate of –0.6 percent per annum in the 2010s and –0.8 percent in the 2020s. Meanwhile, the labor productivity growth rate for the years 2000 through 2008 – a period characterized by relatively favorable economic conditions – was 1.4 percent on an annual basis. Adding this to the aforementioned growth in the number of workers, the average growth will become 0.8 percent for the 2010s and 0.6 percent for the 2020s. This will merely amount to maintaining positive growth over the next two decades. Japan’s economy faces a considerably strong headwind in the form of a decline in the labor force, and we need to more seriously acknowledge its implications. Raising the labor productivity growth rate further will alleviate the problem, of course. Japan has achieved a growth rate slightly exceeding the average for the G-7 countries for the past 10 years, however, and it is not very plausible to think that we can raise it by 1 percent or more at once (Chart 11). At any rate, raising Japan’s growth potential continuously into the future requires work, especially strenuous work, on both the number of workers and the labor productivity growth rate. While efforts by a wide range of entities are necessary in such case, the main actors here, above all, are private firms. The corporate sector has consistently had a savings surplus, together with households, since 1998 (Chart 12). A significant savings surplus by the corporate sector is a phenomenon now observed outside of Japan as well: it has spread to major advanced countries since the start of the 2000s. In terms of the amount of savings surplus relative to GDP, figures for the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States are 6.1 percent, 4.6 percent, and 4.1 percent, respectively. The most significant underlying cause of this savings surplus is the lack of attractive investment opportunities at home amid expanding investment opportunities in the emerging markets. Recently, other causes have also been pointed out, including the securing of funds to offset additional costs that may arise from a lack of funds for corporate pensions mainly resulting from a decline in interest rates. I presume that in your day-to-day decision making, you cannot muster enough confidence to invest at home despite having ample liquidity on hand (Chart 13). In fact, on-hand cash and deposits at Japanese firms has been increasing steadily: the proportion of Japanese firms listed on the First and Second Sections of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) holding cash and deposits exceeding the amount of interest-bearing debt – in other words, firms without net external borrowings – has recently become as high as 43 percent.                                                 2 The importance of strengthening growth potential and of the supply side is something many central banks emphasize. Please see, for example, Speech given by Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the CBI Northern Ireland Mid-Winter Dinner, Belfast, 22 January 2013. http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ publications/Documents/speeches/2013/speech631.pdf 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Of course, firms’ ample on-hand liquidity itself is reasonable up to some level, taking into account experiences such as the post-bubble financial crisis and the aftermath of the failure of Lehman Brothers – that is, the shortage of U.S. dollar funds and the decline in the functioning of the CP market. The current level of on-hand liquidity, however, appears to go well beyond the amount of such precautionary demand. As for the use of excess funds, there are only three options: making real or financial investments at home and abroad; disbursing funds to employees in the form of wages; and returning them to stockholders through dividend payments and share buybacks. The economy will not see positive outcomes unless some kind of change is brought about to the increased liquidity via one of the aforementioned routes. In that sense, it is extremely important to change the business environment, thereby modifying firms’ incentives. That is why in achieving sustainable growth with price stability, efforts toward strengthening the competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy are necessary as much as monetary policy is indispensable in this regard. III. Outline of the course of future measures Next, I would like to outline the course of future efforts toward strengthening the economy’s competitiveness and growth potential. Capturing increasing overseas demand The first course is to capture increasing overseas demand in the form of expanding Japanese firms’ overseas business activities. It is inappropriate to negatively describe such efforts as the “hollowing-out” of industries in an environment where overseas economies  – mainly emerging economies – have grown much faster than Japan. With regard to international division of labor, while manufacturing and assembly overseas expands, increasing the export of intermediate goods from Japan and reinforcing domestic R&D activity, whose value-added is relatively higher, will contribute to raising Japan’s real GDP. In addition, if surplus funds that have accumulated in the corporate sector are being used for overseas investment with high returns, the benefit of such investment will be passed back to Japan in the form of interests and dividends. This will not directly contribute to raising real GDP, but it does raise real GNI. While globalization of the economy continues, it is deemed imperative to make balanced efforts as a nation by combining domestic production with exports as well as with foreign direct investment, or local production overseas. Indeed, overseas investment by Japanese firms has been increasing, especially in Asia. Such a trend has spread from large manufacturing firms to nonmanufacturing ones, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises (Chart 14). Nevertheless, the outstanding amount of Japan’s foreign direct investment remains at a low level compared with that of other advanced countries (Chart 15). Similarly, in terms of the profitability of foreign investment, which is the combination of portfolio investment and direct investment, Japan falls a little behind countries such as the United States, partly because of its small share of direct investment, which has a high rate of return (Chart 16). Huge potential demand exists in emerging economies, particularly Asia, in the area of building core infrastructure for transportation systems, energy supply, and communication systems. According to the estimates of the Asian Development Bank, such demand will amount to approximately 8 trillion U.S. dollars from 2010 to 2020 (Chart 17). There are ample business opportunities for Japanese firms to make use of their globally recognized cutting-edge technologies and wealth of experience – such as upgrading metropolitan infrastructure and implementing environmental and energy-saving technologies, as well as deploying factory automation systems to address labor shortages and wage rises – that have been nurtured in Japan over the years. It has become increasingly apparent that Japanese firms in such sectors as retail, healthcare, and education, which have focused mainly on the domestic market, are able to formulate sweeping business strategies in large Asian markets, where consumer demand is increasing briskly as these countries’ middle-income populations continue to expand. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Responding to the aging population The second course is to respond to the rapidly aging population. The long average life expectancy of the Japanese people implies that health, the condition most vital to well-being, is being fulfilled at a high level. Having said that, it is necessary to adjust the economic structure and social infrastructure as the population continues to age. Otherwise, it becomes difficult to maintain the current high quality of life. While this is sometimes misunderstood, the demographic change of population aging itself is not triggering the problem for Japan’s economy; the real issue is that Japan’s economic structure and social infrastructure have not sufficiently caught up with such demographic changes. The aging of the population brings about various changes to the economy. First, it will become a downside factor for economic growth via the economy’s supply side – namely, a decline in the labor force. In order to counter this trend, it is most important to increase labor participation, particularly of the elderly and women.3 The labor participation rate of  60–69 year-olds has increased continuously over the last few years (Chart 18). The labor participation rate of women is also increasing, but remains at a relatively low level compared with other advanced economies (Chart 19). Aging will also substantially change the demand structure of the economy. The area of medical and nursing care is one worth mentioning. In the United States, the elderly population aged 65 and older increased by 13 percent in the ten years from 2000, and as a result, the expenditure in medical and nursing care rose by 82 percent. By contrast, in Japan, while the elderly population increased by 29 percent, such expenditure only rose by 17 percent (Chart 20). In relation to this, it has often been pointed out that, in Japan, due to a number of regulations and a shortage in the workforce, sufficient service in this sector has not been provided relative to demand. While one should be mindful of the fiscal implications, appropriate system design and regulatory reforms are likely to turn the potential demand in medical and nursing care, as well as in medical equipment and infrastructure, into actual demand. At the same time, medical and nursing care could become one of the most promising domestic employers as Japanese firms expand their overseas operations (Chart 21).4 Population aging also brings about an expansion in demand in the housing market. For the child-raising generation, potential demand for larger housing is believed to be high, but such demand has not been satisfied, particularly in the metropolitan areas. On the contrary, members of the elderly generation continue to live in large houses that had been acquired during their working age. Indeed, in Japan, the share of second-hand dwellings in the total housing market (i.e., combining new and second-hand dwellings together) is only 12 percent, far less than the 79 percent in the United States and 86 percent in the United Kingdom (Chart 22). Once the housing market is reorganized, potential demand for housing will be cultivated by meeting the different needs in different stages of life, and this will eventually invigorate related markets, such as electric home appliances and other household items, as well as remodeling. Change is also desirable on the financial front. It is often pointed out that, in Japan, household financial assets are concentrated in cash and deposits. This partly reflects that the share of residential assets, that is, real assets with large price fluctuations and low liquidity, among total household assets tends to be high (Chart 23). If household assets start flowing into financial assets other than cash and deposits, we might enjoy an increase in the supply of long-term risk money.                                                 3 For details on the importance of raising the labor participation rate of women, please see Chad Steinberg and Masato Nakane, “Can Women Save Japan?” IMF Working Paper 12/248. International Monetary Fund, 2012. http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12248.pdf 4 In the United States since 1990, while the number of employees in manufacturing has decreased by about 6 million, mainly due to an acceleration in the shift of production overseas, that in the healthcare industry has increased by 6 million. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Promoting smooth transfer of resources The third course is to promote the smooth transfer of resources. In the medical care and housing areas that I just talked about, not a shortfall in demand but the mismatch between demand and supply has become the essence of the problem in the sense that potential demand and actual supply do not correspond to each other. In recent years, sales of pre-packaged tours to the elderly and sales in health-related industries have shown marked increases. This suggests that firms have succeeded in cultivating potential demand by making efforts to develop new products through shifting their human resources and capital to those businesses. Changes will surely create new demand and promote the introduction of new goods and services. It is imperative to realize the optimal resource allocation by shifting labor and capital resources within a firm, as well as among firms, industries, and regions, in accordance with a changing demand structure. In short, the metabolic process is also crucial in achieving economic growth. Looking at the founding years of the top 300 firms in terms of market capitalization, there are more firms with long corporate histories in Japan than in the United States (Chart 24). This is evidence that firms themselves have made efforts to self-transform and have successfully managed to cope with a series of environmental changes. It can also be said that dynamism is absent in terms of birth of firms. Changes are surely taking place, however. For instance, looking at developments in the stock market after the Lehman shock, comparatively small firms have recently been performing relatively well (Chart 25). The number of initial public offerings – which showed a large decline in recent years – is gradually on a recovery trend, and such movements are now also being observed outside large metropolitan areas. I am quite encouraged by this development. IV. Regulatory and institutional reforms, corporate governance reform, and social values So far, I have talked about the outline of the measures toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential. In principle, this should happen in an economy as a result of individual firms’ rational choice. The fact that this is not happening in reality must be the result of economic, institutional, or social factors. Accordingly, there is a need to improve the economic environment, i.e., remove those obstructing factors. Regulatory and institutional reforms First, there needs to be an improvement, promoted by the government, in the environment that will serve to back firms’ efforts aimed at bringing about change. More specifically, it is necessary for the government to carry out bold regulatory reform in order for firms to broaden the areas in which they may embark on new challenges, and to make institutional improvements to the labor market so as to allow workers to move more smoothly into businesses and industries with high growth potential. In order to avoid an increase in excessive social friction arising from responses to changes in the economic environment, it is also necessary to provide support for career changes and to enhance the safety net. Corporate governance reform Second, it is necessary to ensure the appropriate functioning of corporate governance by stockholders and investors.5 On this issue, Germany is a good source of reference. Until the                                                 5 For details on the effects of various legal institutions including corporate governance on corporate profits, please see Nobuyuki Kinoshita, “The Institutional Background to Characteristics of Japanese Firms’ including Low Profitability” (available only in Japanese), IMES Discussion Paper Series 2012-J-12, Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan, 2012. http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/papers/ japanese/12-J-12.pdf 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  beginning of the 2000s, Germany was named as a country putting off essential structural reforms, and the country indeed suffered from slow economic growth in the first half of the 2000s. Under such circumstances, however, it engaged in various reforms surrounding corporate activity, including institutional reforms that allowed for flexible adjustments to employment as well as enhanced information disclosure to investors. On this point, Japan falls behind Germany, especially when it comes to reforming enterprise law in such areas as corporate rehabilitation, as well as mergers and acquisitions. This is said to hinder dynamic corporate restructuring, thereby eroding the international competitiveness of industries across the board. It is also said that such an environment has accentuated the anxiousness over legal liquidation or removed the fear of being taken over, and encouraged to some extent the excessive accumulation of cash and deposits at firms. Social values Third, society needs to face possible trade-offs between stability and change. Japan has been somewhat dominated so far by a perspective that stressed the importance of stability. The method of adding gradual “improvements” to one’s company’s products in accordance with consumer needs in the existing domestic market can be considered a business management style that puts importance on stability. Merely making improvements focused on the domestic market amid a population decline, however, carries the risk of the economy falling into a shrinking cycle. Corporate profits will suffer even more in the long term if firms continue to keenly compete in terms of prices while maintaining their commitment to securing employment. If I may make a sweeping generalization, firms are facing a judgment call of choosing between “improvement”, which represents continuity, and “innovation”, which represents discontinuity. If the shock against the economy is temporary, there may be a point to overcoming any difficulties in the immediate future via “improvements”, thus prioritizing stability in the long term. Confronting long-lasting shocks such as globalization and population aging by means of the same “improvement” as before, however, may delay responses to significant changes. Reform cannot proceed without public consensus. Bringing about innovation requires firms’ willingness to take on challenges as well as the transfer and reallocation of necessary resources. Frictions may well be experienced in the process. While this is not necessarily an issue with one indisputable solution, if environmental change is long-lasting, I find it extremely important for society as a whole to accept such changes and adopt a view that encourages any and all efforts to take on new challenges, in order to successfully carry out reforms toward strengthening growth potential. V. Relationship with prices So far, I have talked about the efforts to strengthen the economy’s competitiveness and growth potential. Next, getting slightly off track, I will touch upon the relationship between economic growth and prices. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) is currently around 0 percent, but is expected to reach 0.9 percent in fiscal 2014, according to the Bank’s forecasts. This is based on the view that Japan’s economy will continue to grow above its potential growth rate and the output gap will be filled, assuming that overseas economies moderately improve. However, considering the fact that the output gap has narrowed significantly compared with its peak, and given the sensitivity of prices to the gap, the closing of the gap alone will not allow us to reach the target of 2 percent right away. What is the general image of an economy that achieved 2 percent inflation, and what is the mechanism behind the process leading up to this state? In theory, one can come up with several cases. The first involves a push from rising import prices as a result of the yen’s depreciation or rising international commodity prices. The second is related to rising wages. In the medium to long term, wages and prices are closely correlated. The third sees rising inflation 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  expectations. Finally, the fourth corresponds with rising growth expectations of firms and households. Which case are we looking for? In the case where import prices push up inflation, household real income is squeezed. The ideal situation is that a rise in wages, a rise in inflation expectations, and a heightening of firms’ and households’ growth expectations take place at the same time. What should be noted here is the relationship between wages and prices. One of the main factors behind low inflation rates in Japan relative to other economies is Japan’s employment practice. Specifically, Japanese society since the second half of the 1990s has prioritized securing employment, and it effected reductions in costs largely by cutting back wages; consequently, prices fell (Chart 26). Looking at development patterns of corporate profits, wages, and prices during economic recovery phases, these three indicators moved together in the same direction during the high-growth era in the 1970s (Chart 27). At present, neither wages nor prices have changed materially even in the economic recovery phase, as corporate profits have acted as a buffer to absorb shocks, with the labor distribution rate rising during economic recession phases and declining during recovery periods. The primary cause for this is the decline in firms’ profitability, which in turn reflects the decline in the potential growth rate. On this point, looking at the relationship between medium- to long-term inflation expectations and potential growth rates, there is a clear positive correlation in Japan (Chart 28). If firms’ and households’ growth expectations improve, this will have a positive effect on wages and prices in a sustainable manner. Consequently, “deflationary expectations” that had taken hold over a prolonged period will fade away. VI. The will to reform While it generally has been recognized that there is a need to work toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential, and that meeting these challenges is essential in overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable growth with price stability, why is it that such efforts have not made progress? On this point, the key lies in the sense of urgency regarding the need for reform. The problems currently facing Japan’s economy, namely, the rapid aging of the population and accompanying issues, are not temporary. They are steadily affecting the economy in the manner of a chronic illness. Deterioration of fiscal conditions is a textbook example of such problems. In order to maintain fiscal sustainability, it is necessary to reform the structure of expenditures and revenues as well as strengthening growth potential. Unless the growth rate rises, a modest increase in the rate of inflation alone will barely improve the fiscal balance. While such chronic symptoms exist in Japan, acute ones have not appeared. The biggest reason for this lies in the fact that Japan holds a massive amount of external net assets reflecting the current account surplus that has continued over a prolonged period. Because of this, Japan tends to experience inflows of capital that search for a safe haven, even in the event of a global economic shock, and enjoy stable long-term interest rates while facing an appreciation of the yen. Japan has not experienced any sell-off of its currency in a crisis. In this regard, I would like to make reference to recent developments in financial markets. The keywords to understanding movements in the global financial markets over the last several years are risk-on and risk-off. When faced with a great amount of uncertainty about the future, investors stay away from risks – in other words, they become risk-off – but when such uncertainty is judged small, they become risk-on (Chart 29). The basic background to the yen’s appreciation that lasted until summer 2012 was investors’ preference for safe assets as the European debt problem intensified. Indeed, it was in late July that the yen hit its recent peak in the nominal effective exchange rate and the Spanish and Italian sovereign rates reached the most elevated levels. After that, a variety of safety valves to cope with the European debt problem were put in place in Europe and the fiscal cliff was avoided in the United States. Against the background of these developments, global investors’ risk aversion has substantially receded. Broadly speaking, the yen’s recent depreciation and rise in stock 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  prices in Japan are also taking place amid such changes in those investors’ risk aversion. Put differently, investors’ attitude toward risk may influence market conditions. I believe this could be easily understood by looking back at the fact that yields on government securities of member states of the euro area had remained at practically the same levels for nearly ten years. What ultimately drives market developments is economic fundamentals. Over the last 15 years in Japan, there were several phases when the yen depreciated. Although exports and production increased during those phases, we regrettably did not succeed in raising the potential growth rate (Charts 30 and 31). The important thing is to make use of the current favorable conditions and make steady efforts to strengthen the competitiveness and growth potential of the economy. VII. Conduct of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan Lastly, I would like to go over the recent monetary policy measures by the Bank of Japan. As I mentioned at the outset, the Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy make progress. Based on this recognition, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held in January, the Bank set and announced the “price stability target” at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. As stated in the Bank of Japan Act, the Bank conducts monetary policy based on the principle that the policy shall be aimed at “achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy”. Put differently, the Bank aims at achieving price stability with which Japan’s economy will grow in a sustainable and balanced manner, and under such a principle, the Bank has been pursuing aggressive monetary easing with the aim of achieving this price stability target at the earliest possible time. The Bank, under the Asset Purchase Program, will additionally purchase financial assets amounting to about 36 trillion yen, mainly JGBs, by the end of this year. Furthermore, from January 2014 onward, it will purchase about 13 trillion yen worth of assets, 2 trillion yen of which will be JGBs, every month without setting any termination date. The Bank is committed to pursuing, without loosening the reins, aggressive monetary easing with the aim of achieving the “price stability target”. Efforts by the government, in parallel with appropriate monetary easing measures, are important in order to overcome deflation early and achieve sustainable growth with price stability, for the following reasons. First of all, if the government’s efforts to strengthen competitiveness and growth potential make progress, economic agents will take further advantage of the accommodative financial conditions and the effects of monetary easing will be increasingly amplified. At present, money, or liquidity that the Bank has been supplying, is increasing significantly; however, prices have not been responding accordingly (Chart 32).6 Private financial institutions have been increasing their government bond holdings rather than lending (Chart 33). On this point, the government has stated its intention to advance structural reform of the economy by making use of all possible decisive policy actions, including carrying out bold regulatory and institutional reforms. The Bank expects that forceful efforts will be forthcoming in this regard. Meanwhile, the Bank itself has established a “Loan Support Program” through which to encourage proactive efforts by firms and financial institutions, using the levers of finance.7                                                 6 On this point, Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve stated during the press conference on December 12, 2012 that “there’s no effect on inflation expectations from the size of our balance sheet”. For details, please see Federal Reserve Board, “Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference”, December 12, 2012. http://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20121212.pdf 7 The Bank established the “Loan Support Program” by integrating the “Growth Supporting Funding Facility” introduced in June 2010 and the “Stimulating Bank Lending Facility” introduced in October 2012. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Together with the aforementioned Asset Purchase Program, the Bank will supply additional funds amounting to over 60 trillion yen in the next two years. The amount outstanding will exceed 130 trillion yen, which is about 30 percent of nominal GDP (Chart 34). While monetary easing by the central bank has a stimulating effect on current economic conditions by bringing forward tomorrow’s demand to today, so to speak, such effect will wane once it becomes tomorrow and unless demand for the day after is brought forward. At any rate, the size of the demand brought forward depends on future growth potential. This makes efforts to raise the potential growth rate itself all the more important. If such efforts by the Bank on the financial side and those by the government to strengthen the growth potential could instigate a virtuous cycle and bring about synergies, the policy effects are likely to be amplified. Second, in order to pursue aggressive monetary easing, ensuring confidence regarding fiscal policy is also important. As part of its monetary easing, the Bank has been purchasing a substantial amount of government bonds. Given the severe fiscal conditions, however, if such purchases were regarded as monetizing government debt in the markets at home and abroad, there is a risk that long-term interest rates would rise. In particular, if efforts to strengthen the growth potential do not make progress and the Bank’s holding of JGBs continues to increase, that risk becomes more imminent. Were this to occur, not only would the effects of monetary easing weaken, but there would also be adverse effects on the real economy through the impacts on the businesses of financial institutions holding a large amount of government bonds.8 In that sense, discipline is expected of both the government and the Bank. Discipline within the Bank is stipulated by the purpose imposed on the central bank, that is, contributing to sustainable growth through price stability and financial system stability. Meanwhile, the government is required to uphold fiscal discipline. On this point, the government stated clearly that it “will steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure with a view to ensuring the credibility of fiscal management”. Once credibility is eroded and the economy falls into a state of confusion, there will be limited room for maneuver by the central bank. Economists generally refer to this kind of situation as “fiscal dominance”. In order to prevent such a situation from materializing, it is important to engage in efforts to achieve fiscal reform, thereby maintaining fiscal discipline in the medium to long term. Final remarks While there is active discussion regarding the conduct of economic policy in Japan, I personally feel there is a need to earnestly discuss what it is that we truly want to achieve when referring to “overcoming deflation”, and what it is that we must carry out in order to accomplish this. The opportunity is right in front of us now. Once we find what we want, we must take action. The Bank will continue to do its utmost toward overcoming deflation early and achieving sustainable growth with price stability. The purpose of the central bank is to lay stable economic and financial foundations that support the sustainable growth of the economy.9 In doing so, it goes without saying that the Bank will thoroughly examine the outlook for economic activity and prices and risk factors to sustainable growth. Independent central                                                 8 On the relationship between fiscal sustainability and financial system stability, as well as price stability, please see Masaaki Shirakawa, “The Importance of Fiscal Sustainability: Preconditions for Stability in the Financial System and in Prices” (Remarks at the Banque de France Financial Stability Review Launch Event in Washington D.C.), April 21, 2012. http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/press/koen_2012/ data/ko120422b.pdf 9 For more on this point, please see Masaaki Shirakawa, “The Roles, Missions, and Challenges of the Central Bank” (Speech at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo), January 25, 2013. http://www.boj.or.jp/ en/announcements/press/koen_2013/data/ko130130a.pdf 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  banks are obviously expected to explain the effects as well as costs of measures in the longer term. I believe this is what accountability means. As the experience of the global credit bubble in the mid-2000s suggests, time and again, the seeds of new problems and unexpected crises have already been sown as authorities respond to a problem. This provides us with a renewed sense of awareness of the importance of humility to learn from history and of stability from a medium- to long-term perspective. The Bank of Japan will continue to listen to a variety of views and conduct monetary policy appropriately on the judgment and under the responsibility of its Policy Board with the aim of overcoming deflation early and achieving sustainable economic growth with price stability. I ask for your continued support. Thank you for your attention.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Christopher Kent: Recent developments in the Australian housing market Address by Mr Christopher Kent, Assistant Governor (Economic) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian Institute of Building, Sydney, 14 March 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank The Australian Institute of Building for the invitation to speak here today and the opportunity to discuss recent developments in the housing market. Housing is important in our lives in many ways, including as a secure place to live, a key asset and an important vehicle for saving. Housing is also a source of employment for a lot of people, including for those in the business of developing, building and renovating, as well as for those who help us to trade and move between dwellings, and oversee the legalities, insurance and financing of housing-related transactions. Hardly surprising then that it’s a frequent topic of conversation, including among economists. And it is not surprising that central bankers pay it close attention, given that it plays an important role in the business cycle, in the transmission of monetary policy and, as we’ve seen in many advanced economies of late, in the health of the financial system. My plan today is to add to this conversation, reviewing what’s been happening over the past year or two and discussing some of the factors affecting the outlook for the Australian housing market. The established housing market Overall, the data over recent months suggest that demand in the established housing market is strengthening gradually, and this should help to underpin further moderate growth in dwelling construction. This general strengthening has been helped, no doubt, by 175 basis points worth of cuts to the cash rate since late 2011, and the decline in mortgage interest rates that has followed from these cuts.1 Apart from a brief period after the onset of the global financial crisis, required mortgage payments on a new home are at the lowest level as a share of disposable income for the past decade (Graph 1). An assessment of what’s been happening to housing prices will depend somewhat on which market you are looking at and over what time period. For the country as a whole, housing prices have been rising gradually since about May 2012, and are now about 4 per cent higher than they were at that time (Graph 2). However, if you were a developer who had made plans and purchased land for development around October 2010, when housing prices last peaked, then you might be forgiven for focusing on the fact that house prices are still below their previous peaks in many locations. In particular, prices are still quite a way below their peak in Brisbane and Melbourne, while prices have been quite flat for a few years in Adelaide and outside of the capital cities in the mainland states. With interest rates low and housing prices having picked up in much of the country, more people are now confident that either housing prices will keep rising or at least not decline. We can see this in some of the available survey measures of housing price expectations. This is important for prospective entrants to the market, particularly for developers and investors, who might otherwise be wary of undertaking a new venture or purchasing a house                                                  1  Standard variable housing loan rates have declined by 135 basis points on average since late 2011, as bank funding costs have risen relative to the cash rate. The Board of the RBA has taken this into account in its monetary policy decisions and as a result, the cash rate is lower than it otherwise would have been. See Lowe P (2012), “What is Normal?”, Address to the Australian Business Economists Annual Dinner, 5 December. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  for fear of a capital loss. But again, not all markets across the country are in the same boat. In Melbourne, for example, there is some question as to whether supply has moved ahead of demand, particularly in the market for apartments in the inner-city area. This possibility is certainly consistent with the fact that prices for houses and units in Melbourne are quite a bit lower than the peaks of early 2011. The general improvement in sentiment is also apparent in auction clearance rates. After falling sharply in 2011, these rates recovered to around average levels in both Sydney and Melbourne in late 2012 and they appear to have increased further early this year. This move may in part have been helped by a tendency of vendors to adopt more realistic expectations, as evidenced by a rise in vendor discounts – that is, the extent to which a property sells below its listed price. These discounts had risen gradually as the market weakened through 2011; more recently, the degree of vendor discounting has returned to more normal levels. Despite the improvement in conditions in the established housing market, turnover remains quite low, at least by comparison with most of the previous decade (Graph 3). However, it may be that the experience of that era is not the right comparison. Perhaps we shouldn’t expect to see turnover sustained at those very high rates again. If that is right, it means that those who make a living from turnover – real estate agents being the most obvious example – are unlikely to see a return to the easier days of the first half of the previous decade. Financing Over the past 20 years or so, upturns in the housing market have been accompanied by an increase in the growth rate of credit. But those years were also a period of structural change as the economy moved to a higher level of household indebtedness (Graph 4). Generations of households yet to buy their first home, or still wanting to trade up, were taking advantage of easier access to credit, which among other things had been facilitated by the shift to lower inflation and lower interest rates in the early 1990s.2 As part of this change, the household saving rate declined and housing prices increased, at times quite rapidly. With household indebtedness no longer moving up since 2006, this long period of adjustment now seems to have run its course. Indeed, in recent years we have seen a rise in the household saving rate and relatively stable household debt as a share of income. This suggests that we should not expect housing credit to grow anywhere near as rapidly as it had in previous upturns. Moreover, while the recent pick-up in housing prices would tend to imply growth in housing loans – since buyers typically fund those purchases with debt – this effect will be lessened by the low level of turnover in the established housing market. Even so, the availability of credit does not appear to be a constraint for most homebuyers and investors. The decline in mortgage interest rates since 2011 has underpinned a moderate increase in the value of total housing loan approvals over the past six months (Graph 5). This has been driven by demand from repeat-buyer owner-occupiers as well as investors.3 Despite the moderate pick-up in new lending, growth in housing credit has not increased significantly and remains broadly in line with growth in incomes at an annual rate of around 4½ per cent. Lower interest rates have given households more scope to make payments on                                                  2  For further detail on the adjustment to a higher level of household indebtedness, see Bloxham P, C Kent and M Robson (2010), “Asset Prices, Credit Growth, Monetary and Other Policies: An Australian Case Study”, RBA Research Discussion Paper 2010–06. 3  Discerning the strength of demand from first home buyers has been complicated by recent changes to government grants and tax exemptions. These changes have significantly increased the assistance for purchasing new dwellings relative to established dwellings in some states.

We can see this effect in the behaviour of owner-occupier housing credit. From early 2012, shortly after mortgage rates started to decline, owner-occupier housing credit has been growing at a slower pace than investor housing credit (Graph 6). This makes sense because the incentive to make excess mortgage payments is greater for owner-occupiers than investors given the different tax incentives they face. While finance is available to households on relatively favourable terms, some developers continue to report difficulties in obtaining finance for new construction, with banks requiring a higher proportion of pre-sales than was typical prior to the global financial crisis. According to the Reserve Bank’s industry liaison, large developers that have a good reputation and a strong balance sheet have access to credit, while small developers have tended to experience more difficulty in borrowing funds. Dwelling investment The availability and relatively low cost of finance for home purchasers combined with improving conditions in the established housing market have been supporting dwelling construction in recent quarters. The expectation is that dwelling investment will continue to pick up from here. However, it is hard to know how strong this pick-up is likely to be. Private residential building approvals, though volatile, have picked up noticeably from their trough in early 2012 (Graph 7). This recovery has been driven by an increase in higher-density approvals, mainly apartments, and was seen in all the larger states. Across almost every major region in Sydney, building approvals since mid-2012 have been higher than they were in the previous five years (Graph 8). In Melbourne approvals have also picked up, though by somewhat less and not across all regions. There has been some pick-up in approvals in Western Australia, although changes in building approvals processes in that state around the middle of last year have made it more difficult to discern the underlying trends. Approvals in Queensland have been subdued, particularly on the Gold Coast and in the south-east of the state more generally; however, even builders in that region have indicated to us that there are tentative signs of some improvement in demand more recently. While building approvals for higher-density housing have picked up, as yet there has been little sign of a rise in approvals for detached houses.4 Indeed, building approvals for detached houses are currently at levels seen during the low points of previous cyclical downturns, while approvals for higher-density housing are at, or even above, previous cyclical peaks. This may be an early indication of a new trend in the housing market. There are a number of reasons why this might be so. First, as the price of land has increased relative to incomes over the past few decades, it makes sense that there is an incentive to economise on the use of land – that is, by living in higher-density housing. Second, it may be that the utility of living in detached houses on the fringes of many cities has decreased with increased congestion and the difficulties of travelling into cities to access job and other opportunities there. The third and closely related possibility is that there may have been a shift in people’s preferences towards living closer to the centre of cities and the existing infrastructure there. In any case, if this is a durable, structural change in the market, it will have important implications for builders and developers, particularly those whose business model is focused on detached housing. To understand what the strength of the increase in overall residential construction activity is likely to be, it is helpful to take a step back from the most recent few months’ worth of data                                                  4  Also, alterations and additions have continued to fall. The low level of dwelling turnover may help to explain some of the weakness in the level of renovation activity. This is because when people are selling their dwelling, or have bought a dwelling, they often undertake work of this sort. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  and look at developments over a longer period. The thing that really stands out over the past few years is that, despite the recent pick-up, dwelling investment as a share of the economy remains close to the troughs of over a decade ago (Graph 9). This relatively low level of dwelling construction raises the question of whether demand has been particularly weak or whether supply issues have constrained construction activity. Factors affecting the supply of land for development will obviously have an important bearing on the cost of new housing, and the speed with which any increase in demand for housing can be accommodated by a rise in construction. I’ll come back to a discussion of some of these factors in just a minute. But the key point I want to make is that whatever these supply-side constraints might be, they don’t seem to have prevented an increase in construction across much of the country in 2009 and 2010. At that time, a general increase in incentives for first home buyers (for both new and existing dwellings), and the support provided for a time by lower interest rates, led to a sharp run-up in construction in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia (Graph 10). Further evidence that the supply of land is not the whole story can be found by looking across different regions within the states. If supply has been the critical constraint, we might have expected construction trends to have been very different across inner and outer parts of cities and the regional areas beyond the cities. For example, development in the outer suburbs tends to be on greenfield land, while development in the inner suburbs tends to be higher-density dwellings on brownfield land. However, for Victoria at least, the pick-up in building activity in 2009 and 2010 was relatively broad based across these different areas (Graph 11). For New South Wales, it does appear that there was a larger and more sustained pick-up in approvals in the inner and middle regions of Sydney, than in outer Sydney and the rest of the state. This may have reflected some limitations in access to land on Sydney’s fringes, but nonetheless, there was a relatively rapid pick-up in approvals in 2009. Even so, this doesn’t mean that supply-side issues have not had an important bearing on the housing sector. This point was made in research published in one of the Bank’s Bulletin articles last year.5 Many public reports and the Bank’s own liaison with industry participants pointed to a range of supply-side impediments in the Australian housing market. These included the length and complexity of the planning process, the provision and funding of infrastructure, land ownership and geographical constraints, as well as the challenges for development within those city regions that are already well developed. While these factors may impose some constraints on the cost and responsiveness of new supply, it is less clear that they have been restraining the level of new construction more so now than in the past. One way that is often used to assess the possible outlook for dwelling construction is to compare the number of dwellings that have been built over a period of time with a measure of what is termed “underlying demand”. The notion is that if we can assess the prospects for the average number of people living in each household, then we can gauge the strength of “underlying demand” by looking at what’s happening to population growth. The problem with this sort of analysis is that the average number of people in each household changes over time in response to a range of things, including the cost of housing. Over the 20th century, demographic and social factors, such as a declining birth rate and rising separation rate, were accommodated by growth in the dwelling stock outpacing that of the population. In other words, there was a downward trend in the number of people in each household (Graph 12). A very similar change was also evident across advanced economies. However, over the past decade or so, these trends have abated and we’ve seen the average household size stabilise. Indeed, the higher level of house prices and rents (relative to                                                  5  See Hsieh W, D Norman and D Orsmond (2012), “Supply-side Issues in the Housing Sector”, RBA Bulletin, September, pp 11–19. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  incomes) may have been somewhat of a constraint on household formation and therefore demand for new housing. This leads me to what I think is arguably a better way to judge the strength of demand versus supply, which is to look at what prices and rents have been doing. What this suggests is that demand has shown some signs of strengthening relative to supply. In particular, housing prices are no longer declining relative to incomes (Graph 13). Also, the rental market appears to be relatively tight. Vacancy rates have been quite low since 2006 in comparison to the average since the early 1990s, and (with a small delay) this has led to rents rising relative to incomes and remaining relatively stable at around levels seen during previous cyclical peaks (Graph 14). The growth in rents has also meant that conditions for investors have become more favourable, with (gross) rental yields increasing across the capital cities. Our liaison with the housing industry confirms that demand for new housing has been more positive over recent months. At the same time, however, our contacts note that conditions still remain relatively subdued in most states. In particular, they report that prices for the construction of new dwellings have been held down in response to weak demand, with discounting still reported across the market, including for new developments. Not surprisingly, developers have found a lack of buyer urgency during the earlier period of declining dwelling prices. In addition, they note instances of some earlier sales made off the plan falling through ahead of settlement, apparently due to caution by lenders regarding valuations and strict lending practices for new developments. Summary Let me conclude then by drawing some of these threads together. A range of indicators suggest that low interest rates have been supporting the established housing market, and prices have been moving higher in many markets, though they remain below earlier peaks in most. Also, finance is available on reasonable terms for households. With these conditions in place, dwelling construction is beginning to pick up and leading indicators point to further growth in the months ahead. In line with this, our expectation is that there will be a further gradual increase in dwelling construction activity over this year and the next. This moderate growth in dwelling investment will play some role in helping to support a gradual pick-up in economic growth more broadly from what is expected to be a rate a little below trend this year. But it is hard to know exactly how strong the recovery in the housing market might be, so we’ll continue to analyse these developments closely over the period ahead.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Luis M Linde: International financial integration and fragmentation. Drivers and policy responses Opening remarks by Mr Luis M Linde, Governor of the Bank of Spain, at the Conference on “International financial integration and fragmentation. Drivers and policy responses”, organized by the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee and the Bank of Spain, Madrid, 12 March 2013. *      *      * Good morning to all. Buenos dias a todos y bienvenidos a Madrid: It is for me a pleasure to welcome you to Banco de España and to this Seminar on international financial integration. I would like to start by thanking Marc Uzan and the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee for their fruitful cooperation in organizing an agenda that is indeed very promising. More than five years into the crisis, it is still hard to grasp the real magnitude of the changes that our financial systems are undergoing. In fact, we are still trying to restore the financial channels to support the growth of internal and external demand. While we perform such, so to say, “fire-fighter task”, it is not easy to take a step back and look at how the contours of our economic and financial landscape are evolving. But we can already distinguish some of the characteristics of the new scenario that is taking shape, and that will be our habitat as central bankers, regulators, financial intermediaries or analysts in the years to come. It seems that one trend is towards disintermediation and a more important role of capital markets, gaining ground to banks, in a global financial system that will probably end up being smaller and more attuned to the size of the global economy. Another trend points to a reduction of financial linkages between national financial systems, as BIS banking statistics, for example, are starting to show. Here, the role of Central Banks’ policies and operations, as well as regulators is crucial, as they must walk a fine line in promoting domestic financial stability without falling into the nets of protectionism, something that would be indeed damaging for growth and prosperity. As we all know, the risk of fragmentation and re-nationalisation of the financial system has materialized at the European level, in the unique institutional context of European Monetary Union; and the solutions to overcome this situation are changing the foundations of the euro. Each of the three sessions which make up the programme will focus on a particular perspective on how the new trends are shaping the global financial system. The crisis and the policy response – in the areas of financial regulation and monetary policy – are generating new patterns of funding, new players and changes in capital flows across global markets. Those issues will be reviewed in the initial session. As I mentioned before, the euro area has to deal with a severe crisis which has led to the fragmentation of the European financial system. While there are signs of a certain reversal in this process, a failure in this respect would be particularly harmful for the European project, since integration is at the core of the European Union itself. The policy actions of the ECB and other European authorities, including the decisive drive towards a Banking Union, have been able to overcome or dissipate the worst fears, but the road ahead is still long and difficult. Finally, the role of central bankers should be highlighted in this new context. We are big players in the financial arena, both from the regulatory and monetary policy standpoint; and the framework for our actions – and reactions – must necessarily change and adapt to the new environment. The renewal of the set of instruments to address the price stability

The need to take on board financial stability considerations is another aspect widely discussed. You will devote the final part of the day to this quest. And I do not want to take more time out of the tight agenda you will follow now. Thank you very much for your attendance to this Conference. I wish all of you and excellent day and a good discussion.   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Pongpen Ruengvirayudh: Challenges in the rotating world Keynote address by Ms Pongpen Ruengvirayudh, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Thomson Reuters FX Awards Ceremony 2013, Bangkok, 27 March 2013. *    *    * Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1. It is an honour for me to join the Thomson Reuters 2013 FX Awards Ceremony today. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the winners of the FX awards this year and to thank all market participants, as well as Thomson Reuters, for your contribution to the development of the Thai foreign exchange market. For the winners of the awards this year, one is reminded that the awards are given not only for the outstanding achievement on business grounds, but also as recognition of the notable efforts in enhancing market efficiency. So a hearty congratulation for a job well done! 2. As you know, much has happened over the past few years, both at the global level and within the Thai economy. The global economy has shown signs of improvements, although in a measured pace, but reactions from the financial markets seem to run ahead of developments on the grounds. For many of us who have seen the global economy and financial markets over many business cycles, such euphoria and exuberance can be expected whenever global risk sentiments improve and investment strategy shifts toward more risk- taking. Today, a new theme or the so-called “The Great Rotation”, has taken the center stage. However, such turnaround may lead to new concerns and challenges going forward. Today’s event thus provides an opportune occasion for us to deliberate and exchange views on this topical issue. 3. Although latest economic data point to stronger growth momentum and smaller tail risks, uncertainty and short-term threats still remain. For example, the situation in Europe can easily come back to take centre stage thus providing a reality check and a pointed reminder that structural problems take time to resolve. Besides, anti-austerity pressure could delay ongoing reform efforts. This may, from time to time, raise uncertainty and spark volatility in the market. Meanwhile, improving economic outlook in the US needs to be tempered with reality of the fiscal drag and the near-term risk from spending cuts which can come back to hit market sentiment. Thus, we should proceed with care since the market has somewhat overly priced in the global recovery story. 4. The challenges from the great rotation can be viewed in two dimensions. First, risk preference has shifted from safety to riskier assets with the improved global sentiment. Particularly, global stock markets have rallied far beyond the modest global recovery. This can be seen in the MSCI World Index which surged by almost 25% during the last 9 months while global growth remains at low level. 5.  Rallies in stock prices on the back of over optimistic sentiment may sow the seeds of potential bubble. Although the market realizes that a further rise in the asset price would virtually compress yield, the market appears to be less concern about a bubble in asset prices. Therefore, there is a risk of a sharp correction which we all witnessed in the recent episode in the Thai stock market last week. 6.  The second dimension of the great rotation is the global fund flow, which is one of the greatest challenges emerging markets are experiencing. The continued monetary easing in advanced economies, economic growth differential and protracted low interest rate environment are key factors pushing investors to search for yield; fund flows have therefore switched from advanced to emerging economies. 7. This second dimension of the great rotation is a concern to policymakers in the region and has called for wider public discussions among academics, businesses and policymakers. Discussion typically centred on the potential recourse to macroprudential or 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  unconventional measures on the part of recipient countries, given that such practice has been adopted by the source countries of the fund flows. As market participants, we all recognize the benefits of capital inflows that provide a two way view for the market, thus adding depth and breadth to emerging financial markets. Therefore any considerations on the use of capital flows policies need to be carefully thought out with consideration of potential unintended consequences and impacts. Needless to say, there is greater acceptance for these measures to be part of the toolkit of the authorities and central banks are continually monitoring the markets and ready to take actions in cooperation with regulators and market participants. 8. To respond to the surge in inflows, the BOT has chosen the route of capital account liberalization as the most natural counter to encourage the outward flows of capital. We believe that this measure will help lessen the pressure from the rotating fund flows as well as provide the opportunity for Thai enterprises to secure new markets in preparation for the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). The roadmap includes relaxation in outward direct investment and portfolio investment. In addition, the BOT has allowed Thai corporates to issue foreign exchange denominated bonds domestically. There is no reason why a reputable Thai corporate should have to go oversea to secure funding if they are well known domestic household names that can mobilize funds at a more attractive rate domestically. Hence, the rotation in fund flow will be taken place at both ends; thereby balancing Out-In with In–Out flows. 9. Against the backdrop of a rotating world, the financial industry is confronted with tighter regulation. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 the world has been thrown in a global recession for half a decade. During this time the debate on financial reregulation has raged from public outcry over bonus compensation of bank CEOs to reregulation of financial services in the form of Basle III, Dodd Frank and similar regulations across the Atlantic. Under the current course, the trend towards tightened financial regulation is not likely to be reversed and we would all have to live to more regulation, though much of the new regulations were cure for diseases that were contracted elsewhere. 10. When speaking about financial regulation, I am reminded of the issue of transparency and governance. The investigation into the LIBOR scandal in major global financial centres and the consequent pursuit of similar investigation in regional financial centres point to the need for greater attention to market conducts. As market confidence is critical to the development of financial markets, any scandals may derail and set us back in the development process. We therefore have a duty to oversee that our markets function in a fair and transparent manner, to safeguard the reputation and trust of the users of financial services. In the past few years, the Bank of Thailand, with the help of key market participants, have put a great effort to promote our own reference rate – the BIBOR, so we have an interest to see that the market is transparent and inspire confidence among the users. 11. To enhance market conduct, the BoT in collaboration with the ACI are considering a code of conduct for FX dealers and brokers. This would institute a process by which these businesses, which are important infrastructure in the Thai foreign exchange market, are given attention and importance to ensure that they contribute to building confidence and trust. 12. In conclusion, let me congratulate once again the winners of this year’s FX Award. Let me also thank Thomson Reuters again for inviting me today. With the support and continued cooperation from all side, the Thai financial markets would continue to press on with the reform efforts that have been made over the years. These improvement will help raise the standard of practice and ensure that our financial market continue to make a positive contribution to the growth and development of the Thai economy which is the ultimate goal for sustainable development. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Deepak Mohanty: Efficacy of monetary policy rules in India Speech by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Delhi School of Economics, Dehli, 25 March 2013. *      *      * The assistance provided by Abhiman Das and Binod Bhoi in preparation of this paper is acknowledged. I thank Professor Pami Dua for the opportunity to interact with this distinguished gathering of professors and young scholars. The Delhi School of Economics has a formidable reputation world over in teaching and research in economics. I will be speaking on the subject of monetary policy rules, not only because it relates to my area of work, but it offers considerable scope for research. My scheme of presentation is as follows. First, I begin by giving you a snapshot of the evolution of monetary framework in India to contextualise how short-term interest rate has emerged as the key operating objective of monetary policy. Second, I briefly focus on the debate on rule versus discretion in the conduct of monetary policy. Third, I present simple Taylor rule estimates for India covering the recent period of 2001–2013 reflecting greater use of interest rate as an instrument of monetary policy. I will conclude with some thoughts on the way forward. Monetary policy operations Let me briefly highlight the evolution of monetary policy operating framework in India, to place our discussion on interest rate rules in perspective. In India, as in most countries, monetary policy framework has evolved in response to and as a consequence of financial developments, openness and shifts in the underlying transmission mechanism. The evolution of monetary policy framework in India can be seen in phases. In the formative years during 1935–1950, the focus of monetary policy was to regulate the supply of and demand for credit in the economy through the bank rate, reserve requirements and open market operations (OMO). In the development phase during 1951–1970, monetary policy was geared towards supporting plan financing. This led to introduction of several quantitative control measures to contain consequent inflationary pressures. While ensuring credit to preferred sectors, the bank rate was often used as a monetary policy instrument. During 1971–90, the focus of monetary policy was on credit planning. Both the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) were used to balance government financing and the attendant inflationary pressure. Subsequently, structural reforms and financial liberalisation in the 1990s shifted the financing paradigm for the government and commercial sectors with increasingly market-determined interest rates and exchange rate. By the second half of the 1990s, in its liquidity management operations, the Reserve Bank was able to move away from direct instruments to indirect market-based instruments. Starting in April 1999, the Reserve Bank introduced a full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (LAF). It was operated through overnight fixed rate repo and reverse repo in November 2004. This process helped to develop interest rate as an instrument of monetary transmission. This framework was reinforced in May 2011 when the weighted average overnight call money rate was explicitly recognised as the operating target of monetary policy and the repo rate was made the only one independently varying policy rate (Mohanty, 2011)1.                                                  1 Mohanty, Deepak (2011): “How does the Reserve Bank of India conduct its Monetary Policy?” Reserve Bank of India Bulletin, September. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Chart 1: The new LAF framework is based on explicit interest rate targeting   The new operating framework illustrated in Chart 1 with the modified LAF assigns a greater weight to the interest rate channel of monetary transmission. This means that once the Reserve Bank changes policy repo rate, it should quickly impact the overnight interest rate which is the operational rate and then transmit through the term structure of interest rates as well as bank lending rates. Increasing importance of this channel was also evident from the mix of instruments of policy actions. Over the years, in comparison with CRR, the use of interest rate instruments such as the Repo rate by the Reserve Bank has been more frequent, except for the year 2008–09, which was the peak of the global financial crisis (Chart 2).  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Rule versus discretion As the Reserve Bank has started explicitly targeting overnight interest rate as the operational objective with the instrument of policy repo rate, there are relevant questions those arise: How that interest rate should be determined? Should it broadly follow a rule or should it be based on the central bank’s discretion? The debate about rule versus discretion is as old as monetary economics. This issue received added impetus as the monetary system transited from gold standard to fiat money. When Kydland and Prescott (1977) in their seminal article presented the time inconsistency argument in favour of rules, the debate became even sharper2. Subsequently, Taylor (1993) demonstrated how even in the practical world of monetary policy making, the monetary policy reaction function could be modeled as predetermined rules with superior policy outcome3. Let me briefly touch upon the pros and cons of rule-based monetary policy before turning to the formulation of Taylor rule. A number of reasons have been advanced in the literature as to why rule-based monetary policy could be more effective. First, a rule towards a credible commitment by the central bank to maintain price stability can reduce the inflation bias from monetary policy. Second, rules enhance economic efficiency by reducing uncertainty about future policy. Third, rules help policymakers avoid pressures from special interest groups and facilitate action consistent with long-run goals. Fourth, rules facilitate communication, promote transparency and increase accountability. Similarly, there are arguments against application of rules. First, the economic system is too complex to be characterized by any rule. Second, the same rule may not work over the business cycle. Third, rule-based policy reduces the flexibility to respond to exogenous shocks. Fourth, rules do not allow for policy surprises which may be desirable for policy effectiveness under certain circumstances. Fifth, rules are ill suited to developing economies characterized by underdeveloped financial markets and rapid structural transformation. In practice, it is difficult to come across central banks, which explicitly spell out their policy rules. However, for modern central banks, empirical assessments and policy evaluations are increasingly based on rules ever since Taylor’s influential paper. In empirical work, original Taylor rule is modified and extended in a variety of ways for adapting to specific country set up and evolving monetary framework. These include forward-looking Taylor rule, Taylor-McCallum type rule, non-linear framework for addressing asymmetric behavior of monetary policy and time-varying nature of its parameters. Taylor rule Taylor rule is an interest rate feedback rule for a central bank for setting short-term interest rates to achieve both its objectives of stabilizing the economy and achieving price stability as economic conditions fluctuate. This could be expressed as:                                                  2 Kydland, Finn and E. Prescott (1977): “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans”, Journal of Political Economy, 85 (3), 473–492. 3 Taylor, J.B. (1993): “Discretion versus policy rules in practice”, Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 39, 195–214. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The rule recommends that short-term interest rate should be changed according to the deviation of inflation from its predetermined target and output from its potential level. Essentially, the combination of inflation and output gap should determine what should be the appropriate policy rate that would return the economy to its potential level without causing inflation. If these goals are in conflict in the sense that inflation is above its target and the economy is growing below its potential or vice versa, the rule provides guidance on how to balance these competing considerations in setting an appropriate level for the policy interest rate. While β and γ could be estimated from data, Taylor assumed those as 0.5 each. In a sense it assigns equal weights to both inflation and growth objectives. This is a reasonable assumption considering that most central banks are concerned both with inflation and growth. These dual objectives are built into many central bank statutes, including that of the US. He also additionally assumed that desired level of inflation for the US was 2 per cent per annum and the equilibrium real policy rate was 2 per cent per annum. Taylor (1993) showed that a simple monetary policy rule, where the US Fed raises the interest rate if inflation rate exceeds a 2 per cent implicit target or if real GDP growth is higher than its potential, describes quite well the actual path of the Fed funds rate between 1987 and 1992. The linear framework of Taylor rule is, however, criticized by many on the ground that central banks have asymmetric preferences for interest rate smoothing depending on the direction of their monetary policy stance. In addition to changes between discretionary and rule-based policy regimes, economic theory provides several reasons for deviating sometimes from a symmetric and linear policy rule framework (Gerlach, 2000)4. An accepted way of representing such behaviour in literature is to assume that actual interest rate it gradually adjusts to the desired rate as: ίt = ρit-1 +(1-ρ) ίt*, where  captures the observed smoothing of the policy rate by the central bank, i.e., the smoothing parameter. Substituting this in the original Taylor rule formulation in (1), the modified Taylor rule with smoothing takes the form as:  It may be noted that equation (2) is not linear in parameters and hence parameters ρ, α, β and γ are estimated from the observed data by non-linear least square method.                                                  4 Gerlach, S., (2000): “Asymmetric Policy Reactions and Inflation”, Working Paper, Bank for International Settlements. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Estimates for India In India there has not been much research on monetary policy rules partly because the underlying monetary framework largely relied on direct and quantity based instruments. Moreover, the commercial interest rate structure was highly regulated till recently. In the Indian context, Singh (2010) estimated Taylor rule using annual data for the period  1950–2009 and observed a shift in policy response towards inflation gap since the 1990s.5 Patra and Kapur (2012) estimated a forward-looking exchange rate augmented Taylor rule and found a high degree of interest rate smoothing.6  Empirical estimation of Taylor Rule will require a priori determination of three parameters: the desired level of inflation, potential output and equilibrium real policy rate. These parameters are country-specific, and hence need to be estimated. First, in the mid-1980s the Chakravarty Committee (1985)7 had suggested a tolerable level of inflation of 4.0 per cent per annum to facilitate changes in relative prices necessary to attract resources to growth sectors. The Reserve Bank’s current assessment suggests that the threshold level of inflation for India is in the range of 4.4–5.7 per cent, implying a mid-point rate of 5.0 per cent (Subbarao, 2013).8 Drawing on the research in the Reserve Bank, the desired level of inflation rate in terms of year-on-year variation in the wholesale price index (WPI) is assumed at 5.0 per cent. The actual inflation rate, however, has remained above this threshold level in the post-crisis period (Chart 3). Chart 3: Inflation in the post-crisis period has remained above the desired rate                                                   5 Singh, Bhupal (2010): “Monetary Policy behaviour in India: Evidence from Taylor-Type Policy Frameworks”, Reserve Bank of India, Staff Study, SS (DEAP): 2/2010. 6 Patra, M.

6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Second, the potential output growth is estimated by using the Hordrick-Prescott (HP) filter. The estimated potential output is broadly comparable to the Reserve Bank’s assessment that India’s potential output may have dropped from 8.5 per cent during the high growth phase of 2003–08 to 8.0 per cent in the post-crisis period to around 7.0 per cent in 2012–13 (Chart 4). Chart 4: Potential output is estimated to have been moderated in the post-crisis period  Third, the determination of the neutral real policy rate is a complex issue as it is not observed in real time. One way is to derive it from a comprehensive general equilibrium model of the Indian economy. Another simpler, though not very satisfactory, way of deriving it is from the Taylor rule estimate itself. The empirical estimate from the two alternatives of Taylor rule estimated by us suggests it to be in the range of 0.5–0.9 per cent covering a longer period from 2000–01:Q1 to 2012–13:Q3 which encompassed the recent bout of high inflation. The implicitly derived number from the high growth and low inflation phase of 2003–08 works out to 1.1 per cent per annum (Table 1). For the purpose of this exercise we have assumed it to be 1 per cent. Combined with our first assumption of desired level of inflation of 5.0 per cent, it will imply that the neutral nominal policy rate could be assumed around 6.0 per cent per annum.

Figures in brackets are standard deviations.  Following these three key assumptions, empirical analysis is done in two stages. In the first stage, we have estimated the Taylor rule from the observed data with and without interest rate smoothing. In the second stage, we have simply used the original Taylor Rule assuming inflation and output gap coefficients at 0.5 each. Our empirical analysis is based on quarterly observations from 2000–01:Q1 to 2012–13:Q3 with average overnight call money rate as the measure of short-term interest rate. The results suggest greater weight on inflation, evident from the level of statistical significance and correctness of the sign of the parameters, in the standard formulation. But interest smoothing becomes dominant in the alternative formulation alongside a significant weight on inflation. In this formulation, although the output gap has the expected sign, it turns out to be statistically insignificant. However, the explanatory power of the equation improves substantially as compared with the standard formulation (Table 2).  Table 2: Parameter estimates of Taylor rule Equation ρ α r* β γ R2 1. Estimated Standard Taylor rule -- 4.68 (0.00) 0.93 0.25 (0.02) –0.26(0.05) 0.21 2.

(ii) Desired inflation rate (π*) = 5%.  (iii) Potential output estimated by HP filter.  (iv) r* = α + (β-1) πt* for given values of desired level of inflation at πt*. Note: Figures in bracket indicate p-values.   Given the estimated neutral rate of interest, desirable inflation rate and potential output growth, we have calculated the level of interest rate implied by the standard Taylor rule with equal weight of 0.5 to both inflation and output gap. The trend in estimated interest rate implied by Taylor rule showed periods of significant departure from the actual call money rate trajectory. But the deviation was more pronounced in the post crisis period which has since been narrowed in 2012–13. Interestingly, there was close correspondence between the 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches implied Taylor rule interest rate and actual overnight call money interest rates during the high growth phase of 2003–08 (Chart 5). Chart 5: Greater divergence in interest rate post-crisis  We also compare another measure of gap: interest rate gap as the difference between quarterly average overnight call rate and interest rate obtained from the Taylor rule, and inflation gap as the difference between quarterly average inflation rate and target inflation (Chart 6). It showed statistically significant inverse correlation which implies that higher the deviation of policy rate from that implied by the simple Taylor rule, higher is the deviation of inflation from its desired level.9                                                   9 Correlation coefficient of –0.78 which was statistically significant at 1 per cent. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 Chart 6: Interest rate gap mirrored inflation gap  Moreover, in the crisis period, the gap had widened which has since narrowed in 2012–13. Additional diagnostics suggested bi-directional causality between the interest rate gap and inflation gap. It is noteworthy that this gap was narrower during the high growth phase of 2003–08. Conclusion Let me conclude. The Taylor rule has been extensively used to understand the interest rate setting behaviour of central banks across the world. Recent empirical work including the simple characterisation I have presented here suggests that a Taylor-type rule could be a useful additional tool in understanding the interrelationship among growth, inflation and policy interest rate as the interest rate channel of monetary transmission strengthens. At the same time, it should be emphasised that Taylor rule has its limitations as exclusive emphasis on interest rates with the neglect of other variables may not be optimal for an emerging market economy like India. In my presentation if I have raised more questions than provide answers, I would have succeeded in my intention. There is a need for further research to enhance our understanding of appropriate interest rate structure which is conducive to price stability in the medium- to long-term. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Glenn Stevens: Financial regulation – Australia in the global landscape Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Annual Forum, Sydney, 26 March 2013. *      *      * The title of this session is “Australia as a Global Citizen”. Accordingly, I will seek to set financial and regulatory developments in Australia in a global setting. This is worth doing for its own sake, since local discussion is better informed if we can see how the various initiatives fit in to the broader setting. It is also important to remember that Australia, along with all other jurisdictions that sign up to international standards, will be evaluated by our peers. So it’s worth spelling out our approach to some key issues. In addition, from the end of this year Australia will have responsibility for chairing the G20 for a year, and financial reform and regulation have been prominent on the G20’s agenda in recent years. So Australia’s political leadership will have some responsibility for shaping, for a brief period, the oversight of the process. It is worth starting to think about how this might be done. As a “global citizen”, Australia has the responsibilities and rights of that “citizenship”. The responsibilities are to uphold and play by the rules that are globally agreed, which include implementing global standards in regulation and oversight, and encouraging others to do so. The rights we have are the same as those of others: to have our say and to play our own part, however modest and small, in the development of those standards. Something that is a bit new and, overall, refreshing is that Australia actually does have a place at more of the relevant tables than it used to. ASIC has long been a member of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) as were its predecessor organisations the ASC and the NCSC. It is quite a feather in the cap for ASIC that its chair has this month assumed the chair of the IOSCO Board. The expanded membership of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) now allows Australia two members – APRA, naturally, and the Reserve Bank – where we had none before. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) likewise allows us two seats, compared with one previously, and membership of some of the key committees. The international financial landscape In the wake of the crisis that swept Europe and North America, the international regulatory environment for the financial system has changed significantly. An expanded Financial Stability Board, with the political backing of the G20 Leaders, has acted to coordinate this process, working with existing standard-setting bodies and also by developing its own processes. There have been several main streams to the reforms. The first is the Basel III prudential reforms, which aim to improve the resilience of financial institutions by strengthening capital and liquidity requirements. Compared with Basel II, minimum capital ratios are higher, capital has been defined more strictly to refer to genuinely loss-absorbing instruments, and use of counter-cyclical capital add-ons is contemplated, all supplemented by a simple constraint on overall leverage. More attention is focused on liquidity management by banks. The second key stream of work has aimed to address the problem of “too big to fail”. Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) have been identified, and capital surcharges will be set to strengthen their resilience, beginning in 2016. Cross-border crisis-management groups have been established for nearly all of these institutions, and one of their key tasks is to review the recovery and resolution plans that are being developed for these firms. Intensity of 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  supervision is also being increased. For domestic systemically important banks, a principles-based regulatory framework has been developed. While banks have been the major focus thus far, the overall policy framework for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) applies more broadly, and an identification methodology is close to being finalised for global systemically important insurers. A third element is aimed at improving the functioning of markets for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, so as to reduce risk of contagion in the financial system. This is to be achieved by promoting or mandating central clearing of standardised OTC derivatives contracts, and adding to transparency through requiring trade reporting. A fourth stream is aimed at addressing risks arising from shadow banking – that is, those entities and activities outside the regulated banking system that are associated with credit intermediation and maturity transformation. The FSB released key proposals last year for consultation and they are being refined on the basis of feedback received, for consideration at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in September 2013. What has Australia done? Australia was not as badly affected by the crisis as some other countries. Our banking system overall, though hardly without blemish, stood up fairly well. This was testament to generally sound management in most institutions and a robust supervisory approach. But there were still lessons to be drawn for Australia and the regulators here have given careful thought to them and to the associated global reforms. APRA finalised its prudential standards to implement the Basel III capital standards in late 2012. Australia, along with 10 other jurisdictions, adopted the capital elements of Basel III as from 1 January this year. Some major jurisdictions – the EU and the US in particular – are a little behind, though all the BCBS member jurisdictions had at least released draft regulations by mid-February. Australia is considered an “early adopter” of the Basel III reforms. Given the relatively healthy capital positions of authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), APRA is requiring ADIs to meet a number of the main capital measures two or three years earlier than the rather extended timetable required under Basel III and it is not using the discretion available under Basel III to provide a concessional treatment for certain items in calculating regulatory capital (e.g. deferred tax assets).1 APRA has also moved ahead on the liquidity standard, in conjunction with the Reserve Bank. We have established the Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) – a mechanism by which the Basel III liquidity standard can be met, in a world in which government debt in Australia is relatively scarce compared with other jurisdictions. Let me say a little about this facility. It is not a “bail-out” fund for banks. “Bail-outs” usually mean stumping up public funds to inject capital to an institution whose solvency is in question. The CLF does no such thing. It is a facility, for which the institutions concerned will pay a fee, which would provide cash against quality collateral pledged by institutions that the Bank and APRA judge to be solvent. The fee structure is designed to replicate the cost the institutions would incur if there were sufficient ordinary high quality collateral – i.e. government debt – for them to hold to meet the Basel liquidity requirements – which, of course, there is not. If we are to meet the global standards, we either have to have a facility like this, or have the government issue a few hundred billion dollars in extra gross debt so                                                 1  As part of international monitoring implementation of Basel III, Australia will undergo a so-called Level 2 assessment conducted by the BCBS later this year, which will assess the regulatory consistency of Australia’s implementation of the Basel III minimum requirements. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  the banks can hold it. The relevant ADIs will pay a fee of 15 basis points per annum for the facility whether they use it or not. If they do use it, any funding will be at an interest rate that is 25 basis points above the market rate. This has been developed openly, and under the scrutiny of the international regulatory community. It was approved by the Reserve Bank Board in November 2010. With regard to the “SIFI” reforms, Australia’s large banks cannot realistically be assessed as globally systemic. Hence there was no good reason for them to be classed as G-SIBs. But it cannot be denied that they are domestically systemic, which is why it is appropriate that the Basel Committee’s domestic systemically important bank framework capture them. This will involve some additional minimum loss absorbency on the capital side but also an intensity of supervision that is greater than applied to the “average” ADI – an aspect that is already a key part of APRA’s supervisory approach. In the area of resolution, a number of steps have been taken in recent years, including a strengthening in APRA’s crisis management powers in 2008 and 2010. So far as derivatives markets are concerned, legislation was passed in Australia in December 2012 to help meet emerging international standards. Given uncertainties around both the final shape of key regimes internationally, and the broader market and economic effects of regulation in this area, the final legislative framework contains considerable flexibility. In particular, the legislation does not directly introduce any trade reporting, central clearing or trade execution obligations for OTC derivatives transactions. What it does do is create a mechanism by which such obligations may be implemented by supporting regulations, which would be developed and administered by ASIC. There is more focus generally on what are known as “Financial Market Infrastructures” (FMIs). In April last year, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and IOSCO released new Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, the culmination of two years of detailed standard-setting. The Reserve Bank has revised its own Financial Stability Standards for Central Counterparties and Securities Settlement Facilities, so as to align them with the Principles. It has also committed to assessing Australia’s high-value payment system, RITS, against the Principles on an annual basis. ASIC similarly updated its Regulatory Guide for Clearing and Settlement Facility licensees to reflect the new Principles and aims to ensure consistency with the Principles in the regime it is designing for trade repositories. With regard to shadow banks, the Reserve Bank presents an annual review of shadow banking developments to the Council of Financial Regulators. Our assessment is that the shadow banking system in Australia is relatively small compared with the formal ADI sector, which means that the recommendations being developed internationally are not as important an issue here as they may be for other jurisdictions, at least from a stability perspective. Separately, there is the dimension of investor protection. Here ASIC and APRA are working on strengthening the regulatory framework for retail debenture issuers. ASIC has proposed minimum capital and liquidity requirements, while APRA’s proposals, which are forthcoming, will aim to make clearer that the products offered by these entities are not the same as the deposit products offered by banks. Remaining challenges From this very quick tour of the key regulatory themes, it should be obvious that much has been achieved, but that significant challenges remain. It is, I think, fair to say that as time has passed and implementation has come into focus, various difficulties and complications are coming to the fore. Some aspects of the Basel standards are being tweaked. It has been 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  necessary for standard-setting bodies to issue additional guidance, to provide further clarity regarding new reforms, and to ensure consistency in interpretation and implementation.2 To some extent this was to be expected. Reforms that seemed so simple and obvious, so bold and so sweeping in the immediate aftermath of the crisis of 2008, have turned out to be harder to implement than first expected. This is hardly surprising really, since so much is being attempted at the same time. It is not that attempting much is a mistake: there were serious problems to be addressed and a lot needed to be done. But in so doing, there was always a pretty good chance that the compounding effects of multiple reforms would contain some unexpected and unintended consequences. To take one example, there is concern in some quarters about a potential shortage of high-quality collateral. This arises because regulatory reforms around bank liquidity and centralised clearing are likely to add to demand for high-quality liquid assets. This is spawning great interest by intermediaries to offer collateral transformation services – turning relative risky assets into ostensibly safe ones – that could present new risks. OTC derivatives reforms have been a particularly thorny issue, not least because of the cross-jurisdictional reach of international regulation in this area. European OTC derivatives regulation and US regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act are clear examples of measures that potentially have a strong impact on other jurisdictions. A grouping of market regulators, including ASIC, has been convened to develop some common understandings around the cross-border application of rules. Particularly in a global market such as that for OTC derivatives, consistency with other jurisdictions’ rules is an important consideration in the development of the domestic framework. As OTC derivatives markets make this transition to central clearing, interest is emerging from overseas-based central counterparties in providing their services directly to Australian-based participants. Many international participants in the Australian interest rate swaps market already clear their trades through the UK-based global central counterparty, LCH.Clearnet Limited (LCH). LCH has announced that it will be seeking a licence to provide these services directly to Australian-based participants, alongside a competing offering being developed by the domestic derivatives central counterparty, ASX Clear (Futures). To the extent that participants in smaller markets choose to clear via overseas-based central counterparties it is important that they can do so on appropriate terms, and also that the interests of regulators in these jurisdictions be given due weight. In July last year, ASIC and the Reserve Bank jointly published a document setting out the measures that would be taken to ensure appropriate regulatory influence where an overseas-based central counterparty was operating in Australia. These measures would be applied in the oversight of LCH or any other overseas-based central counterparty that might obtain a licence to provide such services.3 In a world of more central clearing, the question of how the official sector would deal with a situation of FMI distress assumes more importance. As a result of a review by the Council of Financial Regulators in 2011, work is in progress to develop legislative proposals that would                                                 2  An example of this was recent guidance by the BCBS on the usability of high-quality liquid assets under the liquidity coverage ratio. Another is the technical guidance by the FSB to assist national authorities and cross-border crisis management groups in their recovery and resolution planning. 3  In accordance with this approach, the Reserve Bank has already assumed a seat on a new cooperative oversight arrangement for LCH. This will provide a vehicle for representing Australian interests in the design and operation of this important piece of infrastructure. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  give effect to a “step-in” power as part of a comprehensive resolution regime for FMIs. This is to be designed in accordance with international standards.4 These are just a few examples of how the world of regulation and financial oversight is growing more complex. Whether it is the additional demand for high-quality collateral arising from reforms on bank liquidity and centralised clearing, or the extra-territorial reach of US reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act, or the likely difficulties in maintaining systems of reference interest rates in a world where banks are now extremely wary of the legal risks involved in voicing an opinion about where market pricing might be, or the likelihood that some activities will migrate beyond the regulatory net, complications from regulatory activism are in evidence. My guess is that we don’t yet know what all the compounding effects of multiple reforms may be and it may be years before we do. A principle that the Reserve Bank, for its part, has sought to uphold in our own participation in the various reform streams is that we should proceed with all appropriate urgency where needed, but with deliberate care wherever possible, being conscious of the limits to our own knowledge as regulators and the likelihood of unintended consequences from steps we might take. Further ahead The financial reform agenda post 2008 has been very large and comprehensive. There has been a prodigious amount of work across a wide front. It is worth thinking about how this agenda might be managed in the future. It is of course inappropriate to discuss in detail how Australia might approach its responsibilities in the G20 in 2014. The Russian G20 presidency is in full swing and will remain so until at least November. Our job until then is to assist in any way we can for a successful conclusion to that presidency. On financial regulation, the Russian chair has, to date, focused on the G20 working towards completion and implementation of previously announced reforms. This is a multi-year task and one we will inherit. One area the Russian presidency has identified for particular attention is the possible effects of regulatory reforms on the supply of long-term financing, given that one of their major themes is promoting long-term financing for investment. To date the FSB has found little evidence to suggest that global financial regulatory reforms have significantly contributed to current long-term financing concerns, but they have been asked to continue to monitor the possible effects. Australia’s approach will, of course, be a national one, adopted by government, not simply one established by the Reserve Bank. Subject to all those constraints, I would simply observe that, in my opinion, by 2014 we will have reached a point in the financial regulatory sphere where the G20 should be looking for careful and sustained efforts at implementation of the regulatory reforms that have already been broadly agreed, but being wary of adding further reforms to the work program. Absent some major new development, which brings to light some major reform need not hitherto visible, to task the regulatory community and the financial industry with further wholesale changes from here would risk overload. Lest this be considered too weak a position, let us remember how much is being attempted. And since we are already seeing the need to “tweak” some earlier agreed proposals, it is surely clear that the details of implementation should increasingly be our focus over the next few years. The G20 will need to remain open to the possibility – the likelihood even – that as experience is gained with implementation and we grapple with the inevitable difficulties, and as we learn more about how the financial                                                 4  The relevant standards are the FSB’s Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions. Work is also underway by CPSS-IOSCO to establish how best to apply the Key Attributes to financial market infrastructures. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  system is likely to operate in a new world, we will want to make occasional adjustments to the rules. None of that ought to be seen as a retreat from the high level objectives that have guided efforts to date: the desire for a more stable, more resilient and simpler financial system, that is better able and more inclined to play its “handmaiden of industry” role and better able to withstand failures of individual institutions. But in pursuing these goals, it is important that we: • strike the right balance between more regulation and more effective enforcement of existing regulation. Inadequate enforcement and supervision was as big a problem as deficient rules • recognise the cross-border aspects of the financial system, with the associated need for cooperation and, yes, compromise. Recognition of the legitimate interests of smaller markets is clearly of importance to Australia but many other jurisdictions as well. This often coincides with the role of pushing for a principles-based approach instead of a one-size-fits-all heavy-handed, rules-based approach. It may also involve working to develop a “regional voice” on some issues • consider the combination of reforms in their entirety, and keep a lookout for unintended consequences. Given the breadth and speed at which reforms have been introduced in recent years, careful analysis of how the various initiatives will interact is becoming more important. Keeping the regulatory structure fit for purpose across a broad range of jurisdictions around the world is in fact a task that will never be complete, since the financial system evolves – in response to technology and innovation, but also in response to regulation itself. It is important for Australia not only to keep abreast of the developments and implement the key elements of global regulation here, but also to continue to play our own part in helping to develop them, and refining them in light of experience. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Már Guðmundsson: Recent economic and financial developments in Iceland Speech by Mr Már Guðmundsson, Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, at the 52nd Annual General Meeting of the Central Bank of Iceland, Reykjavík 21 March 2013. *      *      * Madame Prime Minister; Ministers; Madame Chairman; Directors and Ambassadors; Ladies and Gentlemen:  As we convene for the 52nd Annual General Meeting of the Central Bank of Iceland, the domestic economic recovery that began in mid-2010 continues, although it has slowed down in recent months. At least to a degree, the slowdown is due to developments internationally. The margin of spare capacity in the economy continues to narrow. Inflation has proven more persistent than previously hoped, however. Early on, wage increases far in excess of productivity growth played a leading role in raising inflation well above the inflation target, but since last autumn the weakening of the króna, triggered by deteriorating terms of trade and a heavy foreign debt service burden, has played a greater part. Monetary policy responded to these developments with interest rate increases beginning in August 2011. The Bank’s interest rates have been unchanged since November, however, and intervention in the foreign exchange market has supported the exchange rate in the recent term, thereby supporting the monetary policy goal of bringing inflation back to target. Global output growth lost pace in 2012, but to differing degrees in various regions. There was a contraction in the euro area and marginal growth in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Among Iceland’s major trading partners, weighted output growth measured 0.8% in 2012, as opposed to 1.7% in 2011. To a degree, the capital controls have shielded the Icelandic financial system from the euro area crisis. The effects felt through external trade were unavoidable, however, and Iceland’s terms of trade deteriorated over the course of the year, while the import purchasing power of export revenues stagnated. This played a part in slowing down output growth, even though Iceland’s growth rate was much faster than in trading partner countries.  According to preliminary figures from Statistics Iceland for 2012 as a whole, output growth measured 1.6% during the year, which is somewhat below the Central Bank’s February forecast of 2.2%. On the other hand, year-2011 growth figures have been revised upwards, from 2.6% to 2.9%. This is well in line with the Central Bank’s first forecast of GDP growth in 2011. It is not uncommon that output growth figures are revised upwards during upward cycles, when more detailed investment figures become available. It will be interesting to see how estimates of 2012 develop.  Output growth in 2012 was driven by growth in private consumption and business investment, while other items, such as net trade and public consumption, made a slightly negative contribution. This is similar to the whole recovery phase in 2010–2012, where business investment and private consumption contributed to output growth more or less equally, with business investment holding a slight advantage. Last year’s growth was sound in the sense that it was not “borrowed” but based on an underlying current account surplus measuring almost 4% of GDP.  In spite of the slowdown in GDP growth last year, the slack in the economy continued to diminish. The economic recovery is continuing, with current forecasts providing for GDP growth of over 2% this year and in the 3½–4% range in 2014 and 2015. Labour market statistics support this forecast of a diminishing slack in the economy. For instance, seasonally adjusted unemployment measured 4½% of the labour force in February, its lowest point since November 2008. A survey carried out regularly by the Central Bank in collaboration with the Confederation of Icelandic Employers shows that, for the first time 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  since March 2008, respondents wishing to recruit staff members outnumber those interested in downsizing.  The slack in the economy still exists, but these developments, together with disappointing inflation figures (which I will mention again later on), give rise to the question of how big that slack is. Every time they take a decision on interest rates, monetary policy decision-makers must ask themselves this question, as previous economic policy mistakes in Iceland and elsewhere – mistakes that have ended in inflation and instability – have often originated in an overestimation of output slack and potential output growth. It is vital to seek out structural reforms that could result in higher growth potential, and important work in that direction is currently underway. But it is equally important not to give rise to unrealistic expectations about how fast potential output can grow. The Central Bank’s analysis and forecasting work always aims to answer this question, which is one of the most important in monetary policy implementation.  Inflation subsided somewhat in 2012, falling from 6½% at the beginning of the year to just over 4% at year-end. The Bank’s February forecast assumed that this trend would continue, provided that the króna did not weaken further. According to the forecast, inflation should be close to target around the middle of next year. Whether that happens earlier or later depends primarily on developments in the exchange rate. It was therefore a disappointment to see how much prices rose in February, raising twelve-month inflation once again. It is always imprudent to read too much into individual measurements, and it has yet to come to light how much of that increase was based on temporary factors. Furthermore, the exchange rate has risen more than 5% since the beginning of the year, which could affect the next measurements. Nonetheless, this inflation measurement gives good reason for caution, and if the role of temporary factors proves smaller than might appear at present and inflation declines to the target more slowly than previously forecast, it will be necessary, other things being equal, to withdraw monetary accommodation sooner than would otherwise be required.  The Central Bank’s interest rates have been unchanged since November 2012, when they were raised by 0.25 percentage points. In its November statement, the Monetary Policy Committee implied that the Bank’s nominal rates could remain unchanged in coming months if developments were in line with the forecast and no additional pay rises were negotiated during the wage settlement review early this year. This has been borne out so far, and the Committee kept rates unchanged at its December, February, and March meetings.  At present, the Central Bank’s effective real interest rate is positive by just under 1%. Although it has risen by nearly 2 percentage points in the past year, it is still below the equilibrium real rate once the economy has recovered and the slack has disappeared. If the economic recovery maintains its pace in coming months, it will therefore be necessary to withdraw the accommodative monetary stance still further. The pace at which this happens depends on economic developments, and the degree to which this normalisation takes place through higher nominal Central Bank rates will depend on future developments in inflation.  Towards the end of last year and in the past several weeks, the Central Bank has sold foreign currency in the interbank market. The Bank also announced that it had temporarily suspended its programme of weekly foreign currency purchases. These measures were approved at an extraordinary meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in early January. The intervention measures amount to 7 b.kr., including 4 b.kr. this year. In comparison, the Bank was a net buyer of foreign currency in the amount of 60 b.kr. in 2010–2012, and those foreign currency purchases were made at a considerably lower exchange rate than the recent sales. Furthermore, on 19 February the Bank concluded a forward currency swap agreement with Landsbankinn in the amount of 6 b.kr., which means that Landsbankinn will not need to accumulate foreign currency to comply with the Bank’s foreign exchange balance requirements. The Monetary Policy Committee is of the opinion that intervention of this type is justifiable in order to mitigate temporary exchange rate volatility that is addressed more effectively with 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  instruments other than interest rates. In recent weeks, the foreign exchange market has been characterised by an unusual combination of features: weakening terms of trade, foreign exchange accumulation in anticipation of heavy foreign debt service, foreign exchange mismatches in the banks’ balance sheets and, in part, self-fulfilling expectations of a currency depreciation. Because these conditions are in part temporary and increased foreign exchange inflows are expected as the spring advances, limited one-off foreign currency sales by the Central Bank were considered appropriate to prevent excessive currency depreciation and stem the tide of these self-fulfilling expectations of market participants. This is consistent with the strategy outlined in the Bank’s report Monetary Policy After Capital Controls, published in late 2010.  Capital controls were imposed early in the winter of 2008 as part of the Government’s IMF programme. In addition to changes to the expiry date of the controls, major amendments have been made twice: in October 2009, when cross-border transfers of krónur were prohibited and outflows deriving from new investment were liberalised; and in March 2012, when exemptions from the Central Bank of Iceland were required for disbursements from the failed banks.  Parliament has just passed amendments to the Foreign Exchange Act, with broad-based support from its members. The Central Bank participated in drafting this amendment and supports it. The amendment creates a stronger foundation for the work that lies ahead in finding a solution to the settlement of the banks’ estates that is consistent with monetary and exchange rate stability and facilitates larger steps in liberalising the controls. The Bank also welcomes the enhanced understanding of the nature of the capital controls and the fact that they are a necessary evil, as is reflected in the consensus on the issue.  The aim of the controls was to arrest the decline of the króna, provide shelter for the restructuring of private sector debt and the financial system as a whole, and create the space for economic policy to mitigate the recession and ultimately support recovery. In broad terms, these goals have been realised. Without the controls, much stricter monetary policy would have been required in the early stages of the crisis. The Treasury would have had much less scope to mitigate the contraction in 2009, as domestic financing of the deficit would have been much more expensive. In this context, it is worth noting that, on average, real interest rates on new domestic Treasury borrowings were negative by almost half a percentage point in 2009–2012.  But these stabilisation gains of the capital controls will diminish over time. The capital controls also have efficiency costs associated with them – costs that were probably modest to start with but increase with time. There is little or no research on how high these costs are at present, and assertions to that effect are not well founded. It is still more difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the risk accompanying liberalisation of the controls, which is presumably greater the faster the controls are lifted and as the economy is less prepared for it. From a theoretical standpoint, we should lift the controls the moment the present value of future efficiency costs exceeds the present value of future stabilisation gains, including the risk accompanying speedy liberalisation. That precise moment can never be identified with any certainty, however, although most signs indicate that it has not come yet, for if it had arrived, rapid liberalisation would be underway. At this point, it is likely that the benefits of lifting the controls more gradually are still greater than the cost of retaining them for a little longer. The pivotal issue here is what tools they give us in order to prevent the settlement of the failed banks from jeopardising financial stability.  But none of this changes the fact that we must lift the controls as soon as it is safe to do so, both because of the economic cost of retaining them and because of Iceland’s international obligations. In my speech a year ago, I said that this was one of the most complex tasks facing the Icelandic authorities at the time. That has not changed. A prerequisite for success is that we base our efforts on the best possible analysis of the problem and the potential solutions to it. Until now, the controls have been viewed as providing shelter during the 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  resolution of the balance of payments problems caused by the collapse of the financial system. If all non-residents’ potentially volatile claims on residents were paid in a short period of time, Iceland would pay down foreign debt much more rapidly than is desirable. If worse comes to worst, the deleveraging could amount to roughly half Iceland’s GDP in relatively few years. Under such circumstances, the króna would depreciate significantly, at least over a considerable period of time, the banks’ liquidity would be weakened, and public sector finances would do likewise. Domestic and foreign Treasury financing would be much more difficult and expensive to come by.  But is this analysis correct? Is Iceland faced with a balance of payments and refinancing problem rather than a debt sustainability problem? The difference between the two lies in the fact that a household, firm, national treasury, or nation is facing a debt sustainability problem if cannot service its debt with the available revenue surplus no matter how long the debt is stretched out. Then debt relative to income rises without limits. In that case, there are only three solutions: increased revenue surpluses, reduction of debt, or reduction of interest rates. On the other hand, a payment and refinancing problem exists when a longer loan duration would eliminate temporary debt service shortfalls. But two provisos must be made here. First of all, the boundaries between the two are not always clear. Unlimited loan durations are not available. A sustained refinancing problem can lead to a default and a debt sustainability problem. It can also change into a debt sustainability problem if interest rates rise steeply upon refinancing. Second of all, a nation’s debt is different in nature than the debt of an individual. A nation consists of numerous legal entities, and if some of them cannot handle their debt, it need not have severe consequences for other parts of the whole, provided that the sovereign is not involved. Under a flexible exchange rate regime, national debt service in excess of surpluses will also cause the currency to depreciate and the surplus to grow. But this process is not without limits.  Earlier this week, the Central Bank published a report on Iceland’s underlying external position, in which it addresses the question of whether Iceland is facing a debt sustainability problem or a balance of payments problem as I have just defined them. But in order to answer that question, it is necessary to peer through the settlement of the estates resulting from the financial crisis – a process that is nowhere near completion – and correct for the effects of certain international corporations operating in this country. These companies have a profound effect on Iceland’s international investment position as measured according to international standards, but they would have a negligible impact on the state of the domestic economy if they defaulted on their debt. As a result, the task requires a great deal of estimation and entails some uncertainty, as previous findings have shown. The estimates are now more reliable than before, however, as time has clarified a number of factors concerning the failed banks’ estates and analysts have now gained access to the best available data.  The results are the same as in previous appraisals, however, in that there are no signs of a debt sustainability problem as I have just defined it. Iceland’s net underlying debt position is estimated at 60% of GDP, the lowest since 1999. Furthermore, it is lower than that of many countries that no one would claim faced a sustainability problem. New Zealand’s net debt position, for instance, has hovered around 80% for more than one decade. Based on the outlook for Iceland’s underlying trade balance and the prospects for domestic output growth, this would be sufficient to reduce its debt position by 18 percentage points of GDP through 2017. Considering the uncertainties in the estimate, it is likely that the net external debt position lay in the range of 35–80% of GDP at year-end 2012. But the upper end of this range is not enough to create a debt sustainability problem as, even in this case, Iceland’s debt will still continue to decline through this period. In addition, it should be noted that this estimate assumes that the current stock of offshore krónur is assessed at the onshore exchange rate and the failed banks’ ISK assets are assessed at nearly full book values and at the onshore exchange rate. That will not be the case, of course. In order to gain some perspective on the amounts involved, it is useful to note that each 25% reduction in the valuation following the sale of these assets from the estates and their expatriation from 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Iceland reduces the measured debt position by a full six percentage points of GDP. The final figure will be much large than this, of course.  Is there no problem, then? Yes, there is. The report shows that the balance of payments problem could become substantial in a very few years if domestic access to foreign capital and refinancing does not improve. It is estimated that there will be a surplus on the underlying current account balance this year – just under 4% of GDP – but this excludes the estates of the failed banks and the effects of pharmaceuticals company Actavis. Iceland could therefore reduce its net external debt by that amount. The problem is, however, that the calculations shown in the Bank’s report assume this surplus could contract in coming years and may even turn into a deficit at a time of rising foreign debt service for borrowers without access to foreign refinancing. If these parties do not gain access to the market on acceptable terms in the near future, or if other capital inflows are not forthcoming, significant downward pressure on the Icelandic króna will be inevitable. Weighing heavily in this context is the debt owed by new Landsbankinn to the old bank. Negotiations concerning the possible lengthening of the maturity of this debt are underway.  It is possible to argue that this outlook is based on extremely pessimistic assumptions. Market access has already opened up, as Arion Bank’s recent foreign borrowings show. The calculations in the Bank’s report assume that foreign interest rates will return to pre-crisis levels in a few years, but there are few signs of this at present. It is also assumed that the import ratio will return to pre-crisis levels. The Central Bank will examine additional scenarios for possible developments in the balance of payments in coming years, and developments in market access in coming months will have a significant effect on the outlook.  In spite of this proviso and the necessity of not presenting unrealistically pessimistic scenarios that could undermine confidence needlessly, this scenario does not go so far, and we must determine what we can do to prevent such an outcome. Economic policy and the structural reforms must ensure that Iceland’s competitive position does not deteriorate more than can be expected following a normal rise in the real exchange rate from historically low levels, given that we will have a current account surplus while we are working our way through the bulk of the debt. It is most important that public sector finances be well in surplus during this period and that attempts be made to ensure a higher level of national saving than prevailed in Iceland before the crisis. Furthermore, it is clear that the scope to use the current account surplus to release non-residents’ ISK assets will be extremely limited in coming years.  How likely is it, then, that we can lift the capital controls in the next few years? Obviously, it would be much easier if new capital inflows were forthcoming, either through new foreign borrowing or through foreign direct investment. In addition, it is clear that no decisive steps can be taken to lift the controls before a suitable solution is found to the settlement of the failed banks’ estates. That solution could take many forms, and these would affect the subsequent approach to lifting the controls. A revised liberalisation strategy would therefore look quite different depending on what route is chosen for the settlement of the failed banks’ estates. A solution to this problem must therefore come first.  I won’t discuss these possibilities at greater length here, as a great deal of work lies ahead, and it would be unwise to show our hand at this point. Furthermore, it is necessary to have more than one option at hand, in case the one that seems best at the outset proves infeasible later on. It is possible, however, to make a few comments that will enhance the general understanding of what needs to happen. If a portion of the estates are settled through composition agreements, it is of key importance that the ISK asset recoveries add as little as possible (or nothing at all) to the stock of volatile ISK assets owned by non-residents. It is important to bear in mind that selling the banks at a relatively low price to foreign investors interested more in the short term and in handsome dividend payments does not solve the problem and could even exacerbate it.  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It is the role of the estates to divest the assets and make payments to creditors. The question is, however, what is a realistic price for the assets, and at what exchange rate will they be converted into foreign currency. That depends on who wants to buy them and is willing and able to bring in the necessary currency, which cannot come from export revenues or the Bank’s foreign exchange reserves.  In lifting the capital controls, we are faced with the question of how far we are willing to go. Shall we return to the way things were before the crash? History shows that Iceland has generally done best when it has maintained open business ties with the rest of the world. Iceland is not alone in this regard, of course, as both history and economic theory have shown that international trade generally enhances well-being. This is also true of capital transactions. But it is also a fact that most severe financial crises in small, open economies like Iceland originate, at least in part, in excessively volatile capital flows to and from the country, which foster debt accumulation and asset bubbles during upswings and then shut down the mains during the downward cycle. Unrestricted capital flows are thus coupled not only with benefits but also with risk. This risk can be mitigated with sound economic policy and an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework, but it will never disappear entirely. Consequently, there are a number of signs that, contrary to generally accepted ideas about free trade in goods and services, financial integration with the outside world can actually go too far. This is supported by studies indicating that there are “thresholds” in terms of benefits from financial integration and that form matters. For instance, foreign direct investment does not usually jeopardise economic stability, while short-term movements and carry trade are riskier.  It can be argued that Iceland had gone too far in financial integration in the years before the financial crisis. In part because of this, the Central Bank recommended, in its 2012 report entitled Prudential Rules Following Capital Controls, that before the capital controls are lifted, restrictions should be placed on financial firms’ foreign exchange risk and their ability to expand their foreign currency balance sheets with the associated maturity mismatches. Restrictions would also be placed on foreign-denominated borrowing by households, firms, and municipalities without income in the borrowed currencies. These ideas are being developed and honed, and some of them could be implemented with the entry into force of new liquidity and foreign exchange balance rules that the Central Bank intends to issue this year.  It has been said that a reassessment of the monetary policy framework must take place before the capital controls can be lifted in full. This is perhaps not as critical as it might seem, however, as countries with unrestricted capital flows have various kinds of monetary policy framework. Nonetheless, it is necessary to review our monetary policy, and the Bank has published reports on this topic in the recent term, one entitled Monetary Policy After Capital Controls and the other entitled Iceland’s Currency and Exchange Rate Policy Options. In addition, there could be a number of policy formulation tasks ahead for the Central Bank which are beyond the scope of my speech today, such as financial system structure – including questions on the extent to which further restrictions should be placed on maturity mismatches in financial institutions’ balance sheets and how the system’s public goods elements can be protected against leveraged speculation.  Honoured guests: In closing, I would like to thank the Central Bank’s many collaborators for a successful co-operative relationship over the past year. First among them are the ministries with which the Bank works most closely – in particular, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, which now is responsible within the ministries for the affairs of the Central Bank. In this context, I wish to thank the two Ministers who have led the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs since this arrangement was introduced. I would also like to thank the Parliament of Iceland, particularly the Economics and Commerce Committee, for their cooperation during the year. Thanks are due as well to the Financial Supervisory Authority for growing collaborative relationship. I thank the outgoing Supervisory Council for good cooperation. And last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank the staff of the Central Bank for their hard work and excellent contribution during the year.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yves Mersch: Opening of the “New Face of the Euro” exhibition Opening remarks by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the opening of the “New Face of the Euro” exhibition, Bank of Spain, Madrid, 25 March 2013. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,  On behalf of the European Central Bank, I would like to warmly welcome you to today’s event and thank you for having accepted our invitation. In particular, I would like to thank Mr Restoy for his kind words. I am very pleased that you have offered to host the “New Face of the Euro” exhibition in the Sala Chaflán of the Banco de España. The exhibition focuses on the new series of euro banknotes. They will start to appear in May this year. Then the new €5 banknote enters into circulation. The hologram and watermark of this note show a portrait of a woman from the classical world. But it’s not Cybele, who you can see just outside this building. I realise the madrileños among you could be disappointed. It’s Europa, a figure from Greek mythology. And that’s why the new series is called the Europa series.  But the exhibition covers more than that. It’s a chance to learn about the money we have all been using for more than a decade now. A whole generation is growing up that has known no other currency. So younger visitors to the exhibition might be curious to see the peseta and the other currencies on display here that perhaps their parents have told them about. And they will surely enjoy the kids’ corner, which offers a more playful way to learn about the euro. The banknote denominations – from €5 to €500 – show examples of buildings and bridges in different architectural styles down the ages. They aim to highlight the common cultural heritage of Europe. And the new notes with the new element seek to strengthen that sense of belonging and commitment to Europe. One of the main tasks of the central banks in the euro area is to ensure the integrity of euro banknotes. This means we have to steadily develop the notes to stay ahead of counterfeiters. So the Europa series has some new and enhanced security features. They will be even more difficult to counterfeit.  Over a period of several years, the Europa series will gradually replace the first series of euro banknotes. These new notes will be just as easy to recognise and to check.  Our single currency is a key step within the on-going process of European integration. The euro banknotes have become the most visible symbol of that process. The euro has become moreover a symbol of solidarity in times of crisis, with the euro area assisting countries that have to go through tough but necessary adjustments. With the support of their European partners the Spanish authorities have been decisive in embarking on a financial adjustment programme that has helped to clean the balance sheets of the weakest banks and recapitalised them with fresh funds. This has laid the foundations for a revival of the flow of credit to the real economy. Allow me a personal remark, that I have the greatest respect for the Spanish people who are experiencing hard times but are sticking to their commitments and responsibilities.  Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope that you will enjoy visiting the New Face of the Euro Exhibition. Without further ado, it is a pleasure for me to declare the exhibition open.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sarah Bloom Raskin: Focusing on low and moderate-income working Americans Speech by Ms Sarah Bloom Raskin, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition Annual Conference, Washington, DC, 22 March 2013. *      *      * I am delighted to be here at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) Annual Conference today, and to be gathered with so many people who have been working for decades to strengthen communities and the integrity of our nation’s economic institutions and financial practices. Those of you involved in community development and community reinvestment know all too well the trauma and hardship experienced by low-income communities over the last several years. You know it in a way that is lost on people whose communities have not been so badly battered by these economic storms. That’s why I’m looking forward this morning to sharing with you my perspective on the importance of focusing on the situation and prospects of low- and moderate-income working Americans. In my remarks, I will start by discussing the types of jobs being generated in the current recovery. Certainly, the pace of recovery in employment has improved, but it’s important to look at the types of jobs that are being created because those jobs will directly affect the fortunes and challenges of households and neighborhoods as well as the course of the recovery. I will then suggest that we think about how the absence of a substantial number of new high-paying jobs, when combined with changes in the landscape for financial services, affects access generally to affordable, sustainable credit. Finally, I will explore some of the monetary, supervisory, and regulatory touchpoints in which the situation and prospects of low- and moderate-income working Americans can be addressed. Challenges posed by labor market conditions The Great Recession stands out for the magnitude of job losses we experienced throughout the downturn. These factors have hit low- and moderate-income Americans the hardest. The poverty rate has risen sharply since the onset of the recession, after a decade of relative stability, and it now stands at 15 percent – significantly higher than the average over the past three decades.1 And those who are fortunate enough to have held onto their jobs have seen their hourly compensation barely keep pace with the cost of living over the past three years.2  While today’s 7.7 percent unemployment rate is a marked improvement from the 10 percent rate we reached in late 2009, it is still higher than the unemployment rate for the 24 years before the Great Recession, a span of time over which the rate averaged about 6 percent. Moreover, the government’s current estimate of 12 million unemployed does not include nearly a million discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work and 8 million people who say that they are working part time even though they would prefer a full-time job. A broader measure of underemployment that includes these and other potential workers stands at 14.3 percent. About two-thirds of all job losses resulting from the recession were in moderate-wage occupations, such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration jobs.                                                 1 Mean annual poverty rate for all people. U.S. Bureau of the Census. 2 These dynamics have disproportionately hurt the young, the less-educated, and racial and ethnic minorities. The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma is 11.2 percent. Among workers age 16 to 19, the unemployment rate is 25.1 percent. Compared with the 7.7 percent unemployment rate for all workers, the unemployment rate among African Americans is 13.8 percent, and 9.6 percent among Latinos. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  However, these occupations have accounted for less than one-quarter of subsequent job gains. The declines in lower-wage occupations – such as retail sales and food service – accounted for about one-fifth of job loss, but a bit more than one-half of subsequent job gains. Indeed, recent job gains have been largely concentrated in lower-wage occupations such as retail sales, food preparation, manual labor, home health care, and customer service.3  Furthermore, wage growth has remained more muted than is typical during an economic recovery. To some extent, the rebound is being driven by the low-paying nature of the jobs that have been created. The slow rebound also reflects the severe nature of the crisis, as the slow wage growth especially affects those workers who have become recently re-employed following long spells of unemployment. In fact, while average wages have continued to increase steadily for persons who have remained employed all along, the average wage for new hires have actually declined since 2010.4  The faces of low-wage Americans are diverse. They include people of varying employment status, race, gender, immigration status, and other characteristics. Many such Americans are attached to the workforce and are deeply committed to both personal success and to making a contribution to society. For purposes of reference, in 2011, low wage was defined as $23,005 per year or $11.06 per hour.5  Today, about one-quarter of all workers are considered “low wage.” They are sanitation workers, office receptionists, and nursing assistants; they are single mothers of three who worry: How will I be able to send my children to college? What if my landlord raises the rent this year? Tens of millions of Americans are the people who ask themselves these questions every day. This diverse group of workers faces numerous barriers when trying to access the labor market or advance in their current positions. Many of these barriers were identified in an initiative that the Federal Reserve’s Community Development function launched in 2011. Over the course of a year, Reserve Banks across the country hosted a series of 32 regional discussions aimed at examining the complex factors creating chronic unemployment conditions and identifying promising workforce development solutions.6 The kinds of problems faced by low-wage workers are familiar to all of you and have long been part of the structural conditions of poverty and near-poverty in America. We know, for example, that location presents thorny challenges for many low-wage workers. Within metropolitan areas, jobs are not spread out evenly and job creation tends to be depressed in low-income communities. As a result, many low-wage workers face long commutes and serious commuting difficulties due to less reliable transportation and an inadequate transportation infrastructure. Moreover, a number of low-wage employees work non-standard hours, exacerbating both transportation and childcare issues, as well as personal health problems.7                                                  3 See National Employment Law Project (2012), “The Low-Wage Recovery and Growing Inequality (PDF),” Data Brief, August. These patterns were also observed during the recessions of the early 1990s and early 2000’s – the so-called “jobless recoveries”– but not prior to then. 4 On average, a person’s income remains depressed for decades following job loss, and income losses over one’s working life are especially severe when the job loss occurs during a recession. See Steven J. Davis and Till von Wachter (2011), “Recession and the Costs of Job Loss (PDF),” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, September 12. 5 See Rebecca Thiess (2012). “The Future of Work: Trends and Challenges for Low-Wage Workers (PDF),” EPI Briefing Paper, April 27. 6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “A Perspective from Main Street: Long-Term Unemployment and Workforce Development (PDF),” December. 7 Ibid. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Traditionally, many workers find jobs through social networks and through personal connections that they have to the labor market. But, because low-income individuals are typically less mobile, more isolated, and less socially connected than other people, they are often left out of the social networks that, in practice, lead to jobs for most Americans. Addressing these challenges Among those responding to these challenges are innovative local practitioners who are implementing programs designed to expand job opportunities for low-wage workers. Consider Impact Services in Philadelphia, an organization that builds relationships with the local business community to better understand their hiring needs and then devises programs that supply those firms with appropriately skilled workers from the community.8 The National Fund for Workforce Solutions is another example. This organization works with local communities to organize funding collaboratives to support regional industries.9  More recent challenges for low-wage workers So progress is being made, thanks to coalitions like these across the country that are working for practical changes at the community level. But the 21st century labor market is increasingly complex; it continues to generate new challenges. For example, growth in sectors such as green industries and advanced manufacturing is creating jobs, but these jobs may demand different skills. Access to reliable information becomes critical for workers who are considering a new job, and must carefully weigh the skills and credentials required by potential employers with the cost of training and the likelihood of gaining employment. And, more and more, employers are requiring post-secondary credentials. Today, a high school diploma alone is less likely to qualify an individual for a job with a path toward meaningful advancement. And, as demand for more credentials increases, workers who lack those credentials will find it increasingly difficult to gain upward mobility in the job market. Contingent work Many employers are looking to make the employment relationship more flexible, and so are increasingly relying on part-time work and a variety of arrangements popularly known as “contingent work.” This trend toward a more flexible workforce will likely continue. For example, while temporary work accounted for 10 percent of job losses during the recession, these jobs have accounted for more than 25 percent of net employment gains since the recession ended.10 In fact, temporary help is rapidly approaching a new record, and businesses’ use of staffing services continues to increase.11                                                 8 For more information about Impact Services Corporation, go to www.impactservices.org/employment-and-training. 9 One of the National Fund's collaboratives is the Southwest Alabama Workforce Development Council (SAWDC). This collaborative is working to address a local skills gap by creating a comprehensive workforce development system for the region. This system includes formal feedback from the business community to the educational system about skills that are in high demand. Educators then develop a curriculum that prepares students to access the local job market. During the National Fund's first five years of existence, it worked with more than 3,000 employers to serve more than 42,000 job seekers and workers across 32 communities.

4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Contingent employment is arguably a sensible response to today’s competitive marketplace. Contingent arrangements allow firms to maximize workforce flexibility in the face of seasonal and cyclical forces. The flexibility may be beneficial for workers who want or need time to address their family needs. However, workers in these jobs often receive less pay and fewer benefits than traditional full-time or “permanent” workers, are much less likely to benefit from the protections of labor and employment laws, and often have no real pathway to upward mobility in the workplace.12  Many workers who hold contingent positions do so involuntarily. Department of Labor statistics tell us that 8 million Americans say they are working part-time jobs but would like full-time jobs.13 These are the people in our communities who are “part time by necessity.” As businesses increase their reliance on independent contractors and part-time, temporary, and seasonal positions, workers today bear far more of the responsibility and risk for managing their careers and financial security. Indeed, the expansion of contingent work has contributed to the increasing gap between high- and low-wage workers and to the increasing sense of insecurity among workers.14 Flexible and part-time arrangements can present great opportunities to some workers, but the substantial increase in part-time workers does raise a number of concerns. Part-time workers are particularly vulnerable to personal shocks due to lower levels of compensation, the absence of meaningful benefits, and even a lack of paid sick or personal days. Not surprisingly, turnover is high in these part-time jobs. Access to credit The economic marginalization that comes with the growth of part-time and low-paying jobs is exacerbated by inadequate access to credit for many working Americans. Ideally, people chronically short of cash would have access to safe and sound financial institutions that could provide reliable and affordable access to credit as well as good savings plans. Unfortunately, many working Americans have no practical access to reasonably priced financial products with safe features, much less the kind of safe and fair credit that is available to wealthier consumers. Working Americans have several core financial needs. They need a safe, accessible, and affordable method to deposit or cash checks, receive deposits, pay bills, and accrue savings. They may also need access to credit to tide them over until their next cash infusion arrives. They may be coming up short on paying their rent, their mortgage, an emergency medical expense, or an unexpected car repair. They may want access to a savings vehicle that, down the road, will help them pay for these items and for education or further training, or start a business. And many want some form of non-cash payment method to conduct transactions that are difficult or impossible to conduct using cash. Products and services that serve these core financial needs are not consistently available at competitive rates to working Americans. Those with low and moderate incomes may have insufficient income or assets to meet the relatively high requirements needed to establish a credit history. Others may have problems in their credit history that inhibit their ability to borrow on competitive terms.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Many workers simply may not have banks in their communities, or may not have access to banks that actually compete with each other in terms of pricing or customer service. There is a growing trend toward greater concentration of financial assets at fewer banks. In my mind, this raises doubts about whether banking services will continue to be provided at competitive rates to all income levels of customers wherever they may live. According to a study of bank branch locations published by NCRC in 2007, there are more persons per branch in low- and moderate-income census tracts than in moderate- and upper-income census tracts. While branch-building has been on the rise, indications are that the increase in the number of bank offices has not occurred evenly across neighborhoods of varying income.15  In fact, a significant number of low- and moderate-income families have become – or are at risk of becoming– financially marginalized. The percentage of families earning $15,000 per year or less who reported that they have no bank account increased between 2007 and 2009 such that more than one in four families was unbanked. Families slightly further up the income distribution, earning between $25,000 and $30,000 per year, are also financially marginalized: 13 percent report being unbanked and almost 24 percent report being underbanked.16  This combination of economic insecurity and financial marginalization has incentivized more low- and moderate-income families to seek out alternative financial service providers to meet their financial needs. Some of the providers they find, such as check-cashers and outfits furnishing advance loans on paychecks, can lead unwary workers into very deep financial holes. In light of these challenges, I ask questions that have been asked before: What can economic policy do to reduce unemployment, economic marginalization, and the financial vulnerability of millions of lower-income working Americans? There is no simple cure to these conditions, but government policymakers need to focus seriously on the problems, not simply because of notions of fairness and justice, but because the economy’s ability to produce a stable quality of living for millions of people is at stake. Our country cannot achieve prosperity without addressing the powerful undertow created by flat wages and tenuous financial security for so many millions of Americans. The role of monetary policy So how can the Federal Reserve address these challenges? Let me start with monetary policy. Congress has directed the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to promote maximum employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve’s primary monetary policy tool is its ability to influence the level of interest rates. Federal Reserve policymakers pushed short-term interest rates down nearly to zero as the financial crisis spread and the recession worsened in 2007 and 2008. By late 2008, it was clear that still more policy stimulus was necessary to turn the recession around. The Federal Reserve could not push short-term interest rates down further, but it could – and did – use the unconventional policy tools to bring longer-term interest rates such as mortgage rates down further. Fed policymakers intend to keep interest rates low for a considerable time to promote a stronger economic recovery, a substantial improvement in labor market conditions, and                                                 15 See National Community Reinvestment Coalition (2007), “Are Banks on the Map? An Analysis of Bank Branch Location in Working Class and Minority Neighborhoods (PDF),” March. 16 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2012), “2011 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households,” September; and Brian K. Bucks, Arthur B. Kennickell, Traci L. Mach, and Kevin B. Moore (2009), “Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances (PDF),” Federal Reserve Bulletin, v. 95 (February), pp. A1–A55. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  greater progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability. Both anecdotal evidence and a wide range of economic indicators show that these attempts are working to strengthen the recovery and that the labor market is improving. Nonetheless, and again, the millions of people who would prefer to work full time can find only part-time work. While the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tools can be effective in promoting stronger economic recovery and job gains, they have little effect on the types of jobs that are created, particularly over the longer term. So, while monetary policy can help, it does not address all of the challenges that low- and moderate-income workers are confronting. That said, the existing mandate regarding maximum employment requires policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to understand labor market dynamics, which obviously must include an understanding of low- and moderate-income workers. Regulatory and supervisory touchpoints In addition to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve’s regulatory and supervisory policies have the potential to address some of the challenges faced by low-income communities and consumers. The Federal Reserve is required by law – by virtue of the Bank Holding Company Act – to approve various applications, such as mergers, acquisitions, and proposals to conduct new activities. This statutory review requires an explicit consideration of public benefits and the effects of the proposed transaction on the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. This assessment is, as many of you know, a critical opportunity for community input and analysis. Indeed, as people with their feet firmly planted on the ground in communities across America, you probably remember James Q. Wilson’s theory of “broken windows” in community policing: Move in quickly when vandalism and disorder first start to appear – even if it is only a broken window or graffiti on a stop sign – or else face losing the whole neighborhood as disrespect for the law rapidly spreads.17  The “broken windows” strategy is every bit as compelling when it comes to addressing the disorder that comes from sloppy practices by financial institutions. If banking practices are undermining the ability of the economically marginalized to become financially included and to access the credit they need in an affordable way, regulators must move in quickly to stop the disorder and repair the broken windows of financial intermediation. Bank supervisors should be prepared to respond to the earliest signs of trouble by requiring operationally challenged banks to address problems quickly and completely. If corrections are made, then the regulators can move on. If not, then the regulators need to escalate enforcement. Swift and decisive corrective action is not always how federal bank regulators have responded to broken windows in the past. In my view, for example, regulators’ response to the rampant, long-running problems in loan-servicing practices at large financial institutions was not swift and was not decisive. The point is that federal regulators must listen carefully to community input and analysis in order to keep track of where windows are breaking and how they are being broken. And they must carefully study and take responsibility for analyzing comments provided by organizations such as the NCRC when considering the public benefit of an application. Both the exam process and the application process must be strengthened as key venues for federal regulators to incorporate the voices of affected communities; I’d like to see us revise and strengthen these processes to include the analysis in these voices.                                                 17 See George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson (1982), “Broken Windows: The police and neighborhood safety”, The Atlantic, March 1, http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  The role of business Now let’s shift back to the private sector. In particular, to the question of whether businesses can be competitive in the current marketplace and still provide a pathway out of poverty for their employees. The Hitachi Foundation recently set out to answer this question by identifying firms that provided upward job mobility for their employees. They found that the identified employers showed noteworthy consistency in how they train and educate workers, develop career ladders, and craft supportive human resources policies and other motivators. They also found some evidence to indicate that the companies benefited from strategic and financial returns while their lower-wage workers also benefited from increased earnings and career advancement.18, 19 “Anchor institutions,” such as hospitals and universities, which are firmly rooted in their locales, can also be powerful engines for job creation in their communities. Anchors may include cultural institutions, health care facilities, community foundations, faith-based institutions, public utilities, and municipal governments. These institutions have the potential to generate local jobs through targeted procurement purchases of food, energy, supplies, and services from local businesses. This can be a substantial, positive development in the local economy.20  The Evergreen Cooperative in Cleveland, Ohio, is an example of a network of worker-owned businesses, launched in low-income neighborhoods, to support local anchor institutions. The cooperatives were initially established to provide services to local hospitals and universities that had agreed to make their purchases locally. This model is effective because it capitalizes on local production, and because it forges a local business development strategy that effectively meets many of the anchor institutions’ own needs.21  Role for community-based organizations Clearly, the challenges facing low-wage workers are multi-faceted and complex. In addition to the challenges that workforce development and community organizations have addressed for years, structural changes in the economy heighten obstacles, make the stakes higher if we fail to conquer them, and, therefore, require new levels of openness and creativity by                                                 18 For more information about The Hitachi Foundation, go to www.hitachifoundation.org/index.php. 19 While the common perception may be that businesses do not invest in employee training, a survey by the American Society for Training and Development indicated that employers committed $172 billion in 2011 to employee training. See American Society for Training and Development (2011), “2011 State of the Industry Report Shows Increased Spending, Commitment for L&D,” December 20. This investment, however, traditionally funds the highest-educated and highest-paid employees. The Hitachi Foundation has suggested that considering a reallocation of even a small portion of these funds toward frontline workers would offer benefits to both employers and employees. As an example of these employer practices, right here in our backyard, the Community Foundation for the National Capital Region piloted the “Career Navigators” program with three hospitals in Maryland’s Montgomery County and one in the District of Columbia to help employees navigate a pathway to better jobs with their current employer. These hospitals concluded that investing in training and education for top-performing, entry-level staffers in positions such as housekeeping, food service, and patient transport could provide a pipeline for the skilled employees that the hospitals would rely upon in the future. Employees receive support with literacy and college-readiness training, career coaching, and scholarships. The program also helps hospitals document internal career pathways and train the human resource staff to serve as career coaches. Throughout these efforts, the participating hospitals have reported enhanced employee engagement, reduced errors, and improved performance. 20 See Ted Howard (2012), “Owning Your Own Job Is Beautiful Thing: Community Wealth Building in Cleveland, Ohio (PDF),” in Nancy O. Andrews and David J. Erickson, eds., Investing in What Works for America’s Communities (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Low Income Investment Fund).

8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  policymakers. You are the ideal audience for this message because you know how to link federal policymaking with economic empowerment. NCRC has grown to an association of more than 600 community-based organizations that promote access to basic banking services to create and sustain affordable housing, jobs, and vibrant communities for America’s working families. Community-based organizations like many of those represented in this room will need to consider how to work with low-wage workers to bridge information gaps by expanding workers’ networks, providing legitimate information, and identifying new job opportunities. But finally, the pressure that community-based organizations exert on financial regulators must continue. Access to credit is an enduring challenge, and the obstacles and problems – all the “broken windows” you see on the block – must be reported and explained. They must be understood by the federal policymakers who are responsible for enforcing our country’s laws and regulations in the realm of access to credit; by the federal policymakers who engage in the conduct of monetary policy; and by the federal policymakers whose actions contribute to the shaping of the landscape for financial services in this country. Your voices – whether you are reporting, documenting, monitoring, analyzing, proposing, or even protesting – must be heard. Your voices are crucial to alerting policymakers to the significant developments and emerging trends in the nation’s communities that must be confronted – and confronted in a swift and decisive way – if we are to make prosperity a national agenda that touches every American. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jwala Rambarran: The proposed new regulatory regime for credit unions Feature address by Mr Jwala Rambarran, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at the Sixty Third Annual General Meeting of the Telephone Workers’ Credit Union Co-operative Society Limited, Port of Spain, 16 March 2013. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I sincerely thank the Board of Telephone Workers’ Credit Union for the kind invitation to deliver the feature address at your Sixty Third Annual General Meeting. It is indeed an honour for me to be part of this occasion. In June 1950, Telephone Workers’ Credit Union opened its doors with 38 members and a share capital of $51. Sixty three years later, you can boast a membership in excess of 5,000 and a resource base of nearly $415 million. This enduring journey of building wealth for generations of your members is certainly testimony to the significant resilience of Telephone Workers’ Credit Union and a clear indication that you are living up to your motto “Progress through Self Reliance”. In fact, I am aware of a few other credit unions whose journeys are broadly similar to Telephone Workers’ Credit Union and which can boast of their own achievements. For this reason, I want to underscore that the Central Bank recognizes the important contribution that credit unions are making to our society, especially in reaching out to the ordinary working men and women who are underserved by traditional financial institutions. Indeed, I find it a fitting tribute to the global credit union movement, which has always stressed the brotherhood of man that, the new Pope who is known for his concerns for the poor, chose for the first time the name of Saint Francis of Assisi, whose prayer is widely recognized as the official prayer of credit unions worldwide. For more than 65 years, the credit union movement in Trinidad and Tobago has been putting this ideal of the brotherhood of man into practice in the socio-economic field. Credit unions have been helping their members to develop a savings habit, to educate them on financial matters, and to finance small business start ups, even while experiencing considerable turbulence and consolidation. Today, about one-third of the population are members of credit unions and collectively manage some $9.5 billion in assets, or almost 4 percent of the total assets of the entire financial system. In effect, Ladies and Gentlemen, the credit union movement has contributed to financial deepening in the Trinidad and Tobago economy, bringing financial services closer to their members, their families and their communities. And this, in turn, has encouraged greater financial inclusion for which I commend the local credit union movement. Nonetheless, the growth and development of the credit union sector has taken place within a legislative framework that does not provide for formal prudential regulation and supervision. As you know, the present legislation governing the credit union movement – the Co-operative Societies Act – dates back to 1971 and falls short of a prudential framework to protect members’ savings and to help safeguard the integrity of the domestic financial system. I am reminded of the insightful words of Independent Senator Subas Ramkhelawan during his contribution last December to the debate on the Securities Industry Bill. Senator Ramkhelawan indicated that “financial regulation on the whole is like the building of a fortress, and it is important in the building of a fortress that all the walls must be equally fortified, because the marauders at the gate will always look for the weakest point to infiltrate”. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  We have indeed seen the marauders at the gate, breaching the fortress of regulation, both in the insurance and credit union sectors. And we are still experiencing the painful emotional and financial costs to our citizens and to our economy. Accordingly, I would like to take the opportunity this morning to speak about issues related to the new proposed regulatory regime for credit unions, which is expected to come into effect sometime in the second half of 2013. • First, I will explain why the Central Bank should be the prudential regulator for credit unions in Trinidad and Tobago; • Second, I wish to highlight the key principles underlying the proposed credit union regulatory regime, and the fundamental differences between the Co-operative Societies Acts and the Draft Credit Union Bill; and • Finally, I will address some lingering concerns of the national credit union movement. Prudential regulation of the credit union sector by the central bank Ladies and Gentlemen, many of you would recall that the Cabinet decision in July 2005 to bring credit unions under the regulatory authority of the Central Bank was initially met with disquiet by the credit union movement. This uneasiness, perhaps rightly so at that time, stemmed from the fear that the Central Bank did not really understand the unique character of credit unions and would unfairly treat them just like banks. The fact that the original proposal to bring credit unions under the regulatory authority of the Central Bank envisaged a division of the movement by asset size did little to ease these fears. I am very pleased to see that we have come a long way over the past decade. The Central Bank is certainly more appreciative and understanding of the special nature of credit unions which value democracy, volunteerism, member equality and participation, member education and training, and community development. As far as I can judge, today the credit union movement as a whole is strongly supportive of the need for specific legislation that recognizes these special characteristics of credit unions, and supports the rationale behind the Central Bank as prudential regulator of the entire credit union sector. Of course, some are still of the view that increasing the resources and improving the skillsets of the Office of the Commissioner for Co-operatives as well as effecting amendments to the existing Cooperative Societies Act will suffice in regulating the credit union sector. The fact, however, is that this “light regulatory touch” is usually less effective for those credit unions and their members that need it most. I can assure you that, based on the data available to the Central Bank, several credit unions will have to improve their operations to be in accordance with sound prudential principles espoused by the legislation. Perhaps the most compelling reason why the Central Bank should be the regulator for credit unions in Trinidad and Tobago is that credit unions are deposit-taking entities. This places a fiduciary responsibility on directors and officers of credit unions to safeguard members’ deposits, and requires that credit unions be subject to a prudential oversight regime. In Trinidad and Tobago, the Central Bank is responsible for this prudential regulation and supervision. Ladies and Gentlemen, I readily admit that the skills and expertise of the Central Bank’s current pool of supervisors are biased towards regulating banks and insurance companies. In this regard, the Bank has already created a specialized unit within the Financial Institutions Supervision Department to work on development of the credit union legislation and to supervise the financial activities of credit unions. In addition, the Bank will be strengthening its supervisory capacity by recruiting persons with more in-depth knowledge and understanding of the business, governance and risk management practices of credit unions. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  As the prime regulatory agency, the Central Bank has a sacred responsibility to ensure that your members can sleep peacefully at nights, secure in the knowledge that their life savings in credit unions are well protected by sound management, effective governance and strong prudential oversight. Apart from the fiduciary argument, I would like to draw attention to the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU), which also makes the case for an agency like the Central Bank to regulate credit unions. In its July 2008 Technical Guide to the regulation and supervision of credit unions, WOCCU maintains that the ministry or agency that regulates financial institutions should also supervise credit unions. WOCCU consistently finds that credit unions supervised by the financial sector regulator enjoy greater public confidence and trust as well as stronger financial performance. Taking a broader perspective, I must point out that there are economies of scale to having one prudential regulator within a jurisdiction. Such a mega-regulator helps to minimize the risk of regulatory arbitrage and negates the need for coordination of regulation and supervisory actions among multiple regulators. Many of you may recall that this mega-regulator concept is consistent with the 2004 White Paper on Reform of the Financial System in Trinidad and Tobago which envisaged “a Single Regulatory Authority with the necessary powers and authority for the integrated regulation of the sector” in Trinidad and Tobago. Principles underlying the proposed credit union legislation Ladies and Gentlemen, I now turn to the proposed credit union legislation. At the outset, I must draw your attention to the fact that the Central Bank has engaged extensively with stakeholders on crafting a new, robust regulatory regime for credit unions. These stakeholders include the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labour and Small and Micro Enterprise Development, the Co-operative Credit Union League, the Association of Credit Union Presidents, and members from the credit union movement.  Over the past six years, the Central Bank has issued three Policy Proposal Documents (PPDs) with a view to developing the best possible legislation for the credit union sector. The first PPD was issued in 2006. It served as the basis for initial discussion and consultation with key stakeholders. The second and third PPDs were issued in 2007 and 2009, respectively. These PPDs incorporated a wide range of views from credit unions and other key actors in the credit union sector during consultations. I must mention that these consultations were well attended and stakeholders participated actively, providing relevant comments. In 2009, the Central Bank formed a committee made up of representatives of the League, the Association of Presidents, the Ministry of Finance and the Commissioner’s Office to finalize the various policy provisions for the Draft Bill as well as amendments to the Cooperative Societies Act. A Draft Credit Union Bill was sent out for consultation in November 2011. In January 2012, the Bank held information sessions on the Draft Bill with the sector. The Bank is currently reviewing comments and feedback with representatives from the League and the Association of Presidents. Ladies and Gentlemen, I must indicate that the Draft Credit Union Bill recognizes the co-operative principles, democratic structure, service to members and social goals of credit unions. Permit me to point out some examples of such recognition in the proposed legislation.  • First, the Draft Credit Union Bill recognizes that members are the ultimate decision-making body for the credit union. Appointment of the external auditor, election of fit and proper directors and approval of audited financial statements are made by members at an AGM. As such, credit union members will determine the fitness and 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  propriety of elected officers and directors and do not require approval of the Central Bank, unlike what obtains for banks and insurance companies. The Central Bank will supervise the work of the boards to ensure that the determination of fitness and propriety is effective. • Second, the Draft Credit Union Bill recognises that credit unions operate on the principle of volunteerism and the board comprises persons from the membership. As a result, there is no requirement for a quorum of independent directors on the board, as required for banks. Notwithstanding this, the Central Bank encourages boards to supplement its expertise in risk management, financial analysis and compliance, with external advisors, as may be required. • Third, the Draft Credit Union Bill affirms the democratic principle of “one vote per member”, irrespective of the number of shares held. This, therefore, removes the necessity for provisions to regulate a “controlling shareholder”, as obtains for banks and insurance companies. • Finally, the Draft Credit Union Bill upholds the principle of “service to members”. As such, credit unions can engage in non-financial activities, up to a limit. Beyond that limit, credit unions can pool their resources with other cooperatives to continue providing these services to their members, on a larger scale. Differences between the cooperative societies act and the draft credit union bill Ladies and Gentlemen, there will be fundamental differences in the approach to regulation and supervision between the Commissioner for Cooperative Development and the Central Bank. These fundamental differences are borne out in the legislation. Permit me to point out the relevant ones. First, the Commissioner is very involved in the operations of the credit union. The Commissioner approves by-laws, individual investment transactions, provision of non-financial services and the use of Reserve Funds. The Central Bank, on the other hand, has placed permitted activities, prohibitions and limits in the Draft Credit Union Bill and regulations. This removed the need for the Inspector of Financial Institutions to engage in the time-consuming task of approving individual transactions and activities for credit unions.  Second, the Cooperative Societies Act is deficient in prudential criteria, governance, enforcement/sanctions and protection of members’ funds. The prudential criteria cover capital and borrowing only and require that credit unions must establish 10 percent of their surplus in a Reserve Fund and that a borrowing limit be set annually at an AGM. By contrast, at the heart of the Draft Credit Union Bill is a regime of prudential criteria covering capital, liquidity, asset quality and earnings, borrowing, credit exposure and non-financial activities. The prudential framework is aligned with the PEARLS financial ratios which have been adopted in the main by the local credit union sector. Third, the key responsibilities of the board outlined under the Co-operative Societies Act cover preparation of the annual balance sheet, convening and voting at an AGM and election of Board members. By contrast, the Draft Credit Union Bill captures standards for effective governance of the board. It outlines fit and proper criteria for directors, term limits, consideration of multiple directorships, and annual attestation of compliance and fit and proper requirements. It also calls for board approval of all policies, assurance of arms-length basis for all transactions and the establishment of additional Risk and Investments committees to support the work of the board.  Finally, very few offences exist under the Co-operative Societies Act. These include corrupt practice and bribery, falsely obtaining, withholding or misapplying property, and dealing with property subject to a charge. Under the Draft Credit Union Bill, the Central Bank has wider enforcement authority. The Inspector of Financial Institutions may recommend, direct, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  suspend or apply for judicial management where a credit union is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner, may be illiquid or insolvent or is in violation of the Act. Lingering industry concerns Ladies and Gentlemen, despite the compelling case for regulation of credit unions by the Central Bank and extensive, broad-based stakeholder consultations on the proposed new regulatory regime, some industry concerns still linger. Most recently, the President of the Credit Union League expressed concerns about what he termed “serious deficiencies” in the proposed legislation and which could stint the growth of the credit union movement (Guardian Newspaper, February 2013). He listed the following four concerns: • Restricted term limits for directors; • Potential conflict between two regulators; • Non-recognition of the evolution of credit union services beyond “collecting people’s money and loans”; and • Regime of criminalizing violations in the Credit Union Bill that will hamper volunteerism in the movement I would like to address each concern in order to dispel, as far as practicable, any lingering fears. First, in respect of the restricted term limits for directors, I am pleased to announce that the Minister of Finance has agreed to extend the transition period from eighteen months to three years of the Act coming into effect, so as not to cause undue disruption in the governance structure for the credit union sector. In a limited impact study, the Central Bank found that the boards of many of the larger credit unions have directors who would be in excess of the initially proposed term limits, and that compliance could pose severe disruption to the functioning of boards. Second, in respect of the potential conflict between two regulators it is important to make a distinction between the regulatory role of the Commissioner of Cooperatives and that of the Central Bank. The Commissioner will continue to look after registration, membership, education and training and development of credit unions. The Central Bank will be the prudential regulator with specific emphasis on safety and soundness of credit unions. There is little, if any, potential conflict of interest. As I indicated earlier, the Commissioner and the Central Bank have worked very closely on the Draft Credit Union Bill and on amendments to the Cooperative Societies Act to make sure that there is no overlap or duplication between these two pieces of legislation. We intend to continue working very closely together in regulation of the credit union sector, each focusing on its regulatory remit and area of competence. Third, over the past few years, credit unions have, with the approval of the Commissioner for Cooperatives, ventured into non-financial services. These include travel agency services, resorts, gym facilities, daycare services, retail outlets and real estate development. We recognize that these non-core activities provide a supplementary source of earnings for credit unions and provide additional services to the credit union membership. However, these non-core activities represent a potential drain on the limited managerial capacity and expertise of many credit unions. Moreover, these non-financial activities pose risks that are outside the supervisory responsibility of the Central Bank. As a consequence, the Draft Credit Union Bill allows credit unions to provide these non-financial services subject to certain limits on revenues and assets. These limits seek to ensure that financial intermediation remains the core business of credit unions and that credit 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  unions can minimize balance sheet risks arising from non-financial activities. In fact, WOCCU recommends “the sum of non-financial investments not exceeding 5 percent of total assets”. In the event non-financial services grow beyond the proposed limits, the members of the credit union must direct the board to establish a new cooperative, singly or in conjunction with other credit unions, to continue provision of these services. I wish to emphasize that there is no prohibition in the proposed legislation against the credit union and the new cooperative having the same governance structure and composition, an allowance that was requested by the sector. Finally, the Draft Credit Union Bill makes most violations of the Act or failure to comply with a direction issued by the Bank, a criminal offence, for the credit union and the officer or director. Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to advise that, in practice, the Inspector of Financial Institutions will first call on the credit union and the officers to fix a problem, by letter of advice, recommendation or compliance direction. In giving a direction, the Inspector follows due process of the law by giving the credit union time to make representation of the cause of the violation and to submit a plan for correction. I also wish to advise that the Central Bank will not exercise the option to bring the matter before the Court where the credit union opts for the payment of an administrative fine. As such, even though the provision for criminal charges is in the law, it will be used only as a very last resort when all else has failed. Conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen, the proposed credit union legislation is an important step towards placing the credit union movement in a position of greater strength, safety and soundness. As we transition to a more robust regulatory regime, the Central Bank is using the time before the passage of new legislation to analyze the audited financial statements of credit unions that have responded to our request for copies of their statements. Over the last year, we have received statements from about 35 credit unions. We will be renewing our request shortly for more credit unions to send us their most recent audited financial statements. The Central Bank has also been encouraging credit unions to assess the impact of the proposed legislation on their operations and to share such results and any concerns with the Bank. We have had some response from the larger credit unions on the terms of their directors and some smaller credit unions who are members of the League shared their data for calculating the ratios under the prudential criteria. We encourage more credit unions to participate in these exercises which are a valuable means of orientation to the new regime. Going forward, a key institutional support to the new regulatory framework will be the establishment of a mandatory deposit insurance system for the credit union sector. Not only would the insurance system cover deposits but it must include shares which represent the vast majority of the sector’s savings, a situation that is unique to Trinidad and Tobago. In most jurisdictions, the protection fund for the credit union sector covers deposits only. We at the Central Bank expect the credit union movement to continue to play a critical financial inclusion role in our financial sector. We feel strongly, however, that more robust regulation and supervision are urgently needed to support further growth and development of credit unions. In closing, Ladies and Gentlemen, I again thank the board of Telephone Workers’ Credit Union for inviting me to its AGM, and I wish members well in their future contributions to community, the economy and national development. I thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Patrick Honohan: The European Union – financial, fiscal, economic and political challenges ahead Address by Mr Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the National Bank of Poland Bi-annual EU Presidency Lecture, Warsaw, 19 March 2013. *      *      * Let me begin by thanking Marek Belka, President of the National Bank of Poland, for inviting me to give this inaugural lecture in the National Bank’s bi-annual series during Ireland’s Presidency of the European Union.  It is not, to be sure, my first visit to Poland: I have come here for both business and leisure, and most recently had the most interesting pleasure of visiting Wroclaw during the Polish Presidency at the Informal Ecofin meeting hosted by Marek and by Jacek Rostowski.  Ireland and Poland have many cultural ties, and as you know we have welcomed a large population of Poles in Ireland over the past decade. They came during the boom years, but many have put down roots and are staying with us even in these more difficult economic times; over 2½% of Ireland’s population have Polish nationality.  I was interested to discover that, thanks to this migration flow and the associated two-way travel that follows from it, there are no fewer than 66 weekly nonstop flights between Ireland and Poland, surely a remarkable instance of European integration considering the distance involved of as much as 2000 kilometres and the relatively small population of my own country at just 4½ million. A big part of the explanation – other historical developments aside – is of course the fact that Ireland and Poland share membership in the European Union; indeed, form the Western and Eastern borders of the Union at the latitude (52°-53°N) which Dublin and Warsaw share.  Poland took the Presidency of the Union for the first time in 2011; this role has rotated now to Ireland which performs it for the seventh time in the 40 years of its membership. As you know, during these semesters, each national government, supported by the national administrative structures, seeks to progress the Council’s role in the strategic and legislative programme of the Union. Poland’s effective Presidency, in which you steered the turbulent discussions on economic governance during one of the most pressured episodes of the economic crisis, and secured agreement on reinforcing fiscal coordination through the so-called “six-pack” of legislative measures, is recalled as a strikingly successful one.  Eighteen months later, though the systemic financial crisis of the euro area is less acute, and even if employment growth has resumed in some countries, unemployment at record levels is but the most conspicuous evidence of the depth and persistence of recessionary times in Europe.  It would be astonishing if institutional deepening and reform in the economic infrastructures of the European Union were not still centre stage in the legislative agenda in 2013 and I can assure you that a large and intensive effort has been mounted by the administrative resources of the Irish economic and financial authorities to try to progress this agenda. Before mentioning some of the detailed elements of current legislative debate, let me stand back a bit, though and ask why it is that the Eurosystem has needed a relaunch. How come the great expectations for the euro as the single currency of the European Union seem not to have been fully realized? Why have some commentators been identifying the euro as a source of weakness rather than strength of the euro area economies, as well of those which, like that of Poland, are intertwined with the euro area (I see, for example, that well over half of Poland’s exports go to the euro area)? And are the reforms that are currently being 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  discussed of the correct type and sufficient in scale to set things back on the kind of path which was not only expected in advance, but up to the current crisis actually had been achieved in practice, with not only low inflation and anchored inflationary expectations, but also modest and falling debt ratios, convergence of financial market conditions, reasonably steady growth and – notably – a considerable reduction in unemployment? In case there is any doubt that a relaunch is needed, it may be useful to note that the key entry-requirement indicators of government debt, government deficit and bond yields now show considerably greater divergence than at entry (even though the entry criteria were applied in a relatively liberal manner. But what is needed is not only the kind of fiscal restraint that is clearly a prerequisite for restoring something closer to what was envisaged for these indicators as threshold levels for entry – that is the task of the six-pack and the two-pack legislative measures – but a deeper reform of policy and behaviour to ensure that the divergences do not easily recur, and construction of institutions that will help rebuild trust and confidence both to market participants and to partner countries within and outside the euro area. For this, we need to understand what went wrong. It is easy to point to the global financial crisis as the culprit, and certainly that crisis, which had its origins in the United States, has had a devastating impact. But why have the problems been particularly deep and intractable in the euro area? After all, not all euro area countries have been equally affected. Germany, to take the largest and most striking example, has emerged from the shocks of the last few years with lower unemployment than before.  And, as for the most adversely affected countries, the imbalances and excesses which they have experienced have been quite diverse. Greece’s problems have emerged as the result of large and under-appreciated fiscal deficits, Italy’s as a result of high debt and persistent lack of growth dynamism, Ireland from a banking-driven boom-and-bust cycle. What is the common feature of these and other syndromes?  This is important for us in understanding what needs deepening in a relaunch of the system, and it also, of course, is vital for a country contemplating and preparing itself for a future euro membership. I believe that the key to this mystery lies in the fact that the euro represents a commitment device, a policy straitjacket which, if accompanied by the behaviour to which the country implicitly and explicitly commits when it joins the currency union, will lead to an improved economic performance relative to what can otherwise be achieved.  The commitment is of course to policies that retain macroeconomic balance, which requires fiscal discipline, and international competitiveness in both price and non-price dimensions.  For decades, many European Union countries have had a chequered history of macroeconomic imbalances, generally resolved through devaluations at the cost of relatively high inflation, and high nominal and real interest rates, all of which contributed to growth-damaging uncertainty.  In addition to the considerable microeconomic benefits of eliminating currency conversion costs and all of the exchange rate risk for intra-euro area transactions, the main advantage of the currency union was seen to be lower inflation and interest rates, contributing to a stable growth platform.  Yet it was as if policymakers and market participants believed that the results would happen semi-automatically.  Governments would adopt restrained fiscal policies for fear of market reaction, and if they didn’t markets would quickly penalize them with interest penalties that would incentivize them to get back on track.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Likewise any loss of competitiveness due to wage rates increasing faster than the currency area would result in such quick damage to employment that such divergences would be short-lived. Above all, private capital flows could be relied upon to be stabilizing and sustainable.  With such strong forces for macroeconomic stability, what need for anyone to pay attention to fiscal and cost competitiveness?  But markets were not as effective task-masters, and they allowed the old pattern of imbalances to persist. Indeed, the very fluidity of large-scale international capital flows (partly attributable to the currency union itself, but even more – as can be seen by the parallel experiences of countries such as Iceland and Latvia – by technology-driven liberalization of finance) allowed the imbalances to become larger than ever.  The difference now was that the old adjustment device – devaluation and inflation – had been eschewed. Imbalances, allowed to emerge, had even more costly consequences when those safety valves – imperfect and corrosive though they are – were not available. High debt ratios had to be sweated down or, when this was impossible in Greece, in effect written down.  The needed fiscal contraction removed demand and triggered the double-dip of the recession in several of the most affected countries, and unemployment soared, especially to the extent that the inflexibility of nominal wage rates inhibited needed restoration of cost-competitiveness.  The solvency of banks, both those in the countries suffering the adjustment, and those which had extended large advances across borders within the currency union, came under suspicion.  On top of this, the severity of the needed adjustment made markets question the ability of some member states to stick with the single currency – a doubt whose elimination required the invention of the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme. In sum, the continued failure to maintain fiscal, cost and financial discipline in some countries, despite the implicit commitment to do so embodied in euro area membership, had much more severe consequences than they had had in the previous decades of autonomous and often weak currencies.  How can Poland ensure that life in the euro (whenever that comes about) could be accomplished without the mishaps and imbalances that have characterized several euro area countries in the financial crisis?  I believe that Ireland’s experience suggests that this can be done, and that the errors that were made could be avoided without too much difficulty, as long as the commitment required of membership is widely appreciated.  Thus one would envisage a more decisive response – with macro prudential and fiscal  tools – to the big property price and construction boom that made Ireland such a record-breaker in mid-decade; the degree to which fiscal balance was becoming dependent on boom-time revenues could have been better recognized, and public expenditure kept in check accordingly; finally, if and when things had got to the point of wide scale bank failure, crisis management could have allowed for a lower socialization of the losses.  In avoiding such pitfalls for the future, the new euro-area institutional arrangements will help, but in fact a well-managed economy has nothing to fear from the euro.  The consequences of misbehaviour in policy by those who failed to respect the commitment, have not only been for economic performance in stressed countries, but have also spilled-over into wider concerns about the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union.  Cross-border interbank lending dried-up, introducing sizable divergences between the cost of credit in different member states which, though not as wide as they were at one point, have 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  remained substantial and represent a departure from what had come to be expected from the single currency area. Credit no longer seems to flow seamlessly across borders without incurring what is de facto a country premium for the stressed countries.  It is often remarked that this is nothing more than a wholly justified risk-premium that should have been present from the start. That could be true for interest charged by the market for lending to Governments. But I am not so sure that it holds for non-Government borrowers: it seems to me that this is largely a spillover from fiscal and macro-prudential risks which cannot easily be avoided by firms in stressed countries even if their own firm-specific conditions would not warrant a high risk premium.  This is not, of course, the only country-specific national source of competitive advantage and disadvantage. Tax rates, social benefits, infrastructure, to name just a few. So the emergence of interest differentials on lending is not unique. But it is a departure from what was envisaged at the outset of the single currency and held out as an important integrating function of the euro.  And the sudden awakening of market to credit risk on lending to Governments is much more damaging now, when Governments have accumulated so much debt, than if it had been a constant from the outset.  Stressed countries have naturally turned, not only to the IMF, but also to their partners in the European Union for assistance in these circumstances. The countries that have avoided these errors have been called upon to provide financial assistance on a rather large scale to five stressed countries.  The assistance being granted is in the form of loans, but even so some taxpayers and electorates may fear that their savings are being threatened by being lent where markets have been reluctant to go. The fear seems to be that the system is having the effect of spreading the cost of policy errors in some countries to the taxpayers of countries that maintained discipline. This fear has been influencing the design of crisis management measures.  Thus, as is so often the case when it comes to the finances of stressed borrowers; neither the borrower nor the lender is content.  Herein lies the most fundamental rationale for a relaunch of the euro: the need to ensure collaborative arrangements that command the confidence of both the stressed and the strong. That confidence can underpin quicker and more comprehensive crisis management based on a stronger sense of trust, solidarity and common purpose among member states than has yet been fully in evidence. The fiscal aspect of the crisis was the first to receive attention from the point of view of reforming and strengthening institutional structures. As the successive financial assistance packages to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and now Cyprus have been put in place in conjunction with the IMF to deal with the loss of market access by those countries in the crisis, institutional deepening has also been in the works. The initial funding vehicle, the EFSF, has been succeeded by a permanent successor, the ESM, incorporating risk-sharing mechanisms based on mutual national guarantees proportional to the share of ECB capital. But that is just one dimension of the fiscal institutional reforms. I have already mentioned in passing the progress towards strengthening the surveillance of national policies and economic policy coordination through the adoption of legislative measures: the six-pack under your Presidency and the two-pack under our own, thereby building the fiscal dimension to this concept of closer collaborative arrangements. The six – pack greatly reinforces the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact with the possibility of sanctions and stronger powers for the Commission and the two – pack introduces the procedures to allow for meaningful and timely action. The Intergovernmental 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Fiscal Stability Treaty has incorporated the core principles of the Stability and Growth Pact into binding national legislation. It was passed by Referendum in Ireland in May 2012 with 60% of the vote. As for Poland, I understand that the President of Poland last month gave his assent also to this Treaty. But the crisis has above all had at its root, failures in banking and finance, and in the regulation and supervision of banks. Faced with the crisis, the ECB has stepped up to the plate with a succession of policy innovations (difficult to design in a multi-country environment) including the open-ended liquidity provision, the long-term refinancing operations, the securities market programme and its successor the OMT, specifically designed to remove redenomination risk. These have been non-standard measures designed to improve the transmission of monetary policy and thereby serving to remove obstacles to the accommodating low interest rate policy being effective throughout the euro area.  Here too (in banking and finance) structural reforms are needed alongside these conjunctural measures, and an institutional strengthening agenda is also being fleshed-out. The most immediate part of this agenda at present is the creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism for banking based in the ECB. Securing agreement on the legal texts that will form the basis of the SSM is high on the action list of the Irish Presidency. Would the SSM, had it been in place, have prevented the banking collapse? This is a tough question. While there is a lot to hope for from centralization of bank supervision – removal of the perception of national political pressures, emotional detachment from the waves of euphoria that occasionally sweep national financial systems, a cross-fertilization of supervisory perspectives from different parts of the Union to name a few aspects – it has to be acknowledged that supervisory failures across the world in the lead-up to the great financial crisis were very widespread.  Still, not creating a single supervisor was a missed opportunity at the start of the EMU and one which will yield benefits, I am convinced, down the road. In the more immediate future, I think its creation is one of the essential ingredients for building confidence in the strong countries that banking weaknesses that have been exposed in the stressed countries are not going to recur or persist because of supervisory inadequacies.  To be sure, a single resolution authority and a common deposit guarantee system will also be needed in the Banking Union when it is complete. The former will build on the current draft legislation on national resolution systems, which is being actively negotiated in this Presidency, and the latter’s importance has been underlined, I believe, by some very recent developments. Let me describe in a little more detail the progress of discussions in our Presidency. As an over-riding theme for this Presidency, Ireland seeks to be seen as “a recovery country driving recovery in Europe”. Thus, we are trying to build on our national experience through considerable domestic efforts for recovery to help consolidate fiscal and economic stability across the European scene. Ireland has long entered such endeavours inspired by certain core values: • Ireland has always upheld the Community method rather than intergovernmentalism • Ireland is strongly commited to working constructively with the European Parliament • Ireland is a long standing advocate of global institutions and of trade. (Recent examples: it is a member of the UN Human Rights Council and chaired the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2012). Apart from the financial agenda, among the specific objectives of the current Presidency – on a number of which good progress has already been made – are: 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • Support to President Van Rompuy in getting agreement on the budget for  2014–2020 and finalising negotiations with the European Parliament. • Finalising agreement on the “two-pack” of measures to enhance coordination of the budgetary process for the Euro area. • Promoting the Digital Single Market Agenda, tackling issues such as e-signatures, intellectual property rights and cyber security. • Agreement on opening a comprehensive EU-US trade deal. • A Youth Unemployment package including a Youth Guarantee, a fund to help young people into a job, apprenticeship or further education or training within 4 months of leaving school. On the Financial Services front the Irish Presidency has, in the interests of getting results for the Union as a whole, made some tactical decisions and prioritised efforts on six files for the first half of our mandate. In the coming days, we will review progress and decide priorities for the second half. This approach partly reflects a pragmatic approach from a relatively small administration but is primarily based on a realistic assessment of the decision-taking capacity of the Union’s institutions. Absolute priority has been given to all files relating to the promotion of a Banking Union as set out in the December 2012 European Council conclusions. As I have already suggested, a Banking Union, shifting supervision of banks to the European level, combined with a common system for deposit protection and integrated bank crisis management will reassure citizens and markets that a common, high level of prudential regulation is being consistently applied. It will help build the necessary trust between member states which is a pre-condition for the introduction of common financial arrangements. This will pave the way towards the use of the ESM as a public backstop to directly recapitalise banks and help break the negative feedback loop between banks and their sovereigns. I will say a little about progress on the Banking Union files: CRD IV Agreement on CRD IV (when it is confirmed) will mean that Europe can fulfil the requirements of Basel III and its G20 commitments to greatly strengthen the prudential requirements for banks, and improve governance and remuneration practices. It will also be a large step forward in the completion of the single rulebook. A huge effort has been put into getting final agreement on CRD IV. This has been a massive undertaking which has absorbed the energies of many Presidencies including the Polish. In the first 8 weeks our Presidency held 7 Council Working Party meetings, 5 Political Trilogues and a large number of technical Trilogues before reaching outline overall agreement with the Parliament on 28 February and in the Council on 5th March. Final formal agreement (including clarification of a number of technical drafting points) is in sight. Single supervisory mechanism The SSM, the transfer to the European level of key supervisory tasks for banks, is designed to provide strong and consistent supervision across the Euro Area. As I mentioned, it holds the promise of removing local politics from the enforcement of bank supervision and will lever a diversity of supervisory experience – best practice across Europe. Most importantly it will help to break the link between sovereigns and banks. There have been 10 Political Trilogues and 8 meetings of the Ad Hoc Working Party. Good progress has been made on the ECB Regulation and examination of the EBA Regulation is under way. The contours of an agreement are emerging. Intensive negotiations and technical work is scheduled to continue for the coming weeks and Parliament is geared to conclude by 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  the end of the month. A particular pressure is the need to allow sufficient time for the German parliamentary process of ratification to conclude before Bundestag dissolution on 5 July. Extensive preparations are well under way in the ECB to take responsibility for supervision within 12 months of final agreement on the Regulations. Crisis management: bank recovery and resolution Even if the European Commission’s estimate that banking collapses have led to over €4.5 trillion (or 37% EU GDP) of state aid going to distressed financial institutions between October 2008 and October 2011 adopts the most expansive possible definition (and is far greater than the likely ultimate fiscal cost of the crisis), it is clear that crisis management and resolution has entailed extremely high budgetary costs, and even higher overall economic costs – crippling in the case of some countries. The Recovery and Resolution proposal (relating to national crisis resolution, and not specifically to a Union-wide, or euro area-wide mechanism) would ensure that in future national authorities will have the means to intervene decisively before problems occur and early on in the process if they do. They could also ensure that the cost of restructuring and resolving failing banks falls on the owners and creditors and not on taxpayers. The December Summit asked the Council to agree this dossier by end March and for Trilogies to be completed before June. This is a very tight schedule indeed. The Commission proposal dates from June 2012. The Presidency has conducted intensive work teasing out and clarifying the issues. Principally they are: • the balance of power between home and host authorities in group scenarios and the role of the EBA in mediation  • financing and funding arrangements • bail-in; its scope and possible exclusions • the use of Deposit Guarantee Schemes in bail-in • the transposition date for the bail-in tool • possible inclusion of public intervention tools in the Directive  Discussions to date within the Council have been technical and slow moving and it is only recently that a compromise text covering all the elements has been tabled. We now have a tool box which is understood and which can work but Member States have not addressed the cost of the compromise needed to achieve a workable regime. Now that the issues have been clarified it is time for the member states to begin to take decisions. Related to this is the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive which aims to significantly enhance depositors’ confidence by introducing a higher level of coverage, faster payout and more credible funding of the schemes. However, Member States are unwilling to restart negotiations of this proposal until the Bank Resolution package is nearer conclusion – in particular its treatment of funding. The European Council asked for work on this dossier to be accelerated so that it can be adopted in line with Bank Recovery and Resolution. Clearly the Recovery and Resolution proposal and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme will be pressure points for the remainder of the Irish Presidency. Outside of the Banking Union priority we are focusing on certain Markets and Consumer files and I will deal briefly with them. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  MiFID II/MiFIR This proposal aims to make financial markets more efficient, resilient and transparent and to respond to the challenges of new trading venues, products and technological developments. Following an intensive round of bilaterals the Presidency has issued 3 compromise texts in the hope of getting agreement on a General Council approach by April so as to allow engagement with an impatient Parliament to begin. There are important differences between key member states on three main issues • transparency for equity trading venues  • rules for the Organised Trading Facility category • non-discriminatory clearing access. Having said that, discussions are beginning to go in the right direction as Member States realise they have to finalise their positions soon. Market abuse regulation The issue of market abuse has risen up the agenda especially for the Parliament who are linking it to public concern about the manipulation of benchmarks including LIBOR. Steady progress is being made and depending on resources the file may be taken forward in a drive for agreement in the second half of the Presidency. The main issue to get right is the interaction within the Regulation between criminal and administrative regimes. Central securities depositories regulation. This regulation aims to bring more safety and efficiency to security settlement in Europe. It is also linked to the introduction of T2S on schedule in 2015. The Presidency is carrying out a technical review and may allocate additional resources to advance this file in the latter half of the Presidency. There are a number of issues on which it will be quite difficult to achieve compromise including whether banking services should be separated from core CSD services and on whether to include provisions on conflict of laws Consumers Within the broad consumer agenda the Irish Presidency is concentrating its resources on getting agreement on the Mortgage Credit Directive. The Directive would facilitate cross border activity, enhance consumer protection and ensure more responsible mortgage lending. There have been a large number of Council Working Party meetings and Trilogues. Good progress is being made but there are a considerable number of outstanding issues. These include FX lending, tying practices, conduct of business requirements, the treatment of variable interest and loan rates and early repayment. The Presidency is intent on reaching agreement. It hopes that the willingness to negotiate and compromise which was earlier expressed by all institutions – Council, Parliament and Commission – begins to be translated into concrete results. ECOFIN The next major event for the Presidency will be the informal ECOFIN meeting in Dublin  12–13 April. Among the topics for discussion I expect that Ministers and Governors will be wanting to take a strategic view in their discussions on Banking Union; there is also the opportunity to have a discussion on Long Term Financing of the European Economy, an issue which may have been a bit neglected in the crisis, but is to be the subject of a forthcoming Commission Green Paper (which is expected mid-March). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  In these difficult times, Jean Monnet’s famous remark – true not only for our continent and the great endeavour that he and others launched so effectively – “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises” should be a leitmotiv for our thinking now. This is not a time for stop-gaps, but for ensuring that each policy choice that is made is guided, not only by short-term expediency, but by a clear vision of where Europe is going. Europe is far more than an economic, budgetary and financial entity, but it is in these fields that current challenges inevitably dominate official decision-making now. I hope not to sound sycophantic, but I have to say that I think that the proposals for a new architecture – for Union in the financial, fiscal, economic and political domains – which have been made by the four Presidents of the European Council, the European Commission, the Eurogroup and the ECB last Summer, hit the nail on the head, and sketched the way in which a new European framework must emerge, heralding a greater sharing of sovereignty combined with risk sharing and financial backstops. This is a viable path which, if we follow it to its conclusion, will help replace the somewhat fraught and crisis-prone regime in which we have been living for the past half-decade. To recall, this vision incorporates • an integrated financial framework – Banking Union – to ensure financial stability • an integrated budgetary framework – Fiscal Union – ensuring coordination and solidarity • an integrated economic policy framework – Economic Union – to promote growth, employment and competitiveness • the necessary democratic legitimacy and accountability – Political Union   What is needed, therefore, is a staged process, a mutually reinforcing series of carefully sequenced steps which will combine substantial ambition with careful balancing in each phase. Moves towards more responsibility and economic discipline should be combined with more solidarity and financial support. Deeper integration of regulation and policy must be accompanied by political integration to ensure democratic legitimacy and accountability.  Fine words, you will say, but who can doubt the need for this – including the Political Integration dimension which really is well beyond my mandate, not to say my competence. After all, Jean Claude Juncker (drawing on his long-term experience as President of the Eurogroup) put it succinctly: “Ministers know what measures need to be taken but do not know how they can be subsequently re-elected.”  It will not be enough to provide in the future for a greater involvement of the European Parliament, however essential that may be. Decisions on national budgets traditionally have been at the heart of Member States’ parliamentary democracies; a stronger European dimension and mechanisms will have to be found by which national parliaments can be brought further into the European decision making process. The crisis, its resolution and the long term development of the EMU have both a European and a domestic dimension. Onto the national political system level falls the challenge of striking a new social contract, reorienting expenditure, modernising tax systems, promoting flexibility, strengthening competitiveness. In Ireland we believe that if we are to stay on the path to a successful consolidation and adjustment continued efforts are needed at both national and European levels. Other countries are facing or may face the same challenges. The coming years will test the ability of all our leaders to manage successfully in the interaction between the national and the European.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jörg Asmussen: Is Europe on the right track? Speech by Mr Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Deutsche Bank Women in European Business conference “Competition versus Coalition – the quest for growth?”, Frankfurt am Main, 20 March 2013. *      *      * Dear Ms. Siebert, Dear Mr. Leithner, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at the Women in European Business Conference organised by Deutsche Bank. The topic of this year’s conference – the quest for growth – could scarcely be more relevant for Europe today. As this audience knows better than most, the low growth environment is posing serious challenges for businesses. Uncertainty about the future is a drag on confidence and a barrier to new investment. It causes banks to cut back on lending, especially to small- and medium-sized firms, which are critical to help growth rebound. And above all, low growth is deeply affecting the lives of ordinary people in Europe. As a result, many are frustrated, and some are even desperate. They doubt whether the European strategy to deal with the crisis is the right one. They are asking: “Will we ever come out of it, with ever more cuts and austerity?” And it is right and legitimate that they are asking this. “Power of the masses” is a key theme of this conference. We are democratic societies in Europe and these important choices about the future of our countries and our monetary union require a proper public debate. But this debate also needs to be based on substance. Rage alone does not solve our problems. Just being angry at politicians or officials, even if justified, does not help citizens understand the crisis. People need to be presented with the real choices facing them – even if that means taking hard decisions or making sacrifices. Offering allegedly easy solutions, or presenting false alternatives, abandons the debate to populists and gambles with the long-term prosperity of our societies. So today I would like to present my view on the choices that are facing Europe – and in doing so, to expose some of the myths and misconceptions about the European approach to managing the crisis. Concretely, I want to answer two questions: • First, are there alternatives to the current strategy, and if so, what are their real consequences? • Second, are we condemned to a “lost decade”, or can we find new sources of growth to lift us out of the crisis? 1. The reality of the alternatives Policy-makers sometimes speak about certain courses of action as being without alternatives – “alternativlos” as we say in German. Of course, this is not true. There always are alternatives. The question is whether they are superior, especially when assessing their likely impact and longer-term consequences. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  So let me begin by looking at those alternatives. As you know, one pillar of the crisis response in Europe has been to consolidate government budgets. Progress has so far been good: the European Commission estimates that, by the end of this year, the euro area as a whole will have a budget deficit below 3% of GDP. But this progress has also had costs in the short term: growth has turned out to be lower than forecast and unemployment has risen steeply. Almost 19 million people in the euro area are currently without jobs – this includes almost one in every four young people. In the face of this hardship, the strategy of reducing deficits has come under increasing criticism from commentators and politicians. Some now urge an “exit from the austerity cage”. Others claim that, by continuing to cut deficits when growth is so low, policy-makers are ignoring the evidence, even being ideological. To exit the crisis, they say, Europe must engage in an urgent change of course: more time, less austerity; more public money, less reform. Let me be clear: I am also very concerned by the high level of unemployment. I would also like to see stronger growth. But before proposing to change course, we need to think through the consequences. This is what responsible policymaking means. And put simply, the consequence of stopping cutting deficits is to increase public debts. Is this a feasible or sustainable solution to our problems? The real consequences of changing course In my view, the answer is “no”. First, regardless of its merits, such a strategy would only work if private investors were willing to finance higher borrowing at reasonable rates. And that is certainly a big “if”, especially for countries whose debts are already very high and rising. Second, it is an illusion to think that more debt is the answer to this debt crisis. Recent research has shown that high public debt levels in the euro area hamper growth, with a serious negative effect starting when debt exceeds 90% of GDP. Average euro area public debt is already above that level – almost 95% of GDP – so adding more debt will only put us further into the danger zone. Third, a strategy of increasing debt simply pushes problems in to the future. Any benefits for the current generation come at the expense of future generations. Higher borrowing today means higher interest payments tomorrow – which have to be paid off with the taxes of tomorrow’s citizens. Moreover, the more today’s generation consumes, the more future generations will have to save to get the debt level back down again. And they will have to do this: as part of the new EU debt rule, all euro area countries are legally bound to start reducing their public debts below 60% of GDP. To give a sense of what this means, take the example of Italy. Public debt is almost 130% of GDP, so it will have to be more than halved by the next generation to abide by the debt limit. Around 80 billion euros a year goes on debt service – this is more than 10% of the annual budget, which is not being spent on education or infrastructure. On top of this, future generations will face a number of hidden costs that have not yet been factored into the debt figures. These include the effects of an ageing society and the unknown consequences of a changing climate. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  To take the example of Germany, the European Commission projects in its 2012 Ageing Report that the working age population will fall by more than 30% by 2060. At the same time, its age-related spending will continue to increase. This means that, year after year, there will be an ever smaller number of workers supporting an ever larger social security system. Our obligation to future generations In other words, future generations are already carrying major burden. Is it fair to them, by increasing debt today, to make it heavier still? The economist John Maynard Keynes famously dismissed long-term considerations with the argument that “in the long-run we’re all dead”. This is true – we are, but our children and grandchildren are not. By ensuring fiscal soundness today, we represent their voice in the current debate. To sum up, I question the benefits of changing course, not because I am satisfied with the current situation, but because the alternatives available are worse. They mean placing short-term expediency over long-term sustainability – which, for me, is the opposite of responsible policy-making. Citizens have to take decisions of great importance about their future – most directly so when they are asked to at the ballot box. By casting their votes, they make choices that will not only determine their lives, but also those of the generations to come. They deserve to have the full picture of the alternatives they are facing before they do. 2. The potential of the European strategy But citizens still rightly ask: where will growth come from? This leads me to the second theme of my address today. Is the euro area condemned to a “lost decade” of low growth and high unemployment? Or are there new sources of growth we can exploit to get out of this crisis? Here, the answer depends on governments themselves. The truth is that they are not out of options when it comes to growth. There are new sources of growth that can be tapped, even while budgets are being cut. But to do so, they have to implement the other pillar of the European strategy. They have to enact deep-rooted economic reforms that increase the potential of their economies to grow. Reforms to open markets, increase competition, and remove bureaucracy. Reforms to advance innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, and help public administration actually serve the public. These reforms are not easy to implement. They require tough choices, perseverance to confront vested interests, and patience for the effects to become visible. Reforms as the path to growth… But their potential is huge. To give a sense of what can be achieved, recent research from the IMF1 finds that euro area countries could boost their GDP by more than 3% over five years by opening markets to competition and reforming tax systems. And they could also do a lot to support growth by removing the remaining barriers to a Single Market in Europe – in particular by completing the Single Market in services.                                                 1 Barkbu, B., Rahman, J., Valdés, R., “Fostering Growth in Europe Now”, IMF Staff Discussion Note, June 2012 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The European Commission estimates that implementing the Services Directive – which covers activities that make up around 40% of EU GDP – could reap additional gains of 330 billion euro, or more than 2.5% of EU GDP, over five to ten years. And this only requires implementing legislation that has already been agreed. …and fairness Higher growth is not the only benefit from reforms: they also contribute to a social fairness. As the OECD Going for Growth 2012 report put it, this is the “Double Dividend” of structural reforms. Commentators who criticise the social consequences of the European strategy often forget this element and focus only on the effect of budget cuts – which can sometimes fall hardest on vulnerable groups in society. But well-designed reforms can have the opposite effect: they can in fact create opportunities for people on the margins of society. Let me allude to this: In Spain, there is a rigid two-tier labour market which protects insiders. This means that young people, on flexible contracts, bear the burden of an economic downturn. As a result, almost 6 out of 10 are currently unemployed. In another country, the administration of tax collection is weak which leads to enormous amounts of tax arrears. As a result, ordinary people who are taxed on their salaries have to pay more to make up the difference. These are both cases where lack of reforms leads to unfair outcomes – and so where structural reforms could help towards a fairer society. Ultimately, with structural reforms, the winners outnumber the potential losers. It is time this message gets more attention. The never-ending race However, we should not fall into the trap of thinking that it is only struggling countries that need to take hard decisions. We are all competing today, both within Europe and with the rest of the world. There can be no sitting back, for any country. Germany was a decade ago called “the Sick Man of Europe”; people were wondering publicly if “Germany can be saved”. Since then, the country has become a showcase of how well-designed reforms can turn the situation around. But this example also serves as warning – others can just as quickly catch up. If struggling countries continue to pursue ambitious reforms, and Germany rests on its laurels, it could once again be this country left in the slow lane. So it also needs to tap new sources of growth, like professional services, that remain unreformed. 3. Conclusion Let me now conclude. The challenge avoiding false alternatives, and taking the hard decisions, is not a new one. Niccolo Machiavelli observed in the 16th century that, “There is nothing more difficult to carry out than to institute a new order of things. Because the reformer has for enemies all those who have profited under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.”2                                                  2 Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince, 1532 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  We at the ECB are no different: we also have structural problems to address. And since I am speaking at the “Women in European Business” conference, let me focus on one in particular: the underrepresentation of female staff in our management positions and governing bodies. For a very long time, I was personally not in favour of any kind of affirmative action, because I was convinced that qualified women would eventually make their way to the top. But I have come to realise that this is not the case – neither in the working environments I am familiar with, nor on a wider scale. I was struck when I heard that it will take more than 70 years to achieve gender-balance in the UK’s largest 100 companies if the current rate of change is maintained.3 The ECB’s Executive Board recently discussed enhancing gender diversity in our management and decided that, from now on, we will not only talk about diversity – we will act. All studies show that the commitment from the top is key to bringing about change. The commitment is there – we want new measures and the board has asked its Human Resources department to provide these to us. Other international financial institutions like the IMF and the EIB as well as the European Commission are more advanced and have introduced gender targets, which define specific quantitative – albeit non-binding – goals for employing women at various levels. We think that we can learn from the experience of these institutions and that their targets may serve as a benchmark for us. This marks a significant change, especially in the generally rather conservative world of central banking. All change implies a challenge, especially for those at the top of the organisation. But leadership must be challenged to keep it relevant – which is another theme of this conference. The key issue is how, when challenged, it answers. The current concerns about where Europe is heading are a challenge to our leadership. They have to be properly answered. Not by resorting to populism or false alternatives – but by reaffirming, clearly and honestly, why the path we are taking is the right one. Thank you for your attention.                                                  3 Equality and Human rights Commission, 2008 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Spencer Dale: Inflation and growth – what role for monetary policy? Speech by Mr Spencer Dale, Executive Director, Monetary Policy, and Chief Economist of the Bank of England, to the Asian Business Association and the Chinese Business Association of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bank of England, London, 15 March 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank Stephen Burgess, Matt Trott and Garry Young for their considerable help in preparing this speech. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the other members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Monetary policy is under the spotlight. The previously sedate world inhabited by middle aged, grey suited – too often, male – central bankers has been turned upside down by the financial crisis. A global debate is raging about the role monetary policymakers can – and should – be playing in trying to stimulate growth in their economies. Here in the UK, the breadth and urgency of that debate is unlike anything we have seen since the birth of inflation targeting 21 years ago. Nobody should be surprised by this. Our recovery from the financial crisis is proving to be long and arduous. At the same time, inflation remains stubbornly above target. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) faces tough choices as it tries to both support the recovery and bring inflation down. And away from home, central banking is undergoing considerable change: both the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the United States and the Bank of Japan have recently made policy changes that emphasise their commitment to provide further monetary stimulus until their economies recover.  Against that backdrop, people are understandably asking what role monetary policy in the UK should play in determining growth and inflation? This is an important debate and one that is likely to be central to economic policymaking over the next few years. What I would like to do today is to offer some of my own thoughts on this issue. I want to focus on two aspects in particular. The first concerns the objectives of monetary policy. The inflation target, given to the MPC by the UK government, states that our primary objective is to ensure that CPI inflation is equal to 2%. But it also makes clear that, in so doing, we should be mindful of the implications that our policy actions have for growth and employment. How should we go about reconciling those different objectives?  The second issue relates to the current operation of monetary policy. What should we make of the view, repeated in many quarters, that the trade off between growth and inflation may be unusually favourable in present circumstances. That we could buy quite a bit of extra growth at little or no cost in terms of higher inflation? Do such free lunches really exist? The two objectives of monetary policy Let’s start with the objectives of monetary policy and the mission of the MPC to hit the 2% inflation target but to do so in a way that supports growth and employment. Those twin objectives were highlighted starkly only last month by the Committee’s reaction to its updated forecast for inflation contained in the February Inflation Report. Inflation was projected to rise further in the near-term – to above 3% in the second half of this year – and to remain above the 2% target for the next two years or so. But rather than tighten policy, we issued a statement explaining that, in present circumstances, we thought it appropriate to bring inflation back to target more slowly than usual.  Our reaction was partly driven by the judgement that this protracted period of above-target inflation would, for the most part, reflect higher university tuition fees and domestic energy 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  bills. Importantly, these price rises are largely the consequence of regulatory decisions, rather than market forces. In contrast, costs and price pressures resulting from the balance of demand and supply in the domestic economy looked to be well contained. Although the inflationary impact of these higher administered and regulated prices is likely to persist for several years – as is the impact of the recent weakening of sterling which is also pushing up on inflation – they are likely to wane over time. As such, inflation was expected to fall back to around the 2% target by the end of 2015. But the Committee was also explicit that its willingness to tolerate this period of above-target inflation was driven by the weakness in our economy and by the concern that attempting to bring inflation back to target more quickly would risk derailing the recovery. Indeed, this desire to support growth as well as to control inflation has been characteristic of the MPC’s behaviour since the onset of the financial crisis. CPI inflation has been above its 2% target for much of the past 5 years, but during that period we have cut Bank Rate from over 5% to 0.5%, we have conducted an asset purchase programme – QE – on a scale equivalent to almost 25% of nominal GDP, and we have launched the Funding for Lending Scheme to boost credit growth to the real economy. I accept that for much of this period the Committee expected inflation to fall back to target more quickly that it actually did. Even so, it remains the case that monetary policy was loosened very aggressively at a time when inflation was persistently above target in the near certain knowledge that not doing so would lead to a deeper and potentially much more painful recession. The suggestion made in some quarters that the MPC has slavishly followed the inflation target in recent years – that it has been fixated with inflation at the expense of growth and employment – is simply at odds with the facts. Based on the MPC’s central projection for inflation published last month, over the decade to the end of 2015, CPI inflation will average close to 3%. It will have been above its 2% target for 90% of that time, and above 3% for 40% of the time.  Yes: some of this might be the result of poor forecasting. But much more important was the recognition that a lower profile for inflation was possible only by tightening monetary policy at the cost of an even deeper recession and an even larger rise in unemployment.  Monetary policy has been on the frontline in supporting our economy through the financial crisis and it continues to be so. Indeed, it is striking that while some criticise the MPC for focussing too narrowly on inflation, others argue that we’ve worried too much about the real economy and taken our eye off the inflationary ball. “Is the MPC’s job to hit the inflation target or not”, they ask? Has the inflation target become a sham? The remit given to the Monetary Policy Committee makes clear that our job is to hit the 2% inflation target. But it also acknowledges that inflation will on occasions deviate from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances, and that “...attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output”.1 Although the language is arcane, the meaning is clear: monetary policy should try to prevent damaging booms and busts in output and employment. This secondary objective matters and has been central to the recent conduct of monetary policy. To repeat: we could have delivered lower inflation over recent years, but only at the                                                 1 The relevant clause of the remit states “The framework is based on the recognition that the actual inflation  rate will on occasions depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Attempts to keep  inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output.” See http://www.hmtreasury.gov.uk/d/open_letter_from_chx_to_boe_22032011.pdf 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  expense of providing less support to growth and employment in the midst of the most significant economic downturn of our generation. That monetary policy should be concerned with growth as well as inflation is nothing new. Indeed, way back in 1997 – the year that the MPC was first established – Mervyn King, then just the lowly Chief Economist of the Bank of England, referred to the value of the “constrained discretion” built into the inflation targeting regime.2 The “discretion” relates to the speed with which inflation is returned to target. In response to certain kinds of developments – in the jargon, so-called “supply shocks” that move output and inflation in opposite directions – inflation can be returned to target relatively slowly in order to minimise harmful fluctuations in output. But this is subject to the “constraint” that inflation ultimately has to be returned to the target and has to be done so in such a way that maintains the target’s credibility. Inflation targeting is not a sham: the discipline of the inflation target is paramount. But it can be operated in a manner that also supports output and employment as long as – and only as long as – our credibility is maintained. Without credibility there can be no discretion.  This concern with the consequences for growth and employment within an inflation targeting regime is sometimes referred to as “output smoothing”. Monetary policy does not have the ability to affect the level of output in the long-run, but it can help to smooth out cyclical variations. More recently, it has underpinned references to “flexible inflation targeting”: the MPC has the flexibility to vary the speed with which inflation is returned to target depending on the circumstances. Most colourfully was the observation, again made by Mervyn King, that an inflation target does not compel policymakers to behave like “inflation nutters”: there is scope to care about stabilising output and employment as well as controlling inflation.3  That monetary policymakers should be concerned with the implications of their actions for the real economy – for the growth of output and for the strength of employment – must surely seem right to all of us. The late Eddie George – who, together with Mervyn King, perhaps did more than anyone to cement the importance at the Bank of England of low and stable inflation – stressed repeatedly that low inflation “is not an end in itself .... [it is] a necessary means to the end of sustainable growth of output and higher living standards”.4 It’s important that we don’t lose sight of this overriding aim. Eddie was equally clear that, in the long run, the best contribution that monetary policy could make to achieving a prosperous and vibrant economy was to deliver enduring price stability. He had seen at first hand the pernicious costs of the high and variable inflation of the 70s and 80s: companies and households unable to budget and plan efficiently; resources misallocated; long-term contracts avoided for fear that large swings in inflation would end up biting one party or the other. The value of hard-earned savings eroded. Out of that pain and misery emerged a consensus – a hard won consensus – that low and stable inflation was a prerequisite for economic prosperity. More recently, though, there have been some worrying signs that cracks may be appearing in that consensus. A sense that inflation is somehow yesterday’s war. That central banks should focus more on growth. That a period of higher inflation may even aid the recovery. This is dangerous talk.  It sometimes feels like we’ve been here before. One of the mistakes made by policymakers in the late 1960s was to allow inflation to get out of control after nearly two decades of price                                                 2 King (1997), “Inflation targeting 5 years on”, speech given at the London School of Economics. 3 King (1997), “Changes in UK monetary policy: Rules and discretion in practice”, Journal of Monetary Economics. 4 George (1999), Annual Cornwall Lecture. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  stability. As Sir Alec Cairncross, who worked in a host of senior economic roles in the heart of the civil service during this period, put it “...governments in the last years of the 1960s …allowed inflation expectations to develop that proved increasingly difficult to extinguish” (Cairncross 1992). There is little doubt that policymakers of that time had a strong aversion to inflation, but they were complacent about the risks posed by further stimulus. It would be irresponsible to repeat the same mistakes again. How do we ensure that the lessons of yesteryear are not forgotten? That a period of relative price stability does not breed complacency? That the collective national memory is maintained? A key part of the answer can be found in the role of regimes and institutions.5 Individual policymakers and officials come and go. Intellectual ideas pop in and out of fashion. The inflation target and the MPC are the result of a long and painful search for a credible money anchor. They provide the memory to ensure that we don’t return to the inefficiency and inequity of the 70s and 80s. They provide the memory that underpins the consensus that low and stable inflation is a perquisite for economic prosperity. And they provide the memory that guards against some of the dangerous talk of late. Let me sum up this section on the twin objectives of monetary policy.  The MPC has objectives for growth as well as for inflation. The current inflation targeting regime provides considerable flexibility for the MPC to support output and employment. And in recent years, the MPC has used that flexibility to the full. Indeed, some have argued excessively so. The MPC has been at the forefront in supporting growth and employment and continues to be so. But that flexibility is constrained by the discipline that monetary policy must be set in a manner consistent with inflation coming back to its target. Without that credibility, monetary policy wouldn’t have the flexibility to support the real economy. And ultimately delivering low and stable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to achieving a robust and sustainable recovery. The trade off between growth and inflation Let me turn now to the second issue I wanted to discuss today which concerns the operation of monetary policy and, in particular, the likely trade-off between growth and inflation in the current environment.  As I said, in February the MPC made clear that we thought it appropriate to bring inflation back to target more slowly than usual in order to support the nascent recovery. But is there a case for monetary policy going even further? What if, as some commentators have claimed, it were possible for the MPC to inject additional monetary stimulus, thereby providing even greater support to growth, with relatively little consequence for inflation. Stronger growth with little or no higher inflation: surely that would be a good use of the MPC’s flexibility? There are two strands of argument put forward as to why the current trade-off between growth and inflation may be unusually favourable.  The first is that cost and price pressures in the current environment may be relatively insensitive to the degree of slack in our economy. If that were the case, the economy could grow relatively rapidly, absorbing spare resources and capacity, without putting much upward pressure on wages and prices. In economists’ speak, the so-called Phillips curve – which sketches out the relationship between spare capacity and cost and price pressures – may be relatively flat at the moment.                                                 5 King (2012) and Tucker (2012) make similar arguments in the context of financial stability and the role that the newly formed Financial Policy Committee can play in this respect. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The second possibility is that the effective capacity of the economy to supply goods and services depends on the state of demand: the stronger the demand, the greater somehow the capacity of companies and employees to meet it. The likely responsiveness of supply to an increase in demand, it’s argued, means that it would be possible for the economy to grow relatively rapidly without significantly reducing the degree of slack in the economy and so without adding markedly to cost and price pressures. Let’s consider briefly each of these possibilities in turn. The suggestion that the Phillips curve may be relatively flat appears, at least at first blush, to be consistent with our experience over recent years. Following the worst recession in living memory, our economy has barely grown over the past two years. Output is well below its pre-crisis level, unemployment close to 8%. But inflation remains stubbornly above target.  The trade-off between output and inflation has indeed been remarkably flat. But that doesn’t mean that the flatness of this trade-off can be relied upon to continue in the future: it depends on why inflation has been so sticky. Much of the slack in our economy is concentrated in the labour market, where unemployment remains painfully elevated. And, as would be expected, that higher unemployment has been associated with a marked moderation in wage growth. Indeed, as shown in Chart 1, the relationship between wages and unemployment over the past three years looks pretty similar to what we experienced in the mid-90s when the unemployment rate was similar to what it is today. There is no strong evidence to suggest that the wage Phillips curve in the UK is flatter now than it was twenty years ago.6  If not in the labour market, is it possible that spare capacity within companies may be having less impact than usual on pricing decisions? Maybe, especially if cash-struck companies are less willing or able to cut their prices in order to utilise spare capacity and gain market share. But to the best we can tell from surveys measures and the intelligence gathered by our network of Agents, the current margin of spare capacity within companies is not particularly pronounced. So even if companies’ pricing strategies have become less sensitive to space capacity, this is unlikely to explain much of the recent stickiness in inflation. All told, I’m not particularly persuaded that the relationship between economic slack and cost and price pressures has become unusually weak. Wage growth has moderated broadly as expected given the rise in unemployment. And there does not appear to be a significant margin of spare capacity within companies.  What is unusual is that the moderation in wage growth has not been reflected in a corresponding fall in domestic cost pressures. From an accounting perspective, that reflects the unprecedented weakness in productivity in recent years. The level of private sector productivity is around 15% below the level implied by a continuation of its pre-crisis trend. This weakness in productivity has meant that, despite muted pay growth, unit labour costs  – the single biggest determinant of companies’ costs – have grown at or above their historical rate for much of the four years since the financial crisis. And indeed, it’s this weakness of productivity that underpins the second argument put forward for why the relationship between growth and inflation may currently be unusually favourable. The suggestion here is that the recent stagnation in productivity – and of the supply side of our economy more generally – is in large part a direct consequence of demand weakness. If only demand were to pickup, this – on its own – would prompt an increase in the effective supply capacity of companies. The economy could recover without significantly reducing the degree of spare capacity and with little or no additional inflation.                                                 6 My MPC colleague Ben Broadbent made a similar point in a speech last year (Broadbent 2012).  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The possibility that persistent demand weakness may erode supply capacity is not new. Indeed, it was central to the economic doldrums that characterised our economy in the first part of the 1990s. But what is different is that many of the channels which were important in detracting from our supply capacity then don’t seem to be operating particularly strongly today. In particular, the scourge of long-term unemployment and of discouraged job seekers leaving the labour market that typified the malaise of the early 90s has been in far less evidence in this downturn. The rate at which the long-term unemployed are able to move back into employment has remained around its historical average (Chart 2). And labour market participation has held up pretty well (Chart 3). Likewise, the surge in corporate insolvencies and associated increase in capital scrapping seen in the early 90s has not been repeated (Chart 4). If demand deficiency is weighing on the supply side of our economy, it’s doing so via different channels than in the past. But that is not to deny that it may be happening.  There are a number of other mechanisms through which persistent demand weakness may be eating away at the effective supply capacity of our economy. Indeed, many of you may have experienced these firsthand. The need to retain core skills and maintain minimum staffing levels means that as demand falls some companies – especially smaller companies – have not been able to reduce their workforces by a corresponding amount. Others choose to hold on to experienced workers, even if currently underutilised, for fear of losing valuable experience and knowhow. Companies comment to us that the time and resources needed to win new business and secure contracts has increased sharply in the face of weak demand.7  I’m sure that these mechanisms and many more like them are at work today. But are they sufficiently strong for us to be confident that the likely relationship between growth and inflation would be unusually favourable were demand to increase strongly? Why should these mechanisms be so much more pronounced now than in previous recessions? Wouldn’t most of them have seemed equally important in the past? I find it hard to believe that these types of effects are the entire – or even the main – explanation for the weakness in productivity.  What is unusual about this downturn is that it has been associated with a severe and prolonged financial crisis. Several of our banks are still not in a position to lend normally. Many firms have had to economise on working capital as the cost has increased and the availability reduced. The ability of many SMEs to raise finance to fund new investments or business expansion has been constrained. The efficiency with which banks have been able (or willing) to reallocate funds from outdated businesses and sectors towards new and dynamic companies has been stunted. It seems implausible to assume that the impairment of our banking system – the very life blood of our market economy – has not affected the productivity and general efficiency with which companies operate.8 If that is the case, we may be less confident that the supply capacity of our economy will pickup markedly purely in response to an increase in demand, unless and until some of these credit frictions are repaired. Where does all this leave us? The argument that it’s possible to grow the economy without much increase in inflation is, of course, seductive and enticing. It’s like being offered a free lunch. And yes, there are some grounds for thinking that the trade-off between growth and inflation may well be unusually favourable. But how strong those mechanisms actually are is far from clear. And it seems                                                 7 For a more detailed discussion of some of these points, see McCafferty (2013). 8 There are a number of empirical studies that suggest financial crisis can have material effects on productivity and output. See, for example, Furceri, D and Mouragane, A (2009), Oulton, N and Sebastía-Barriel, M (2013), IMF World Economic Outlook (2009). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  particularly optimistic to assume that the financial crisis and the near crippling of our banking system has played little role in the recent limp supply-side performance of our economy. Taken to its limit, the argument that monetary policy can be used to expand demand with little or no implications for inflation challenges the consensus that the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the long-term health and prosperity of the economy is to deliver price stability. That consensus is based on painful experience that monetary policy can’t affect the level of output in the long run. That we can’t generate permanently higher output and permanently higher employment simply by printing more money.9 We should be nervous about how quickly we overturn that consensus. Conclusion and summary Let me conclude. The financial crisis has thrust the rather reserved world of central banking and monetary policy into the spotlight. That is both understandable and healthy. Monetary policy failed to prevent the financial crisis. And in many countries, including the UK, it has failed to stimulate the growth that we all long to see. It’s only right that inflation targeting – the dominant paradigm governing the operation of monetary policy in much of the industrialised world – should be questioned and challenged. And to my mind it has a good story to tell. The inflation target ensures that the primary objective of monetary policy is to deliver price stability. But it affords the flexibility that it can be operated in such a way as to support output and employment. The MPC has used that flexibility to the full in recent years: it has been at the forefront of providing support to our economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis and it will continue to be so. But we must remember our mistakes of the past. Without credibility there can be no flexibility. And ultimately, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustainable growth and long-run prosperity is to deliver enduring price stability. That is important to remember in the face of suggestions that inflation is somehow yesterday’s battle and that the focus of monetary policy should be turned even more firmly towards growth. It should also be remembered when making difficult judgements about the likely trade-off between growth and inflation and about how far to push the MPC’s flexibility.                                                    9 This consensus is a reflection of the belief that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical. Taken literally, the suggestion that it is possible for monetary policy to stimulate increased output with little or no increase in inflation points to a near horizontal long-run Phillips curve, at least over some range of output expansion.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yves Mersch: Post-trade harmonisation and financial market integration in Europe Closing remarks by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the conference “Post-trade harmonisation and the integration of financial markets: a joint effort”, organised by the European Central Bank and the European Commission, Frankfurt am Main, 19 March 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, We have come to the end of today’s very intense programme. I now have the pleasure of sharing with you some thoughts on the main messages that have emerged in the course of today. Financial integration remains at the core of the European agenda. For the future of Europe, it is important that the Single Market project is taken forward with the full determination of all of us, even in times of difficulty. As President Mario Draghi remarked this morning, “in times of severe economic challenges, it is particularly important that our commitment to achieve a truly single European market is reaffirmed”.  From the Eurosystem’s perspective, financial integration is of great importance. First, it is vital for the single monetary policy of the euro area: monetary policy is implemented through the financial system, which has to be as efficient as possible in order to guarantee a smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy impulses. A highly integrated financial system ensures that impulses diffuse homogeneously across the whole euro area.  Second, financial integration has implications for the stability of markets. Integration results in increasing interconnections and cross-border activity. A higher level of integration will therefore be beneficial for our economy, enabling investors to find profitable investment opportunities whenever and wherever they arise. It will also enhance competition among financial intermediaries and among financial infrastructures and, as a consequence, reduce the costs of intermediation. However, highly interconnected systems could also be more prone to systemic risks. To avoid those risks, integration initiatives are being undertaken which place a very strong emphasis on the safety and resilience of financial markets and infrastructures.  Let me now turn to post-trade harmonisation, the central theme of this conference. The harmonisation of market practices, rules and standards in post-trading is a necessary component of financial integration. Inefficiencies and barriers in clearing and settlement make market access difficult for investors and for issuers. The European securities market cannot be said to be fully integrated if post-trade arrangements are not harmonised, ensuring safety, full competition and the absence of barriers across national markets.  This is why both authorities and industry players are making great efforts to achieve post-trade harmonisation. Today, we have been offered a comprehensive overview of what is currently happening in Europe at the post-trade level. On behalf of Commissioner Barnier, Mr Paulis highlighted how, with the crisis, the speed of financial reforms has accelerated. Many participants have underscored the importance of transparency to achieve safer post-trading and to increase the existing level of competition in the industry.  We have heard an interesting discussion on the legal initiatives currently being undertaken at EU level to remove the barriers that are hindering the single market objectives. MiFID is being revised to increase investor protection and improve the functioning of EU capital markets. EMIR entered into force in summer 2012, requiring standard derivative contracts to be cleared through central counterparties and establishing stringent organisational, business conduct and prudential requirements for central counterparties. The European Commission’s 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  proposal for a CSD Regulation improving securities settlement is under scrutiny by the EU legislators; it will enhance the legal and operational conditions for cross-border settlement in the Union in general, and a strong emphasis has been placed today on the importance of its timely adoption. I noted that the majority of the audience saw the need to adopt the CSD Regulation at the latest by the start of 2014, also with a view to allowing sufficient time for the technical standards. The representatives from the Parliament and the Commission have highlighted the importance and feasibility of this objective. Finally, another initiative is in the pipeline to harmonise the securities law legislation, establishing an EU-wide framework for the ownership of securities and increasing legal certainty in cross-border environments. Combined, the review of MiFID, the EMIR, the CSD Regulation and the securities law legislation are consistently building a harmonised legal framework for the whole securities transaction chain – from trading to clearing to settlement.  Important progress is also being made at the operational and business levels. The most notable example mentioned by many today is T2S, a project with huge potential for market integration. T2S will enable the participating CSDs to focus on value-added services while the basic settlement service is provided via the single T2S platform. T2S will thereby make it easier for business to move from one CSD to another. The actors that harmonise in T2S have a greater chance of reaping the full benefits of T2S and widening their business. Conversely, the European CSDs that do not harmonise may see the securities issued via their CSD being settled predominantly in another CSD participating in T2S.  An area of opportunities mentioned several times by speakers today is collateral management. Some of the regulatory initiatives I mentioned before, aiming to enhance safety in financial markets, are generating greater demand for high-quality collateral. At the same time, the crisis is making this collateral scarcer: there has been a shift from unsecured to secured funding and greater recourse to central bank liquidity. The increased demand for collateral is prompting market participants as well as the Eurosystem to develop innovative ways to make better use of existing collateral, i.e. to make assets more easily available, when and where they are needed. Harmonisation in this area is crucial to facilitate the efficient mobilisation of collateral across Europe. Examples are the auto-collateralisation functionality that will be offered by the T2S platform and the several initiatives underway to establish tri-party settlement interoperability.  It has clearly emerged from the discussion today that post-trade harmonisation is gaining momentum and achieving concrete results.  The example we heard about in more detail is the progress made on the T2S harmonisation agenda. The T2S Community and the post-trade industry have engaged in the implementation of harmonised standards and market practice in areas such as cut-off times, ISO messages, corporate actions processing, account numbering and settlement finality. As Jean-Michel Godeffroy illustrated earlier today, there is an ambitious plan in place for the coming months and a sound record of achievement so far. I noted that the audience expressed moderate optimism that the “priority one harmonisation topics” would be achieved by the launch of T2S. However, there is still a lot of work to be done in order to complete all these projects. It was very interesting in this regard to hear about the experience of Professor Giovannini, whose very name is closely associated with harmonisation and market integration. In particular, he analysed the problems faced by the Giovannini Group in the early 2000s. These reflections are very important for us now to learn from past experiences and to be able to achieve concrete results going forward.  The large participation at this conference today, with distinguished speakers and almost 250 participants from all over Europe, is testimony to the joint willingness of both the European and national institutions and market players to achieve post-trade harmonisation, and thus contribute to financial integration in Europe. Let me stress once more that the cause to which this process is contributing – the Single Market – is one of making Europe stronger 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and more attractive for national as well as cross-border investment, thus activating and sustaining growth.  To conclude, I wish to thank you all very much for your participation. Particular thanks go to all speakers and panellists for making the discussions so lively and thought-provoking. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those, from both the European Commission and the ECB, involved in preparing this very interesting conference.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Stefan Ingves: Managing structural risks in the Swedish banking sector Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at Affärsvärlden’s “Bank & Finans Outlook”, Stockholm, 20 March 2013. *      *      * Today I intend to speak about the Riksbank’s view of the structural risks in the Swedish banking sector and how they can be managed. As so often in recent years, I will take the crisis of 2007–2009, and the risk reassessments that banks, investors, researchers and decision-makers all over the world were forced to make as a result of the crisis, as my starting point. I will begin by saying a few words about the international work on regulations that arose as a consequence of the crisis. Then I will go into a little more detail about the structure and special characteristics of the Swedish banks. On the basis of this, I will present my view of the possible implications of the implementation and follow-up of the Basel III regulations for the Swedish banks. The risks associated with banking operations need to be limited First, however, I would like to give you a small example of the risks we are talking about. The US mortgage crisis became acute in 2007 and marked the start of the global financial crisis. At that time, the capital adequacy ratio, that is the amount of capital in relation to risk-weighted assets, in the major Swedish banks averaged around 7 per cent. This means that for every SEK 1 000 in risk-weighted assets, the banks funded their operations with SEK 70 of their own money and with SEK 930 in borrowed money. This is in fact a rather generous calculation and includes capital that turned out be of dubious quality.  Decisions had also been made at that time that allowed the banks to use their own internal risk models to a greater extent to calculate their capital adequacy requirements. The banks were thus able to substantially reduce the risk weights of their assets, including mortgages, in the long term. The major banks’ internal risk models indicated that the risks associated with mortgage lending were extremely low. In several cases this meant that the risk weight of a typical mortgage could easily be as low as 6 per cent, which meant that only 6 per cent of the mortgage would need to be covered. With a capital adequacy ratio of 7 per cent and a risk weight for mortgages of 6 per cent, this meant that a bank could fund each SEK 1 000 of a mortgage loan with SEK 996 in borrowed money and SEK 4 in its own money. The risk the bank itself took when it lent SEK 2 million for the purchase of a house thus corresponded to SEK 8 000 of its own capital. There were in fact transitional regulations that initially meant that the banks were not able to calculate so liberally, but these were the regulations that would apply in the longer term and thus those that the banks and investors, and often the authorities, primarily focused on. Given that the banks, in Sweden and in other countries, only needed a small amount of capital, and given that it was often assumed that they were backed by government guarantees, it was highly profitable for them to take substantial risks. The banks themselves carried only a small part of these risks, while it turned out that the banks’ customers and the taxpayers had to carry the major part. In several countries – Spain, Ireland and Denmark for example, in addition to the United States – we have seen how substantial falls in the prices of the banks' assets, mainly in the form of mortgages, have led to major economic problems.  The point is that the risk capital that the banks and their shareholders provide is limited to the value of the share capital. But society’s risks are greater than this. A mainstream assessment in economic research is that a national crisis in the financial system costs the economy around 60 per cent of GDP. In Sweden, this would be equivalent to over SEK 2 000 billion, or 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches more than SEK 200 000 per Swede. This is more than two and a half times the joint stock market value of the four major Swedish banks at the turn of the year 2012/2013.  In Sweden, we succeeded in managing the acute phase of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 in a way that made it possible to limit the costs to society. One contributing factor was probably that the crisis of the 1990s was fresh in the minds of the banks and they thus limited their risk-taking more than might otherwise have been the case, at least with regard to their operations in Sweden. As we know, not all countries were as lucky. The negative effects of the crisis are still in evidence in large parts of the world – not least in several countries in central and southern Europe – and will probably remain so for some time to come. In retrospect, it is easy to note that the combination of shortcomings in the regulations and the profit motives of the participants on the financial markets contributed to one of the worst financial crises of the modern era. The details regarding the build-up of risk and the course of the crisis have been described several times and I will not repeat them here. It is enough this time to note that banks with a limited amount of capital and banks with a high degree of market funding proved to be vulnerable when the storm broke. These insights from the crisis lie behind the regulatory work that is now underway in Sweden and abroad today. There is broad agreement that risk-taking in the banking sector must be limited and that its costs must be taken into account by the banks and their investors to a greater extent. Important steps have been taken in this direction in the global agreement on future standards for regulations in the banking sectors referred to as the Basel III Accord. The worlds’ banks will be safer when this is implemented, which will benefit everyone.  Basel III increases the safety margins in the system The Basel III regulations represent the introduction of much-needed standards that will require the banks to hold more and better capital. The minimum requirement for CET 1 capital, that is share capital and retained earnings, will be raised to 4.5 per cent of the risk-weighted assets. In addition to the minimum requirements there will be a capital-conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a buffer for systemically-important banks, which all sharpen the requirements for the level of CET 1 capital. In total, the Basel III Accord will represent a capital-adequacy requirement of 7 to 12 per cent of CET 1 capital depending on how important the bank is in a global systemic perspective and where the country's economy is in the credit cycle. This is a much higher level than previously. The countercyclical capital buffer is particularly interesting. This will be built up in good times, when credit growth is higher than normal, with the aim of creating airbags to protect the banking sector in troubled times. So far, this is the instrument on which international agreement has been reached in the field of macroprudential policy, that is a policy that comprises measures to prevent financial crises that are directed at the system as a whole. A leverage ratio requirement will also be introduced under which, irrespective of risk weights, a bank's assets may not exceed 33 times its own capital. A leverage ratio requirement represents an extra safety measure that also limits the banks’ possibilities to use internal risk models to actually keep risk weights down. Basel III also sets quantitative standards for the banks’ liquidity, a short-term (Liquidity Coverage Ratio, LCR) and a long-term (Net Stable Funding Ratio, NSFR). The short-term measure means that every bank should have sufficient liquid assets to survive for at least 30 days in a stressed scenario. The long-term measure, in principle, limits the gap between the maturity of a bank’s assets and the maturity of its liabilities.  The standards stipulated in the Basel III Accord will be implemented in national legislation during the 2010s and should be implemented in their entirety by 2019, with several interim targets along the way.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Establishing better regulations on the banks’ capital and liquidity represents a major step forward. However, in a wider perspective we can note that even in the future the worlds’ banks will have capital that only amounts to a few per cent of their assets. This is almost within the margin of error for a valuation of the total assets. The equity/assets ratio in the banking sector is only one fifth, or even one tenth, of that for companies in other sectors.  However, a central element of the Basel III Accord is that the standards are minimum regulations – countries that want to impose stricter requirements may and should do so. We have already seen cases of this – for example in the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Decisions have also been made in both the United States and the United Kingdom on more structural measures to protect the central functions of the financial sector, for example through the Dodd-Frank Act and the follow-up of the Vickers Report. In the EU, the Liikanen Report has taken up the issue of ring-fencing, that is separating the different operations of the banks from each other.  The reason is that the financial systems are different in different parts of the world. It is therefore important to design regulations that are tailored to the banking system that has to comply with them. We also need to maintain a respectable distance to the minimum regulations. Considering what we know about the Swedish banking system, there are good reasons for ensuring that Swedish banks comply with the global standards by a broad margin. The Swedish banking system is special It is thus important to put the Swedish banking system into perspective. The total domestic and foreign assets of the four major banking groups amount to 400 per cent of Sweden's GDP. In other words, out banking system is huge. Relatively speaking, it is on a par with the banking system in the United Kingdom, for example. The Swedish banking system is also highly integrated, which means that problems in one bank can easily lead to a crisis of confidence for the entire system. If we were hit by a financial crisis, the costs to society could thus be very high. With this in mind, I intend to focus in more detail on two vulnerabilities in the Swedish financial system that are interlinked. The first is the indebtedness of the Swedish households. The second is the banks’ funding in foreign currencies and their dependence on the currency-swap market.  The Swedish mortgage market has structural weaknesses An issue that has been widely discussed recently is the indebtedness of the Swedish households and the risk of a fall in housing prices. Experience in several countries has shown that indebtedness and the development of housing prices are the main explanations of why some countries are hit harder than others during economic crises. Similarly, crises that are preceded by a credit and housing boom tend to be longer and more severe than other economic crises.1 A fall in housing prices may lead households to save rather than consume in order to compensate for the fact that the value of their homes has fallen. If many households behave in this way, this may weaken economic activity, increase unemployment and create loan losses in the banks' lending to companies. This, for example, is what has happened in our neighbouring country Denmark in recent years.  What we can note is that the credit conditions for mortgages changed in the early 2000s. Interest-only mortgages became increasingly common at the same time as the loan-to-value ratios increased. The banks also began to fund mortgages by issuing so-called covered                                                  1 See Claessens, S., A, Kose, and M, Terrones (2011), “Financial Cycles: What? How? When?”, IMF Working Paper. CEPR Discussion Paper, NO.8379. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches bonds on the financial markets to an increasing extent. Easy access to inexpensive funding in combination with a high demand for mortgages led to rapid credit growth. Now, the debts of the Swedish households are high in both historical and international terms. Although the rate of credit growth has slowed down and loan-to-value ratios have fallen – the mortgage cap introduced in 2010 has probably contributed to this – there are still structural weaknesses on the Swedish mortgage market.  For instance, the mortgage survey recently published by Finansinspektionen identifies one such weakness: approximately half of all new mortgages are interest-only loans.2 This increases the scope for the households to take larger loans, which in turn increases the debt stock. Figure 1 shows household debt in relation to disposable income. It also illustrates how indebtedness in the household sector grows under different assumptions about amortisation. This raises a number of questions about the future. For example, how will the average loan-to-value ratio in the banks' mortgage stocks develop when older mortgages are paid off and new interest-only mortgages are paid out? What will the long-term consequences of a weak or non-existent amortisation culture be for peoples' private finances, the national economy and expectations of economic policy? These are questions that we are considering and that we will analyse further together with Finansinspektionen.  Figure 1 Household debt under different assumptions  regarding amortisation behaviour Percentage of disposable income  Note. The figure presents a simple illustrative calculation of how indebtedness may develop given different assumptions about the households’ amortisation behaviour in the future. The figure should not be interpreted as the Riksbank’s forecast. Sources: Statistics Sweden and the Riksbank. The banks’ extensive market funding in foreign currencies makes the system vulnerable  Another structural weakness in the Swedish banking system is that the degree of market funding is high. We can see this, for example, by looking at lending in relation to deposits. Lending is significantly higher in the Swedish banking system than in many other European                                                  2 According to Finansinspektionen’s mortgage survey 2013. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 countries (see Figure 2). This is partly because Swedes to a large extent save in funds rather than in bank accounts. Another reason is that Swedish banks retain their mortgage loans on their balance sheets, while banks in many other countries “sell” them or securitise them.  Figure 2 Lending in relation to deposits in the banking systems  of European countries Per cent  Note. Refers to monetary financial institutions Sources: The ECB and the Riksbank. Swedish banks are thus highly dependent on the capital markets to fund their lending. A large proportion, almost 45 per cent, of the funding from the capital markets is in foreign currencies. This borrowing funds assets in both Swedish kronor and foreign currencies. This dependence on market borrowing in foreign currencies gives rise to two risks. The first relates to the extent to which participants are prepared to buy the banks’ mortgage bonds and when necessary convert borrowing in foreign currencies to Swedish kronor. The second lies in the fact that the maturities for assets and liabilities in foreign currency differ. Few counterparties fund the long-term lending in Swedish kronor  The borrowing in foreign currencies also funds lending in Swedish kronor to some extent, for example for housing purposes. The Swedish banks typically fund their mortgage loans by issuing covered bonds for which the mortgages act as collateral. A large proportion of these bonds are issued in foreign currencies, mainly euro and US dollars.  The reason that the banks have chosen to get funding on the foreign markets is probably that they want to spread their sources of funding across different markets. This is also something that the credit-rating agencies encourage. It has also often proved to be an inexpensive method of funding mortgage loans. However, broadening the investor base may also mean that it consists of a larger percentage of volatile investors. Problems on the Swedish housing 0%50%100%150%200%250%300%350%
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches market may therefore lead to the banks finding it difficult to refinance their mortgage loans. We actually believe that the banks can manage rather substantial falls in the market value of housing, but if the investors' assessment is that the risk have increased they may choose not to buy the Swedish banks' bonds, despite the fact that they only entail a minor credit risk. Such concerns may also make other types of market funding more expensive and more inaccessible if the investors choose to reduce their exposures to the Swedish banking sector.  We saw examples of this in the autumn of 2008, when foreign investors wished to offload Swedish mortgage securities and the market demand for more liquid instruments, particularly Swedish government securities, increased. The Swedish National Debt Office then carried out extra issues of treasury bills and provided loans through reverse repos in covered mortgage bonds. At the same time, the Riksbank expanded its list of approved forms of collateral. All in all, this meant that in principle the government assumed the risk that lay in the outstanding stock of Swedish mortgage loans.  In order to convert borrowing in foreign currencies to lending in Swedish kronor without taking a currency risk, the banks usually conduct currency swaps. In simple terms, this is done like this: A Swedish bank borrows euros in Germany at a maturity of five years. However, as the bank does not really need the euros but needs kronor to fund mortgage loans to Swedish households, the bank has to exchange the euros for kronor. To protect itself against the currency risk, the bank enters into a currency swap in which the euros are exchanged for kronor today under an agreement to exchange the kronor back to euro at a predetermined rate in five years’ time. In this way the bank matches the currencies of its assets (the mortgages) and its liabilities and thereby eliminates the currency risk.  The Swedish banks are thus dependent on acquiring kronor in the long-term from a counterparty in a currency swap. They can in principle do this in three ways: through a foreign bank, another Swedish bank or an insurance company.  Today, it is often a foreign bank that acts as the counterparty in these swaps. The foreign banks do not themselves usually have any natural access to Swedish kronor. They therefore fund part of their lending in kronor by borrowing kronor in the short-term from other Swedish banks. However, the risk is that foreign investors will leave the Swedish market if problems arise, as the Swedish krona is a small currency. There are also reasons for believing that the number of foreign banks that act as counterparties to the Swedish banks is limited. Moreover, participating in the swap market is often not a central part of the operations of the foreign banks. This in turn has consequences for liquidity and pricing on the swap market. We saw an example of this when the last extraordinary loan that the Riksbank had offered the banks during the crisis matured in the autumn of 2010. Uncertainty then arose on the money market, and consequently swap counterparties abroad who had acquired short-term funding in kronor through Swedish banks became less willing to enter into swap agreements with Swedish banks. It thus became both more expensive and more difficult for Swedish banks to convert foreign currency into Swedish kronor at long maturities.  To a certain extent, Swedish banks also act as counterparties to each other in the swaps. However, from the perspective of the Swedish banking system this is really only a matter of redistributing the maturity risk. The fact that the banks act as counterparties to each other also forges the links within the Swedish banking system even tighter. A natural counterparty for the Swedish banks could be the Swedish life insurance and pension companies. These companies have long-term liabilities in kronor in the form of pension savings that they partly invest in assets abroad. At present, these companies are not active on the long-term currency swap markets to any great extent.  The Swedish banks are therefore dependent on a tight circle of counterparties on the currency swap markets. A small and concentrated market means in turn that there is a considerable risk of disruptions and contagion effects. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Long-term assets and short-term funding in foreign currencies create risks  Swedish banks have substantial assets in foreign currencies and also have a deposit deficit, that is they are dependent on market funding. As a large part of this market funding is short term, a liquidity risk in foreign currency also arises. The US dollar is a currency for which this risk is clear. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when the dollar market was practically closed for a while, the Riksbank needed to lend the equivalent of almost 250 billion kronor in US dollars to the banking system to prevent the liquidity risk spreading to the real economy. However, as the Riksbank cannot create liquidity in foreign currencies in the same way as it can in Swedish kronor, there are limits on the size of the liquidity risks the banks can take in foreign currencies without posing risks to financial stability. There are therefore good reasons for the banks to examine the matching of the maturities of their assets and liabilities in foreign currencies. The market for bank certificates in kronor has shrunk It is not only long-term funding that takes place in foreign currencies. A large part of the banks’ short-term funding also takes place in foreign currencies, mainly US dollars and euros. The Swedish banks are, for example, important counterparties for US money-market funds. Sweden is the second-largest European market for the money-market funds – larger than the United Kingdom or Germany. Although this indicates a high level of confidence in the Swedish banks, it also entails risks. During the crisis, we saw that the money-market funds were among the more volatile investors. A high degree of funding from the money-market funds also makes the banks dependent on US regulatory frameworks and legislative processes. For short-term funding in Swedish kronor there is a market for bank certificates. However, this market has shrunk (see Figure 3). We may wonder why this market has declined so dramatically when it seems that there should be incentives to maintain it. A thriving domestic market for bank certificates in kronor would increase the banks' scope for diversification. Their dependence on markets in foreign currencies and on the swap market would be reduced. Although these markets usually work well and Swedish banks currently have a good reputation among investors this does not always need to be the case, as we saw in 2008 and 2009.  We should of course think about how to create a liquid market for bank certificates in kronor. One problem is that the benefits of such a market fall to the banks collectively while the costs in the form of higher borrowing costs fall to each bank individually. In this perspective it may be necessary to investigate whether the costs that each individual bank pays for its short-term funding in foreign currencies reflects the true costs to the Swedish financial system and Swedish society.

Refers to certificates issued by banks, mortgage institutions and other credit institutions. Source: Statistics Sweden Swedish conditions require a complement to the reform agenda The Swedish banking system is thus marked by a number of characteristics that make it somewhat special in an international perspective – characteristics that either increase the risk of problems or the economic costs to society if problems arise in the banking sector. There are therefore good reasons for establishing a safe margin – a respectable distance – to the minimum regulations in the Basel III Accord.  As you know, we have already taken several steps to strengthen the Swedish banking system, over and above the commitments that Basel III entails. In November 2011, the Riksbank, the Ministry of Finance and Finansinspektionen announced that the four major Swedish banks would meet the capital adequacy requirements of 10 per cent of the risk-weighted assets from 1 January this year and of 12 per cent from 1 January 2015. All of the four major banks now have CET 1 ratios that are higher than 10 per cent according to the definition in Basel III. Three of the banks are also above 12 per cent. The Swedish authorities have also said that the banks should meet the short-term liquidity measure in Basel III (the LCR) both in total and separately for the euro and the US dollar. This requirement has been compulsory for the eight largest Swedish banks since 1 January this year.3 The Riksbank has also recommended the banks to improve their public information on liquidity risks and the degree of encumbered assets. This is because greater transparency increases both confidence and market discipline. I am pleased to say that the banks’ public                                                  3 These are Nordea, Swedbank, Handelsbanken, SEB, SBAB, Svensk Exportkredit, Kommuninvest and Länsförsäkringar Bank. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 reporting has improved in line with the Riksbank's recommendations, although some work still remains to be done (see Table 1).  Table 1 The banks’ public information on liquidity risks   These measures have contributed to the relative stability of the Swedish banks. But I don’t think we have finished yet. The financial system is important, and the risks in the system must be constantly reviewed. Let me give you some examples of areas that I believe will need to be investigated. As I mentioned earlier, the Swedish banks’ high dependence on market funding entails an increased risk that they will suffer liquidity problems in a stressed situation. It is of course always possible for the Riksbank to lend Swedish kronor, but it is unreasonable for the banks to take liquidity risks based on the expectation that the Riksbank will provide extraordinary loans if things do not go according to plan. The ability of the banks to comply with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio in the Basel III Accord should therefore be investigated. The differences in the maturities of the banks’ assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that I described above are also a potential source of concern in more troubling times. The Riksbank cannot after all offer unlimited liquidity in any other currency than our own. As you know, the Riksbank has therefore recently strengthened its foreign-exchange reserve so that in a situation in which the foreign-exchange market is seriously disrupted the Riksbank will be able to provide extraordinary loans in US dollars and euros. The aim of course is to strengthen the Riksbank’s preparedness to safeguard the basic workings of the financial system and thereby help us to avoid major economic costs. Given that all the Swedish banks benefit from the Riksbank’s foreign-exchange reserve, it would not be unreasonable for them to share the costs of maintaining it. If we can price this in an effective way it will also give the banks an incentive to reduce their own currency risks. This would reduce the risks to financial stability in the Swedish economy.  
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches It is of course no secret that we are also looking at mortgage loans from the asset side in the banks’ balance sheets.  As I have already pointed out, the banks’ risk weights are very low. Finansinspektionen intends to begin applying a risk-weight floor of 15 per cent for the banks’ portfolios of Swedish mortgage loans. The Riksbank supports the proposal for a risk-weight floor of 15 per cent. We also believe that there are good reasons for analysing whether this floor needs to be raised even further.  One important reason is that the public sector and non-financial companies would have to bear a large part of the risk if the debt-servicing ability of the households were to weaken.  I have also spoken about the risks arising from the fact that a large proportion of the mortgage loans are interest-only loans. In this context, the Swedish Bankers’ Association’s recommendation that all mortgages that exceed a loan-to-value ratio of 75 per cent should be amortised is of course welcome, although one may ask whether this is enough. Mortgages were amortised to a greater extent a few decades ago, at the same time as inflation automatically reduced the real debt ratio. I believe that more amortisation may be needed, especially in the current situation with low and stable inflation. However, before the authorities impose amortisation requirements it may be worth reviewing other aspects of the provision of loans. One example may be how different amortisation alternatives are presented to the borrowers. Another may be to demand that the borrowers have the financial scope to amortise their loans at a certain rate. The important thing is to restore an amortisation culture so that the households’ margins are safeguarded and the economy is protected. The Riksbank focuses on these issues because we wish to safeguard the Swedish financial system. All our analysis and all our measures aim to reduce the risk of Sweden incurring major economic costs when the banking sector gets into trouble. As a complement, Sweden also needs to put a clear framework for macroprudential policy in place. The global financial crisis demonstrated the need to complement traditional financial supervision – micro supervision – which focuses on risks in individual institutions, with supervision that focuses on the risks in the financial system as a whole. In January, the Financial Crisis Commission presented an interim report which proposed how responsibility for macroprudential policy could be allocated in Sweden. We will therefore need to consider the Riksbank's stance on this issue. A guiding principle for us is that the body that is given responsibility for macroprudential policy needs a clear mandate with both the right and obligation to take action against risks that arise and appropriate tools that can be used to limit the risks.  The discussion of macroprudential policy also comprises the issue of the Riksbank’s balance sheet, and particularly the foreign-exchange reserve. As you know, the inquiry conducted by Harry Flam recently presented its proposals. Here too, the Riksbank is in the process of formulating its stance. The public are entitled to expect that the authorities act to prevent and manage financial crises in the best possible way  All of the things I have talked about here are measures that aim to reduce the risk of a financial crisis recurring, or to limit the damage if a financial crisis nevertheless breaks out. The international process that has come to expression in the Basel III Accord is creating better regulations for the banks in all countries. This also benefits us here in Sweden.  Over and above this, however, we have to manage the Swedish banking system and its special characteristics. Sweden is a small open economy with its own currency and large banks. We need special regulations. This means that we, like a number of other countries, want to proceed more quickly and impose stricter requirements than those in the Basel III 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11 Accord. However, the measures we have taken so far have already clearly strengthened the Swedish banks. The financial sector is central in every modern society. We cannot afford recurring crises that threaten the basic functions of the financial sector. The public are entitled to expect that the authorities act to prevent and manage financial crises in the best possible way. Regulations that cover the special characteristics and structural risks of the Swedish banking sector are central instruments in the work to promote financial stability. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Guy Debelle: Some recent (and not so recent) trends in Australian debt markets Address by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the KangaNews DCM Summit 2013, Sydney, 19 March 2013. *      *      * Thanks to Christian Vallence and Tom Williams for their help. Thank you for inviting me to speak here again. Today, I’m going to talk about the local debt market. I’ll talk about the current state of play as well as a bit of history. Market Developments This time last year, debt markets globally weren’t in great shape, though the local market wasn’t faring too badly. A year on, global debt markets are in a much better position, with issuance strong across most parts of the market, spreads considerably lower and the absolute level of yields very low by historical standards. The market’s assessment of the likelihood of extreme outcomes has declined. The risks in Europe are still predominantly negative, but in China, the US and non-Japan Asia, the risks are much more balanced – one can even conceive of upside surprises! Australia’s financial markets have been influenced by these global factors. At the same time, domestic markets have benefited from strong international demand for Australian dollar assets. Local issuers continue to be viewed favourably by offshore investors looking to diversify credit exposures. Yields on Commonwealth Government securities have moved in line with global government bond yields. They are around post-federation lows, as this very long-run graph demonstrates (Graph 1). Semi-government spreads have tended to move in a fairly tight range. Yields on state government debt are also around their lowest since Federation, notwithstanding the occasional ratings downgrade. Graph 1  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Demand for CGS from offshore investors remains strong (Graph 2). The share of foreign ownership has come off its recent peak but net purchases have still continued, just not in line with the pace of issuance. There have been reports of Japanese investors selling, in large part because of the high level of the AUD/JPY exchange rate, but these sales have been more than compensated for by increased purchases by other investors.1 The foreign ownership of semis has been relatively constant, partly reflecting the preference the foreign official sector generally displays for sovereign or highly rated supranational paper rather than state or provincial debt. Instead, much of the increase in semi supply over the past couple of years has been met by the demand from domestic bank balance sheets looking to boost their liquid asset holdings. Graph 2  For financial institutions, the cost of unsecured wholesale debt has fallen sufficiently to make it economical for them to replace some of their government guaranteed securities. As we noted in a recent box in the Statement on Monetary Policy,2 banks began repurchasing this debt in large amounts towards the end of last year, and buybacks have totalled around $19 billion since the end of September (Graph 3). As a result, the contingent liability the scheme generates for the Australian Government has fallen more quickly than implied by the maturity profile of guaranteed securities, and currently stands at $53 billion.                                                 1  Some of the demand for these assets has come from the official sector. Reflecting these increased official holdings, the IMF recently announced that it will separately identify the Australian and Canadian dollars in its reserve assets report, alongside the five major reserve currencies. Given the IMF move reflects decisions already taken by reserve managers, it is unlikely that the reclassification will generate a new source of demand for Australian dollars. Nor is the IMF classification a benchmark for reserve asset allocation decisions for major reserve asset managers. Instead, the move reflects the realities that have been evident for some time. 2  See RBA (2013), “Box D: Buybacks of Government Securities”, Statement on Monetary Policy, February, pp 54–55. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Graph 3  The ability to issue covered bonds has also helped in the repurchasing of guaranteed debt, as banks can offer investors with AAA mandates an alternative asset to invest in. Covered bonds have enabled banks to diversify their investor base, and have provided issuers with a wholesale funding source less sensitive to risk events than traditional unsecured funding. After strong issuance in the beginning of 2012 as the banks ramped up their programs, covered bond issuance by Australian banks slowed as the year progressed, in large part reflecting banks’ desire to spread out the maturity profile. The major banks have utilised around 30 per cent of their issuance caps to date. Spreads on these covered bonds have tightened significantly since the first transaction in late 2011, reflecting not only the general improvement in global risk sentiment, but also increased familiarity with the product and a widening investor pool. Australian covered bonds now price at a level close to much longer established covered bond programs (Graph 4).  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Graph 4  Graph 5  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The general decline in borrowing costs in the second half of 2012 has helped entice a number of issuers back to the wholesale market, with volumes picking up across all markets towards the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2013 (Graph 5). In the unsecured market, banks continue to keep their stock of term debt relatively constant, that is, issuance is broadly in line with maturities. This strategy is the result of a number of different considerations, including the relatively subdued growth in balance sheets. But one dominant cause is the desire to maintain a strong rating, with the latent threat of a downgrade if wholesale issuance were to grow “too large”. This reflects the somewhat misplaced assessment of “deposits good, wholesale funding bad”. As a result, banks are currently paying about the same price for a 3-month term deposit as they are for a 5-year debt issue. Banks have taken advantage of the increase in risk appetite by lengthening the tenor of their issuance. The average tenor of unsecured issuance has been 5 years since the middle of last year, compared with a little over 4 years since the beginning of the financial crisis. Increasing tenor has also been a feature of other markets. For example, the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) extended the average tenor of CGS issuance in 2011/12 by over a year to 7.7 years,3 while over the past 12 months the tenor of corporate issuance has increased to nearly 11 years, compared with an average of 8 years since the beginning of the financial crisis. The securitisation market has only recently caught up to these trends, lagging behind most other segments of the debt market. Issuance has picked up of late and spreads have tightened considerably following the earlier sizeable tightening in covered bond spreads. Encouragingly, recent issuance has been completed with little or no support from the AOFM due to strong private investor demand, and primary market spreads are at their tightest level since 2007 (Graph 6). This spread tightening will lower the cost of mortgage lending for small banks and non-bank lenders who rely on securitisation for a large part of their funding.

6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Conditions have also picked up in the Kangaroo market. Ten kangaroo issuers debuted in the market in 2012. The diversity of new issuers was also a notable feature, and included Asian names and non-financial corporates. Another positive development has been the re-emergence of some non-SSA issuers not seen since the start of the global financial crisis, while more recently a number of European issuers have returned to the market after being absent for much of 2012. Kangaroo issuance has been supported by the broad-based reduction in spreads, the attractive basis, and foreign investors looking beyond AAA instruments for Australian dollar exposure. These foreign investors have been notably active and Asian investor participation in particular continues to grow. Some recent RBA initiatives in Australian debt markets I will now briefly discuss two recent RBA initiatives concerning the local debt market. Firstly, the Reserve Bank is in the process of signing two-way credit support annexes with all of its swap counterparties. A number of these agreements are already operational, including those with the Bank’s largest counterparties, and we expect agreements to be in place with all counterparties in the coming weeks. This move is in line with best practices in risk management. As more market participants collateralise their exposures in both directions, this should also free collateral for the system (in aggregate), and enhance liquidity and the resilience of the Australian derivatives markets. Secondly, late last year, the Reserve Bank announced new data reporting requirements for repo-eligible RMBS. The information required by the Bank includes loan-level and other transaction specific data that issuers must also make publicly available. These initiatives are designed to help the Bank assess the quality of RMBS provided as collateral and will also improve the transparency of the market as a whole. For investors, the data will be easier to access and because the reporting templates are standardised, investors can better compare the underlying credit characteristics of different deals, and also use the data in their own analytics. The consultation period for the proposed reporting templates closed at the end of last year. The Bank is currently reviewing the consultation findings and will finalise the reporting templates over the next month or so. A long-run perspective on Australian corporate bond issuance I will now turn to the corporate bond market. Non-financial corporate issuance has also been robust, and was particularly strong towards the end of last year, led by some large deals from the mining sector. The December quarter was the strongest on record for domestic activity, with BHP’s $1 billion transaction receiving significant interest. The deal is the largest ever non-credit wrapped transaction in the domestic market by a corporate issuer. To place these more recent trends in a longer-term context, I’d like to take a moment to consider how Australia’s corporate debt markets have evolved into their present form. The current corporate bond landscape is the result of a number of significant developments over the past century, outlined in a recent Reserve Bank Research Discussion Paper published in late 2012.4 This paper was the result of a substantial data collection exercise and extends our understanding of Australian bond issuance back to 1917. Broadly speaking, trends in bond issuance by Australian corporations can be broken down into three distinct periods (Graph 7). The first, which extended throughout the first half of the                                                 4  See Black S, J Kirkwood, A Rai and T Williams (2012), “A History of Australian Corporate Bonds”, RBA Research Discussion Paper No 2012–09. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  20th century, actually saw the peak in the size of the corporate bond market relative to GDP. This period, particularly prior to World War II, was characterised by significant issuance by government-owned Public Trading Enterprises (PTEs). Private investment, on the other hand, was largely financed through internal funds, and the modest private bond issuance that did occur was mostly to fund mining investment, much of it by corporations that later went on to become BHP. Graph 7  The bulk of the issuance by government-owned corporations took place in the 1920s. The proceeds were used mostly to fund public works programs, with investment by these PTEs accounting for as much as 7 per cent of GDP. Half of the bond issuance was by Victorian water and sanitation boards alone. Public works projects undertaken here in Sydney, on the other hand, including the building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney’s underground railway system, were mostly funded directly by governments. Over the 1930s and 1940s, the stock of corporate bonds outstanding declined as governments reallocated resources away from the PTEs to finance war-related expenditure. By the end of the Second World War, the corporate bond market had shrunk to around 18 per cent of GDP. As the economy expanded following World War II, the stock of corporate bonds remained relatively small as a share of GDP. At the same time, the corporate bond market began to shift towards a larger share of private issuance, in part to fund mining investment, and as corporations looked to source capital from outside the heavily regulated banking system (Graph 8). 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Graph 8  Graph 9  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Bond issuance trends changed significantly from the early 1980s onwards as the Australian economy and financial system underwent large structural changes. Financial deregulation and liberalisation in the late 1970s and early 1980s saw banks rely less on deposits and instead turn to the capital markets to fund balance sheet growth. As we know, bank bond issuance has since grown rapidly, and banks have become the largest issuers of Australian bonds (Graph 9). Some other notable trends since the early 1980s have included the large number of privatisations, which has resulted in the share of quasi-government bonds falling to close to zero, and the growth of the asset-backed market. On the investor side, compulsory super and increased offshore issuance caused a shift away from direct holdings by households towards indirect holdings through superannuation funds and non-resident investors. Another important development was the abolition of capital controls and the floating of the Australian dollar. Prior to the 1980s, there were a range of constraints on capital flows that were intended to prevent or discourage firms from undertaking foreign borrowing. Since these controls were relaxed, banks and other corporations have obtained a significant proportion of funding from offshore bond markets. Since 1986, the stock of bonds issued offshore by Australian residents has exceeded the size of the onshore market (Graph 10). Graph 10  The liberalisation of the capital account also contributed to the development of the “Kangaroo” bond market. Kangaroo issuance was also encouraged by, and contributed to, the development of an active cross-currency interest rate swap market in Australia. I will finish with a few thoughts on the current state of the domestic corporate bond market. There is a fair amount of discussion about the size, liquidity and functionality of the local market. Let me raise three issues worth considering: • Is the local corporate sector too banked? The US is often held up as the comparator here, but in some respects the US is the exception, with the size of the Australian corporate bond market similar to that in Europe and the UK for example. That doesn’t mean the local market shouldn’t be bigger, just that it’s not that unusual. • In many of the recent discussions about the state of the local market, I have been in the room with both issuers and investors. The issuers say there is not enough 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  demand for their paper. The investors say there is not enough supply. But what actually seems to be going on here is that the bid-ask is too wide. It is basically an issue of price. Ironically, those very same discussions are often chaired by investment banks, whose mandate, I would have thought, would be to intermediate between the issuers and the investors. • Finally, there is a nascent level of activity in developing different means of financing for sub-investment grade corporates other than traditional bank financing. Banks would still do the credit process but then potentially package a pool of sub-investment grade loans into a security that would be attractive to investors. Two of the issues around this strategy are: first, whether the margin would be attractive enough to the investor, after the bank has charged for its credit process; and second, whether the investors, particularly in the super sector, have the credit skills to appropriately assess the risk and price of such a product, given the super sector’s corporate skills have traditionally been confined to the listed corporate sector. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Karolina Ekholm: Monetary policy, business cycle stabilisation and macroprudential policy Speech by Ms Karolina Ekholm, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to a meeting at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, Stockholm, 13 March 2013. *      *      * The views expressed in this speech are my own and are not necessarily shared by the other members of the Executive Board of the Riksbank. I would like to thank Kerstin Hallsten, Kerstin af Jochnick, Cecilia Roos-Isaksson, Lars E. O. Svensson, Anders Vredin and Barbro Wickman-Parak for their comments and Magnus Wiberg for help with drafting the speech. As I am sure most of you know, I have in recent years advocated a more expansionary monetary policy than the policy that has actually been conducted. That I have done so recently, when the growth of the Swedish economy has been relatively weak, is perhaps not so surprising. On the other hand, it may be more difficult to understand the reasons for my stance in 2010, when the Swedish economy had growth rates of over 5 per cent. However, as I intend to explain today, I believe that demand has been too low in Sweden ever since the global financial crisis seriously affected the Swedish economy in the autumn of 2008. The low level of demand is ultimately the result of weak economic development around the world, which is subduing the demand for Swedish exports and making households and companies more pessimistic. In my opinion, however, this could have been counteracted by a more expansionary monetary policy. Today I intend to describe the factors that in my view indicate that aggregate demand has been too low in recent years, and to explain why, as I see it, monetary policy and fiscal policy have not been used to a greater extent to counteract low demand. My explanation is by and large that the possibility to use monetary policy and fiscal policy to stabilise aggregate demand has been limited by concerns about financial stability. Even though Sweden has coped well with the financial crisis, I believe that it has left decision-makers with the feeling that they have just had a near-death experience. Financial stability has therefore come to seem far more important that standard business cycle stabilisation. This prioritisation may well be reasonable. However, I believe that it is important to the Swedish economy that we have an effective policy for business cycle stabilisation at the same time as we conduct a policy to promote financial stability. I will discuss how this should be done towards the end of my speech. Low aggregate demand since the financial crisis When Sweden was hit by a collapse in the demand for Swedish export products at the end of 2008, GDP fell heavily. However, it did not take long for GDP to rise again and in 2010 growth figures reached almost record levels. To a certain extent, these high growth figures were of course a natural consequence of the major fall in GDP in late 2008 and early 2009. But, in contrast to many other countries, GDP in Sweden also began to exceed its pre-crisis level relatively quickly (see Figure 1). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Figure 1. GDP in Sweden and abroad Index, Q4 2007=100  Note. Seasonally-adjusted data Sources: Statistics Sweden and national sources. However, despite the relatively favourable development of GDP, it seems that unemployment has become entrenched at a high level. Initially unemployment increased less than we expected given the substantial fall in GDP – it peaked at 9 per cent in early 2010 – but since then it has fallen no lower than 7.6 per cent (see Figure 2). In my view, this is a level that is much higher than what can be considered a long-run sustainable unemployment rate.1  Figure 2. Unemployment in Sweden Per cent of labour force  Note. Seasonally-adjusted data Source: Statistics Sweden.                                                  1 Long-run sustainable unemployment rate here refers to the level of unemployment that is expected to prevail when all cyclical shocks have abated, when ongoing structural changes have had a full impact and when inflation expectations are equal to the actual rate of inflation. See for example “The long-term development of the Swedish labour market”, Monetary Policy Report, July 2012. See also “Correction of the Riksbank’s estimate of the long-run sustainable employment rate”, Appendix 2 of the minutes of the monetary policy meeting, July 2012, for a discussion of the role of expectations in the assessment of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate. 929496981001021041069294969810010210410607080910111213UKEuro areaUSASweden5678956789050607080910111213Average 1999-2012Unemployment
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Unemployment has also begun to increase again in recent months and our latest forecast predicts that it will increase further to reach 8.2 per cent in the third quarter of this year. Figure 3. CPIF inflation in Sweden Annual percentage change  Note. The series refers to monthly data.  Source: Statistics Sweden. Developments thus indicate that we have had spare capacity on the labour market since 2008. This is one of the reasons why inflation has been low in recent years. It also appears that inflation has in principle shown a downward trend since 2008. As the Riksbank’s repo-rate changes have a major impact on inflation measured in terms of the CPI, it is in this context most relevant to look at inflation measured in terms of the CPIF, that is the CPI with a fixed mortgage rate (see Figure 3). As can be seen in the figure, CPIF inflation was around 3 per cent when the Swedish economy was hit by the fall in demand at the end of 2008. It is now down to levels of around 1 per cent. The fact that Sweden has a substantial surplus on its current account, as shown in Figure 4, also indicates that domestic demand is relatively low. 01234012340506070809101112
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Figure 4. Current account as a percentage of GDP Per cent  Source: IMF WEO, October 2012. The current account reflects the difference between the value of what is produced and the value of what is absorbed in the economy through consumption and investments. It also shows the difference between total saving and total investment in the economy. The fact that Sweden has a surplus thus means that saving in Sweden is higher than the level needed to fund Swedish investments. An important reason why saving has been relatively high in Sweden since the mid-1990s is the relatively high level of financial saving in the public sector since the budget consolidation process carried out in connection with the crisis of the 1990s. Another reason is that the Swedish households also increased their saving in connection with this crisis. At the same time, the level of investment in Sweden has been relatively low compared to that in other countries (see Figure 5). This is largely due to relatively low investments in housing.2                                                  2 See for example Chapter 3 in Vredin et al.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Figure 5. Total investment as a share of GDP Per cent  Note. Average value 2001–2007 and 2008–2010. Source: IMF WEO, October 2012. The current account surplus has in fact decreased somewhat in recent years. It was approximately 9 per cent of GDP in 2008 and approximately 7 per cent of GDP in 2011. However, it is still high in historical terms and in comparison with other countries. It is hard to see that there are any major advantages for the Swedish households of a significant part of their incomes being used to fund investments abroad, which in reality is what this means. To me, this is another sign that demand is too low in Sweden. Low demand is restraining consumption so that saving is high, and is also restraining investment. My interpretation of developments regarding the labour market, inflation and the current account is thus that demand in the Swedish economy has been far too low since Sweden was hit by the fall in demand in the autumn of 2008. Although both monetary policy and fiscal policy have been used to counteract the fall in demand, this has not compensated in full for weak economic development abroad and for the weakening optimism of the households and companies.  The fact that unemployment was relatively high in Sweden already prior to the financial crisis (as can be seen in Figure 2, unemployment has averaged just over 7 per cent since 1999) and that the current account surplus has been substantial since the second half of the 1990s, raises the question of whether aggregate demand has been weak in an even longer perspective. My colleague Lars E. O. Svensson has, for example, claimed that unemployment has been unnecessarily high since the mid-1990s because monetary policy has not been used to a sufficient extent to counteract shocks that have pushed down inflation.3 It is of course important to determine what the situation was with regard to resource utilisation before the financial crisis in order to be able to assess the level that unemployment should eventually fall to. But this is not the issue that I intend to focus on today: my focus                                                  3 See the paper “The possible unemployment cost of average inflation below a credible target” or the speech “Monetary policy and inflation: monetary policy is too tight”, 16 January 2013. 0510152025300510152025302001-20072008-2011
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches here is instead on the issue of how economic policy could be used more effectively to stabilise business cycle fluctuations in the future despite the risks to financial stability.    Limited stimulation from fiscal policy In contrast to the situation in many European countries and the United States, there was a significant surplus in public net lending in Sweden when the financial crisis began. In the euro area and the United States, public net lending as a percentage of GDP had shown an average deficit of just under 2 per cent during the 10 years before the crisis. The corresponding figure for Sweden was a surplus of over 1 per cent; in line with the so-called surplus target.4 The much stronger state of public finances than in many other countries was largely a consequence of the fiscal policy framework that has gradually been developed since the 1990s.5 This put Sweden in a much better initial position in terms of its public finances when the financial crisis began. Fiscal policy contributes to stabilising business cycle fluctuations without any specific decisions being made through the so-called automatic stabilisers; that is through the fact that tax revenues fall and expenditure for various grants and benefits increases automatically when economic activity declines and unemployment increases.6 However, in addition to this, active decisions can also be made that affect revenues and expenditure. Despite the severe downturn in 2008–2009, public net lending in Sweden fell to only –1 per cent of GDP in 2009. This is much less than in the euro area, the United Kingdom and the United States (see Figure 6). Public indebtedness has increased substantially in the United States and in many European countries in recent years, partly as a result of the automatic stabilisers and partly as result of government intervention in the financial sector to deal with systemically-important banks that have experienced problems. In these countries, the scope to influence the economy using fiscal-policy stimulation measures is therefore very limited today. The countries that have the weakest public finances in Europe are forced to implement tightening measures despite the weak state of their economies because the high level of debt is creating uncertainty about the ability of the countries to repay further loans. In Sweden, on the other hand, there is scope for active fiscal-policy stimulation measures if they were needed.                                                  4 OECD Economic Outlook, November 2012; IMF WEO, October 2012. The surplus target is that public sector net lending should average one per cent of GDP over an economic cycle. 5 The fiscal-policy framework comprises a budget-policy framework, principles for stabilisation policy, principles for government intervention on the financial markets and principles for openness and transparency. In turn, the budget-policy framework comprises a surplus target for the public sector as a whole, an expenditure ceiling for the central government, and demands that the local-government sector should exercise sound financial management and have balanced budgets and a strict budget process. 6 Automatic stabilisers consist of the effects that arise when tax revenues and various grants and benefits adapt to the economic cycle without active decisions being made.

It is important in this context to remember that the primary aim of the fiscal-policy framework that we have in Sweden is to make public finances sustainable in the long term. Prior to the financial crisis, the greatest threat to the long-term sustainability of public finances appeared to be an ageing population.7 An ageing population increases the demands on the public sector at the same time as the extent to which the sector can be funded by taxes on employment income decreases. However, the experience gained in countries where the need to rescue systemically-important banks has exerted great pressure on public finances has given us a somewhat different perspective. In a country like Sweden, which has a large banking system in relation to the size of the economy, a banking crisis could quickly have a devastating effect on public finances. Given this, the risk of a financial crisis is therefore perhaps the greatest potential risk to the long-term sustainability of public finances. The need to save for a rainy day also probably appears to be greater as it is much easier to manage a financial crisis if public finances are strong from the outset. It is for this reason that I believe that the willingness to use fiscal policy to stimulate demand in the economy is limited by concerns about financial stability. At present, therefore, we should probably not expect fiscal policy to contribute much more than the effects of the automatic stabilisers when it comes to stimulating the Swedish economy. The Riksbank’s forecast is that public net lending will be negative at –1.1 per cent of GDP this year. However, it is expected to gradually increase to 0.3 per cent of GDP in 2015 as economic activity improves. The fact that fiscal policy is not contributing more actively to stimulate demand in the economy is, however, completely in line with the established procedure for stabilisation                                                  7 See, for example, the calculations of the National Institute of Economic Research: “A Longer Term View of General Government Finances - Developments Will Require More Hours Worked”, The Swedish Economy, December 2005. -14-12-10-8-6-4-2024-14-12-10-8-6-4-202499000102030405060708091011UKEuro areaUSASweden
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches policy in Sweden as I perceive it. In my view, the main responsibility for active business cycle stabilisation has lain with monetary policy since the crisis of the 1990s.8 However, this view is based on a flexible interpretation of our inflation target in the sense that the target comprises a stabilisation of the development of the real economy.9 Too little stimulation from monetary policy Monetary policy also became much more expansionary when demand in the Swedish economy fell rapidly in late 2008 and early 2009. Between October 2008 and July 2009, the repo rate was cut by a total of 4.5 percentage points to the record-low level of 0.25 per cent, and it remained at this level for a year (see Figure 7). Figure 7. Policy rates in Sweden, the euro area, the United States  and the United Kingdom Per cent  Sources: The Riksbank and national sources. However, the Riksbank began to raise the repo rate in July 2010 and in July 2011 it was at 2.0 per cent. Since then, the repo rate has been cut again in a number of steps to 1.0 per cent as the weak development in the euro area has had a negative impact on the Swedish economy. As can be seen in Figure 7, policy rates in the United States and the United Kingdom have remained close to zero throughout this period. The ECB began to raise the policy rate in the euro area in 2011, but quickly had to begin cutting it again.                                                  8 The spring budget bill for 2008 describes situations in which discretionary fiscal policy is justified as “crisis situations or in connection with supply shocks where fiscal policy may need to support monetary policy”. The Swedish Fiscal Policy Council interprets this to mean that, in the government’s view, the Riksbank has the main responsibility for business cycle stabilisation. See Chapter 1 of the 2011 report of the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council, “Swedish Fiscal Policy”. 9 The publication “Monetary Policy in Sweden” describes the Riksbank’s flexible inflation targeting regime (Sveriges Riksbank 2010). 0123456012345607080910111213UKEuro areaUSASweden
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 Many central banks have also conducted so-called unconventional monetary policy by purchasing assets or providing liquidity at longer maturities than normal in other ways.10 All in all, this has led to a more expansionary monetary policy in large parts of the rest of the world than in Sweden, despite the fact that the repo rate is at an historically low level. The fact the Swedish monetary policy has been less expansionary than in many other countries may seem reasonable considering that the Swedish economy has also performed much better than that of many other countries. This is particularly true in comparison with other European countries, as shown in Figure 1. But, it is a problem that monetary policy has not been expansionary enough to keep inflation at a rate of around 2 per cent and to bring unemployment down to a long-run sustainable rate. 11  Why hasn’t monetary policy been expansionary enough? One reason is that to a certain extent we overestimated the strength and duration of the temporary recovery in the Swedish economy in 2010 and therefore also overestimated inflationary pressures. Another reason is the fear that a more expansionary monetary policy would increase the risks associated with household indebtedness. Here, it is once again the events in other countries during the financial crisis that have given rise to such fears. In several countries with a high level of household indebtedness and high housing prices, substantial falls in housing prices have led to a fall in consumption demand, which in turn has weakened the development of the real economy. In some areas, this has also led to higher loan losses and risks to financial stability. Risks associated with household indebtedness Personally, however, I do not believe that the risks associated with household indebtedness have represented a weighty argument against conducting a more expansionary monetary policy recently. There is of course every reason to avoid a situation in which housing prices fall dramatically. However, I find it difficult to see that current developments regarding housing prices and loans to households in Sweden are such that they justify further measures. Housing prices and the households’ debts as a percentage of their disposable incomes rose substantially in Sweden from the mid-1990s until the start of the financial crisis. As can be seen in Figure 8, real housing prices also increased dramatically in the other Nordic countries in this period. However, the situation has been different in recent years. The rate of growth in loans to households has fallen significantly and the debt ratio has therefore levelled out, although at an historically high level (see Figure 9). Increases in housing prices have also been much more subdued in recent years. As in Finland, real housing prices seem to                                                  10 In the United States, the central bank has added liquidity to the markets by purchasing bonds. The central banks in the United Kingdom and Japan have also launched extensive asset-purchase programmes. The ECB has offered loans to European banks in the form of three-year LTRO loans (Long-term Refinancing Operations). The ECB has also announced a new support programme, Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) which enables unlimited purchases of government bonds in countries that apply for emergency loans and thus accept the conditions for such loans. 11 In the Monetary Policy Report published in July 2012, the Riksbank’s assessment was that the long-run sustainable unemployment rate is in the interval 5–7.5 per cent. The mid-point of the estimated interval is thus 6.25 per cent. There are also other estimates of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate. In the latest issue of its report “Wage Formation in Sweden”, the National Institute of Economic Research assesses this rate to be around 7 per cent at present, but that it will fall to around 6 per cent in the years immediately ahead (see Wage Formation in Sweden 2012, National Institute of Economic Research). According to a calculation by Lars Svensson of how the deviation between the actual inflation rate and the inflation target affects unemployment, the mid-point of the Riksbank’s estimated interval is at 5.5 per cent (see “Correction of the Riksbank’s estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate”, Appendix 2, minutes of the monetary policy meeting, July 2012).

BIS central bankers’ speeches 11 Developments on the Swedish housing market thus appear to be much calmer now than before the financial crisis. However, it is of course important to constantly analyse whether developments can pose risks to financial or macroeconomic stability. The development of household indebtedness could lead to problems if housing prices began to fall for some reason or if unemployment began to increase sharply in connection with a downturn. In order to assess to what extent this constitutes a risk we need to analyse the risk of a fall in housing prices and the extent to which the level of debt makes the households vulnerable. In the case of the latter, it is important to determine what assets the households have in addition to their housing. The relatively high level of private saving in Sweden is an advantage here as it has led to a situation in which the households have relatively substantial financial assets (see Figure 9).  Analysing the risk of a fall in housing prices is not easy, but a natural starting point is to try to find good indicators of such price falls based on the experience gained in other countries. According to a study by the IMF, the likelihood of a fall in housing prices increases if the growth of loans as a percentage of GDP is high, the current account is in deficit and housing investments are high in relation to GDP.12 Put simply, one can say that the risk of a fall in housing prices is high in economies where there is a loan-financed building boom and where the loans are largely backed by funding abroad rather than by domestic saving. Credit growth has indeed been relatively high in Sweden for a number of years, so on the basis of just this indicator there is some reason to believe that there is an increased risk of a fall in housing prices. However, the situation with regard to the current account and housing investment has rather been the opposite of that associated with an increased risk of such price falls. As I mentioned earlier, Sweden has a substantial surplus on its current account and this has now been the case for many years. Figure 4 also illustrated developments in a number of countries where housing prices have fallen, such as Ireland, Spain and the United States, and we can see that the current account deficits have been relatively substantial in all of these countries. One explanation of the relatively low level of overall investment in Sweden, which is one of the factors behind the current account surplus, is in fact the low level of investment in housing (see Figure 10). There are thus no signs that the credit growth we have experienced has financed a building boom or that it is associated with a low level of domestic saving. In recent years, the number of new-builds in the housing sector in Sweden has been around 20 000 per year, which a low figure in historical terms.13 The low level of new housing construction is thus an important factor behind rising house prices.14                                                  12 When all of these three factors deviated significantly from their normal patterns at the same time, there was a 56 per cent probability of a substantial fall in housing prices. See IMF (2009), World Economic Outlook, October. 13 This is a level that over the last 50 years has only been lower for a few years during the 1990s (Statistics Sweden, 2012 “Housing construction low for a long time”, SCB Economic Indicator, no. 2012:92). 14 Peter Englund, among others, points to the low level of housing construction in Sweden as one of the reasons for the sharp increase in prices; see Englund, Peter (2011), “Swedish house prices in an international perspective”, Chapter I.1 in The Riksbank’s inquiry into risks in the Swedish housing market.

Simple rules, difficult times – does stabilisation policy need to be changed?  Other indicators of falls in housing prices have also been proposed, for example the positive deviation of housing prices from a long-term trend, which at present is relatively high in Sweden.15 However, the point is that the picture provided by the typical indicators of a fall in housing prices is mixed for Sweden. Some appear to be alarming while others are practically the opposite of what is typically the case before a fall in housing prices. This does not of course mean that we can be certain that prices will not fall, but it is still important to have this background clear in order to be able to assess the risks on the housing market. If developments in the period ahead are such that it seems justified to take measures to dampen housing prices and household indebtedness, I am nevertheless doubtful about using the repo rate to do this. It would be better to reduce the level of the loan-to-value ceiling that Finansinspektionen recommends the banks to stay below, or to raise the banks’ risk weights for mortgages.16 Another alternative would be to reduce the tax deductions for interest payments somewhat. Unlike repo-rate increases, these measures are aimed directly at mortgages. These are of course measures that do not lie within the Riksbank’s mandate, but it is in everyone’s interest to ensure that the risks associated with the Swedish housing market are managed effectively. So why am I against using the repo rate to influence housing prices and household indebtedness? The main reason is that the costs – in the form of inflation below the target                                                  15 For example, Borio and Drehmann (2009) present an indicator of financial crisis based on trend deviations for private loans as a percentage of GDP and property prices in the paper “Assessing the risk of banking crises – revisited”. The latter components are intended to capture the likelihood and magnitude of a fall in property prices. 16 Finansinspektionen has recently proposed a floor of 15 per cent for risk weights for mortgages. This floor could be raised if there seems to be a need to dampen the banks’ lending for housing purposes. 0246810120246810122001-20072008-2010
BIS central bankers’ speeches 13 and unemployment – appear to be high in relation to rather uncertain gains. Most analyses indicate that the policy rate has very little impact on housing prices and thus also on household indebtedness.17 Using the repo rate would be justified if what we were seeing was a credit boom throughout the Swedish economy. But this is not what we are seeing. Household indebtedness is increasing at approximately the same rate as disposable incomes. The rate of growth in bank lending to companies typically varies with the business cycle, and at present this rate is low (see Figure 11). All in all, credit growth is relatively low in the Swedish economy.  Figure 11. Lending to households and companies  from monetary financial institutions Annual percentage change  Source: The Riksbank. Another problem with using monetary policy to influence household indebtedness is that this also has an impact on the exchange rate. All else being equal, higher interest rates lead to a stronger currency and, again all else being equal, a stronger currency leads to lower inflation and lower resource utilisation. There are thus clear costs associated with using monetary policy in this way. The alternative – and a better one – is to separate monetary policy from the policy that aims to promote financial stability. This could be done by establishing an effective framework for macroprudential policy that is a policy that aims to counteract risks in the financial system as a whole.                                                  17 See for example Kuttner, Kenneth (2012), “Low Interest Rates and Housing Bubbles: Still No Smoking Gun”, under publication in The Role of Central Banks in Financial Stability: How Has it Changed?, and Claussen, Carl Andreas, Magnus Jonsson and Björn Lagerwall (2011), “A macroeconomic analysis of housing prices in Sweden”, Chapter II.1 in The Riksbank’s inquiry into risks in the Swedish housing market. -10-505101520-10-5051015200304050607080910111213Total lending from monetary financial institutionsCompaniesHouseholds
14 BIS central bankers’ speeches A separate macroprudential policy In January 2013, the Financial Crisis Commission presented an interim report that discusses, among other things, how financial crises can be prevented in Sweden. The Commission proposes the setting up of a council for macroprudential policy. This would entail the existing council for cooperation on macroprudential policy between the Riksbank and Finansinspektionen being established by law and complemented by independent experts and an observer from the Ministry of Finance. The council should also work to develop macroprudential policy instruments, analyse risks and discuss appropriate measures. The intention is that responsibility for deciding whether or not to apply a macroprudential policy instrument would lie with either Finansinspektionen or the Riksbank. The Commission’s proposal is well-reasoned and wise, but, as I see it, has one flaw: it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for conducting macroprudential policy. As it will usually be a question of taking measures that are unpopular – for example limiting the possibilities of households to borrow money in a way that will restrict their choices about where they can live, or limiting the possibilities of financial companies to earn money – it is vital that someone is made responsible for ensuring that the measures are actually taken. This may well be, as the Commission suggests, the Riksbank or Finansinspektionen. However, I am sceptical about both authorities being responsible, as it will be all too easy to blame each other when a crisis actually develops.18  It is of course natural for the Riksbank to play a central role in macroprudential policy, as financial stability is a precondition for macroeconomic stability and risks to financial stability are therefore analysed on an ongoing basis.19 However, a responsibility for macroprudential policy may potentially come into conflict with the independence the Riksbank has in the field of monetary policy. This is an independence based on the realisation that a politically-governed monetary policy tends to be inflationary, as it may be tempting for political reasons to renege on a promise of low inflation and to conduct a more inflationary monetary policy that reduces unemployment in the short-term.20 However, independence goes hand in hand with a clearly-defined objective for monetary policy that can be constantly evaluated. Macroprudential policy is different in nature, as the objective is to prevent crises. It is of course possible to constantly register whether a crisis has occurred or not, but if a crisis has not occurred it is difficult to determine whether the measures taken have been well-designed or not. As it is a case of unpopular measures, one might think that it would be an advantage if the decisions were made by people who in practice cannot be dismissed. But this this may not be a particularly good solution from a democratic point of view. At the same time, macroprudential policy may address the issue of macroeconomic stability in such a way that it comes close to what monetary policy aims to achieve. The historically-high level of household indebtedness in Sweden does not perhaps in the first instance pose a risk of financial crisis but to macroeconomic development in the longer term. A fall in housing prices in connection with an economic slowdown with increased unemployment could lead to a severe downturn if the households reacted by significantly increasing their saving to compensate for declining wealth.21 This risk relates to financial and macroeconomic                                                  18 Similar criticism was expressed by my colleague Kerstin af Jochnick in the speech “Monetary policy and macroprudential policy”, 25 January 2013. 19 The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) highlights the role of the central bank in its recommendations on institutional frameworks for national macroprudential policy (see the Recommendation of the European Systemic Risk Board of 22 December 2011 on the macroprudential mandate of national authorities). 20 See for example Kydland, Finn and Edward Prescott (1977), “Rules rather than discretion: The inconsistency of optimal plans”, Journal of Political Economy, vol. 85, pp. 473–490. 21 The February Monetary Policy Report discusses the macroeconomic consequences of a fall in housing prices in the article “The household balance sheet and the macroeconomic assessment”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 15 imbalances rather than to financial stability. They are also imbalances that must be viewed in a much longer perspective than the perspective we usually adopt when we make decisions about the repo rate. Financial and macroeconomic imbalances of this type can of course result in financial crises, but do not do so automatically. We should therefore distinguish between avoiding such imbalances and avoiding crises than threaten the financial system. In both cases I believe that we need an active policy alongside the standard stabilisation policy. I am sure that everyone agrees that the Riksbank has a central role to play in analysing the emergence of financial and macroeconomic imbalances. However, what the role of the Riksbank should be when it comes to deciding on measures to counteract imbalances in the longer term is a more open question at present. In my view, it is important that macroprudential policy is put in place as a separate policy area. This would be good for financial stability, but also good for macroeconomic stabilisation. The proposal of the Financial Crisis Commission has now been circulated for comment and I and the other members of the Executive Board of the Riksbank will now formulate our joint response to the proposal during the spring. Conclusions I thus believe that there are many indications that demand is too weak in the Swedish economy and that in principle this has been the case ever since the autumn of 2008. One should not have exaggerated expectations of what monetary policy can achieve when it comes to reducing the relatively high level of unemployment in Sweden. However, as long as inflation is expected to be clearly under the target of 2 per cent I believe there is scope to use monetary policy to try to alleviate the situation on the labour market. I have argued that one of the reasons why fiscal policy and monetary policy have not been used more actively to increase demand in the Swedish economy is the concern about financial stability. The risk that public finances will be radically weakened if the government is forced to intervene to support banks in crisis seems to be an argument for being cautious with public finances at present. The risk that low interest rates will increase household indebtedness and that this in turn will increase the vulnerability of the households if, for example, housing prices fall for some reason has been put forward as an argument against lowering the repo rate.22 Personally, I do not believe that the latter risk is particularly serious at present as the rate of increase in lending to households has declined significantly since before the financial crisis. Nevertheless, it is a risk that is taken into account in the monetary policy decisions. All in all, therefore, economic policy has not sufficiently counteracted the effects of weak development abroad and pessimistic households and companies. How can we establish an effective policy for business cycle stabilisation in Sweden without at the same time exposing the economy to considerable risks with regard to financial stability? One important step is to establish a separate policy area with explicit responsibility for preventing financial crises. If we succeed in creating an effective framework for such a policy area, monetary policy would be better able to focus on its main tasks: stabilising inflation around the inflation target and resource utilisation around a sustainable level. The interim report of the Financial Crisis Commission, with its proposal to set up a council for macroprudential policy, is welcome in this context. However, as I have pointed out earlier, the division of responsibility is not set out very clearly in this proposal and it is unclear which authority should do what. For me it is not important that it is the Riksbank, rather than any other authority, that is given the responsibility and the instruments to conduct                                                  22 See, for example, Apel, Mikael and Carl-Andreas Claussen (2012), “Monetary policy, interest rates and risk taking”, Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review 2012:2, pp. 66–80, for an outline of the relationship between low interest rates, increased credit expansion and the boom on the property market in many countries that to a large extent lay at the centre of the crisis. 
16 BIS central bankers’ speeches macroprudential policy. But it is important that someone is given responsibility, otherwise we will have created a framework that is no clearer than the one we have today. Exactly how responsibility should be allocated is an issue that I am not prepared to discuss further today. It is an issue that will have to wait until the Riksbank submits its response to the interim report of the Financial Crisis Commission later in the spring.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yoshihisa Morimoto: Economic activity and prices in Japan and monetary policy Speech by Mr Yoshihisa Morimoto, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Kochi, 20 February 2013. *      *      * I. Recent financial and economic developments A. Overseas developments 1. Global financial markets I would like to start with developments in global financial markets and overseas economies, which affect Japan’s economy. Against the backdrop of the European debt problem, some nervousness continued to be seen in global financial markets through summer 2012, but the tail risk of a potential disintegration of the euro, which some had feared at one time, has receded since the autumn. This is because gradual progress has been made in discussions and measures for further strengthening and restructuring the euro area to form an economic and financial union with greater stability. Steps include (1) the introduction of the modalities for undertaking Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) by the European Central Bank (ECB), which have created a safety valve in government bond markets, especially in peripheral countries such as Spain and Italy; and (2) an agreement to establish a single banking supervisory mechanism in Europe to ensure the stability of the European financial system. More recently, it emerged that the amount of early repayments under the ECB’s 36-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), implemented in early 2012 in response to the crisis, turned out to be larger than markets expected, suggesting that the financial system is regaining stability. Meanwhile, in the United States the “fiscal cliff” has been avoided and investors’ risk aversion has been abating. Nevertheless, as these factors contain numerous inherent uncertainties, market developments require continued attention. 2. Overseas economies Under these circumstances, the extent of deceleration in many overseas economies became more pronounced through summer 2012 due in part to the anxiety in global financial markets reflecting concern over the European debt problem. Overseas economies remained in a deceleration phase thereafter, but at present, while the euro area economy remains stagnant, the U.S. and Chinese economies show some positive developments. As for the outlook, assuming that global financial markets remain stable on the whole, overseas economies are expected to gradually emerge from the deceleration phase and turn to a moderate recovery. 3. Euro area economy By region, economic activity in the euro area has been receding slowly. Given the continued adverse feedback loop in peripheral countries among the fiscal situation, the financial system, and economic activity, business and household sentiment has become cautious. Because fiscal austerity measures will continue, economic activity is expected to continue receding slowly for the time being. However, while tensions in financial markets have been easing, business sentiment has shown signs of improvement in core countries such as Germany. Regarding the outlook, as economies outside the euro area pick up, economic activity in the euro area – particularly in the core countries – is likely to gradually emerge from the deceleration phase, led by exports. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  4. U.S. economy The U.S. economy continued to recover at a moderate pace, particularly in the household sector, supported by accommodative financial conditions. Although some weakness can be seen in household sentiment due to the effects of the expiration of the payroll tax cut at the beginning of 2013, the employment situation has been improving, albeit modestly, and private consumption has been firm, as evidenced by continued brisk car sales. Housing-related investment has also continued to show signs of picking up, albeit at a depressed level. Because the fiscal cliff was avoided, reducing the risk of a sharp fiscal tightening, business sentiment has been improving, and consequently, the deceleration in business fixed investment is coming to a halt. The U.S. economy is likely to continue recovering, supported by accommodative financial conditions. Nevertheless, the pace of recovery is likely to remain only moderate for the time being, reflecting the lack of momentum in external demand as well as continued downward pressure from the fiscal side. 5. China’s economy, and the NIEs and the ASEAN economies With regard to emerging countries, the Chinese economy has been regaining stability on the back of firm domestic demand. Domestic demand as a whole has been firm, as evidenced by the uptrend in infrastructure investment and retail sales. There are also signs of a bottoming out in exports and imports. Reflecting these developments in demand at home and abroad, industrial production has also been stabilizing. As for the outlook, domestic demand is expected to remain firm, partly due to the effects of policies taken since mid-2012 such as monetary easing and the front-loading of public works projects. Under these circumstances, as inventory adjustments make progress and exports gradually pick up, the recovery of the Chinese economy is likely to become more pronounced. However, since China’s new administration has launched a policy emphasizing “quality-based” growth and targeting well-balanced growth, the pace of economic growth in China is expected to be restrained relative to the high growth in the mid-2000s. The NIEs and the ASEAN economies are picking up only moderately, led by the corporate sector, but are expected to gradually regain momentum underpinned by firm private consumption. B. Japan’s economy and prices 1. Economic activity I will now explain the current state of, and outlook for, Japan’s economy given the overseas economic developments I have just outlined. Japan’s economy picked up rapidly following the plunge caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, which struck just as the economy was recovering from the Lehman shock, and it posted relatively high growth in the first half of 2012. In the second half of 2012, however, the economy as a whole was relatively weak as exports and industrial production dropped sharply due to the effects of the deceleration in overseas economies. However, this downward momentum has recently been coming to an end. Specifically, the pace of decrease in exports has been moderating in a situation where some signs of picking up have been observed in overseas economies, particularly in the United States and China. In addition, private consumption has been resilient, and the effects of the decline in car sales due to the ending of subsidies for purchasers of environmentally friendly cars have fallen off. Meanwhile, public investment has continued to increase, and housing investment has generally been picking up. With regard to the outlook, as the effects of various economic measures underpin domestic demand and overseas economies emerge from the deceleration phase, exports and industrial production are likely to start picking up, and these improvements are likely to feed through into business fixed investment and private consumption. In addition, recent movements in foreign exchange rates are likely to contribute to the underpinning of exports and corporate profits. Under these circumstances, Japan’s economy is likely to more or less level off for the time being and subsequently return to a moderate recovery path toward mid-year. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The economic growth rate in fiscal 2013 is expected to be relatively high, mainly owing to the effects of various economic measures and foreign exchange rate movements. Although the economic growth rate is likely to decrease mainly due to a decline in demand following the front-loading of consumption prior to the consumption tax hike, growth is expected to remain above potential in fiscal 2014. In the Bank of Japan’s interim assessment in January 2013, the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts for Japan’s real GDP growth rate is 2.3 percent for fiscal 2013 and 0.8 percent for fiscal 2014. 2. Prices Next, I will talk about price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food is around 0 percent. For the time being, it is expected to turn negative due to the reversal of the previous year’s rise in energy prices and of the movements in durable consumer goods, and thereafter, it is likely to be around 0 percent again. However, in the somewhat longer term, the rate of change is likely to turn positive as the aggregate supply and demand balance improves due to the recovery of Japan’s economy, and is expected to gradually rise in fiscal 2014. In the Bank’s interim assessment in January 2013, the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts for the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food; excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike) is 0.4 percent for fiscal 2013 and 0.9 percent for fiscal 2014. C. Uncertainty surrounding the outlook The baseline scenario for Japan’s economy described thus far is subject to both upside and downside risks. Risk factors that particularly warrant close attention are developments in overseas economies and uncertainty with regard to firms’ and households’ medium- to long-term growth expectations. With regard to overseas economies, remaining uncertainty over the European debt problem and future developments in the relations between Japan and China require due attention. As for the Chinese economy, whether it will succeed in making a smooth transition to stable growth is a key issue. The economy is likely to face various structural changes, including in labor supply and demand conditions following the reduction of excess capacity in the manufacturing sector and surplus labor in rural areas, as well as in the supply and demand conditions for resources. Attention therefore needs to be paid to the risk that these changes will impose constraints on the Chinese economy. On the other hand, the so-called shale revolution in the United States may buoy up the U.S. economy through declines in energy and materials prices. With regard to the Japanese economy, various economic measures will likely boost its growth rate for the time being; in the meantime, however, there is uncertainty over the extent to which the economic measures can promote a virtuous circle in which firms’ and households’ medium- to long-term growth expectations rise as a result of progress in regulatory reforms. As for prices, attention needs to be paid to the possibility that materialization of the aforementioned risks to economic activity could exert considerable effects on developments in prices, including the supply and demand balance. II. Monetary policy under the “price stability target” Next, I would like to turn to the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy under the current economic and price situation. In order for Japan’s economy to overcome deflation as early as possible and return to a sustainable growth with price stability, the Bank has been pursuing aggressive monetary easing. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 21 and 22, 2013, the Bank took decisive additional steps to provide monetary accommodation. Specifically, the Bank decided to introduce (1) the “price stability target” in place of the “price stability goal in the medium to long term”, and (2) the “open-ended asset purchasing method” under the Asset Purchase Program. Furthermore, the Bank released “Joint Statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan on Overcoming Deflation and Achieving Sustainable Economic Growth” with the 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  government. In addition, by providing strong support to lending by financial institutions, the Bank is making efforts to ensure that firms and households make use of the accommodative financial conditions. In what follows, I will explain the aim of, and thinking behind, the Bank’s policy measures. A. Introduction of the “Price Stability Target” of 2 percent 1. What is “price stability”? I would now like to explain the details of the “price stability target”. The Bank conducts monetary policy based on the principle that monetary policy shall be aimed at “achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy”. On this basis, I would like to explain the price developments under which the Bank perceives “price stability” and the reasons for setting the target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. “Price stability” is defined conceptually as a state where various economic agents may make decisions regarding such economic activities as consumption and investments without being concerned about the fluctuations in the general price level, and this must be achieved on a sustainable basis. The Bank considers “price stability” to be a situation in which the economy improves in a balanced and sustainable manner, accompanied by increases in employment, wages, and corporate profits, and prices rise moderately as a result. To put it simply, what the Bank is aiming to achieve with the “price stability target” is to create an environment in which corporate profits and wages rise in a sustainable manner that primarily reflects increases in productivity. For example, when import prices rise, this may push up the inflation rate, but such an increase in inflation is not accompanied by an improvement in the economy because the terms of trade will deteriorate and real income of households and firms will fall. This is not the type of inflation the Bank aims to achieve. In Japan, given that inflation has been hovering at a low level of close to 0 percent year on year for a prolonged period, low inflation expectations have become entrenched in firms’ and households’ decision making. Given this, the “price stability target” of 2 percent may be seen as somewhat high. However, as I explained earlier, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is projected to move closer to 1 percent through fiscal 2014 supported by a recovery in the economy. If, in this situation, efforts by a wide range of entities to raise the competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy bear fruit and firms’ and households’ inflation expectations rise as a result, the inflation rate consistent with price stability on sustainable basis will rise as well after fiscal 2014. The Bank will continue to provide support from the financial side through measures to pursue aggressive monetary easing and support strengthening the foundations for economic growth in order to underpin the signs of recovery currently seen. The Bank will do its utmost so that the CPI will rise steadily to the target of 2 percent and that the target will be achieved at the earliest possible time. 2. Inflation mechanism Now, I would like to briefly explain the mechanism through which the inflation rate rises. From a somewhat long-term perspective, there is a mild positive correlation between the rate of increase in the CPI and the aggregate supply and demand balance. If, as a result of an improvement in the economy, aggregate demand in the economy as a whole increases relative to production capacity and, therefore, the balance between aggregate supply and demand improves, the rate of increase in the CPI will rise with a time lag of several quarters. Since the mid-1990s, Japan’s economy has tended to face a shortage of aggregate demand and the rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been on a moderate declining trend since the latter half of the 1990s, with the exception of 2007 and 2008. The aggregate supply and demand balance reached nearly minus 8 percent after the Lehman shock, and although it has recently narrowed to about minus 2 to 3 percent, upward 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  momentum on prices has not been sufficiently strong. This shortage of demand reflects not only cyclical factors but also structural ones. As a result of globalization and the unparalleled decline in the birth rate and aging of the population, the environment surrounding Japan’s economy has changed dramatically but economic structures have been slow to adapt. As a consequence, economic growth has declined as a trend, lowering growth expectations, which in turn has led to a chronic shortage of demand. Due to this shortage, many firms have cut costs, mainly by reducing wages. Despite these efforts, however, corporate profits have not increased because fierce price competition has prevented firms from raising prices on their goods. Consequently, unable to foresee a clear improvement in profits, firms have inevitably turned cautious about increasing fixed investment, employment, and wages. 3. Importance of strengthening the growth potential In order to overcome this situation, it is essential to strengthen the growth potential of the economy to raise firms’ and households’ medium- to long-term growth expectations and to resolve the chronic shortage of demand. Because it is impossible to halt the decline in the birth rate and the aging of the population in the short run, a prerequisite for strengthening the growth potential of the economy is to secure the labor force and raise the value added per worker (value-added productivity). In order to secure the labor force, it is important to (1) make the labor market more flexible, and (2) make it easier for labor to move from one industry to another and for women and the elderly to participate in the labor market. If the situation remains unaddressed and the labor force continues to decline, this will push down Japan’s annual economic growth rate in the 2010s by approximately 0.6 percentage point. This population issue is not unique to Japan. China’s labor force also started to decline in 2012, giving rise to a sense of crisis. A shrinking labor force is a problem that many other advanced and emerging countries will face in the near future. In Japan, it is estimated that if the labor force participation rate of women were to rise to the level of Sweden by 2030 and that of the elderly (those aged 60 and over) were also to rise, the Japanese labor force would increase at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in the 2010s. As for the employment of the elderly, in view of the gradual rise in the pensionable age of the national pension to 65, starting in April 2013 it will be mandatory for firms to provide employment to elderly workers who wish to keep working. Given that Japan succeeded in shifting from a retirement age of 55 to 60 toward the 1980s, it should be possible to create a society in which it is normal to work until the age of 65 or beyond through institutional reforms and changes in the way people work. To raise value-added productivity, it is necessary to build an economic environment where innovations in a broad sense – including the development of new business models – can be achieved more easily. Recently, firms have been making active efforts in a wide range of areas to capitalize on social changes, including business focusing on the elderly, the environment and energy, and information and telecommunications. If firms accelerate efforts on these fronts and reorient their strategies from concentrating on price competition to competition based on new goods and services, and if this is accompanied by increases in the labor force and value-added productivity, firms’ and households’ medium- to long-term growth expectations should rise amid vigorous economic activity. B. Fostering more accommodative financial conditions: maintaining a virtually zero interest rate policy and increasing asset purchases I will now explain the Bank’s powerful monetary easing measures to achieve the “price stability target” of 2 percent. The Bank is pursuing aggressive monetary easing through its commitment to continue with a virtually zero interest rate policy and purchases of financial assets for as long as the Bank judges appropriate. Through the Asset Purchase Program established on its balance sheet, the Bank purchases various financial assets – such as Japanese government securities (JGSs), CP, corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) – and conducts the fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral. The program is aimed at encouraging 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  declines in longer-term interest rates and various risk premiums to foster more accommodative financial conditions for firms and households to raise sufficient funds at low interest rates. The size of the Asset Purchase Program, which was set at about 35 trillion yen at the time of its establishment in October 2010, has successively been increased, and the amount outstanding of the program was about 65 trillion yen at the end of December 2012. The Bank will continue to significantly increase the amount outstanding of the program until it reaches about 101 trillion yen by the end of December 2013. In addition, the Bank decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 21 and 22, 2013 to introduce, after completing the current purchasing method, a method of purchasing a given amount of financial assets every month without setting any termination date. Specifically, from January 2014, the Bank will conduct purchases of financial assets totaling about 13 trillion yen each month for some time. As a result, the amount outstanding of the Asset Purchase Program will be increased further by about 10 trillion yen in 2014 – to about 111 trillion yen – and is expected to be maintained thereafter. C. Strengthening policy coordination between the government and the bank On January 22, 2013, the Bank released “Joint Statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan on Overcoming Deflation and Achieving Sustainable Economic Growth”. The Bank announced that it was setting the “price stability target” at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, and that, under this target, it would pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time. The Bank stated that it would ascertain whether there was any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. The government, on the other hand, announced that it would formulate and strongly promote measures for strengthening the competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy, and steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure with a view to ensuring the credibility of fiscal management. The government plays a crucial part in strengthening the growth potential of the economy. Specifically, strengthening the growth potential hinges on the cumulative efforts of firms and financial institutions to create and expand new business. In this context, the government plays a pivotal role in fostering, through regulatory and institutional reforms, an environment that encourages the private sector to take on new challenges. While the Bank continues to pursue aggressive monetary easing through measures such as large-scale purchases of JGSs, Japan’s fiscal imbalances – among the most serious in the world – could hamper the effects of monetary easing. If the credibility of Japan’s fiscal management were to falter, interest rates would likely rise, thereby making fiscal management more difficult and undermining the effects of monetary easing. In order to fully ensure the effectiveness of monetary easing, it is important for the government to ensure market credibility of fiscal consolidation. In this regard, the joint statement has profound significance in showing that the government and the Bank have clearly acknowledged each other’s roles and that they will work together to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth. D. Making use of accommodative financial conditions: providing a boost through the loan support program Given the Bank’s aggressive monetary easing I described earlier, financial conditions in Japan are extremely accommodative both in historical and international comparison. To be specific, in terms of firms’ funding costs, both short- and long-term average interest rates on new loan contracts have hit 1 percent – an unprecedented level. In terms of households’ borrowing costs, variable mortgage rates are below 1 percent and even 35-year fixed mortgage rates are around 2 percent. Moreover, financial institutions’ lending attitude remains accommodative, issuing conditions for CP and corporate bonds remain favorable on 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  the whole, and an environment has been maintained in which households and firms can feel secure that they can gain access to funds. Meanwhile, even at a time when there were strong headwinds generated by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the European debt problem, extremely accommodative financial conditions have been firmly maintained. In order for Japan’s economy to achieve sustainable growth with price stability, it is important that firms and households actually make use of the accommodative financial conditions for funding and increase investment and spending, which in turn will lead to an improvement in the aggregate supply and demand balance. As for recent developments in credit demand, although firms have shown signs of increasing their demand mainly for working capital and funds related to mergers and acquisitions, business fixed investment has been financed from cash flows, indicating that accommodative financial conditions have not been used to the fullest possible extent. To promote full use of the accommodative financial conditions, the Bank has established the Loan Support Program, consisting of the fund-provisioning measure to support strengthening the foundations for economic growth (hereafter the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility) and the fund-provisioning measure to stimulate bank lending (hereafter the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility). These facilities are offered for your use. 1. The growth-supporting funding facility The Growth-Supporting Funding Facility was introduced with the aim of supporting the flow of funds to areas with growth potential. With this facility, the Bank provides long-term funds at a low interest rate to financial institutions for their lending and investment to areas that are expected to contribute to strengthening Japan’s growth potential, such as medical and nursing care; environment and energy; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; and tourism. In addition to the lending arrangement under the main rules, the Bank has established special rules for a lending arrangement through which it extends loans to financial institutions for their equity investments and asset-based lending (ABL). In ABL, assets such as accounts receivable and inventories are used as eligible collateral. Moreover, the Bank has established special rules for another lending arrangement for small-lot investments and loans as well as for a U.S. dollar lending arrangement of 12 billion U.S. dollars – equivalent to 1 trillion yen – using the U.S. dollar reserves already held by the Bank, for foreign currency-denominated investments and loans. The total size of these lending arrangements making up the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility was set at about 5.5 trillion yen, of which nearly 4 trillion yen has already been disbursed by the Bank. The amount of lending and investment actually provided by financial institutions using this facility greatly exceeds the amount of loans disbursed by the Bank. This indicates that the Bank’s measures have been producing positive effects as a catalyst. 2. The stimulating bank lending facility In October 2012, the Bank introduced the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility with the aim of prompting financial institutions to take a more active stance and stimulating greater proactive credit demand of firms and households. With this facility, the Bank will provide long-term yen-denominated funds at a low cost to financial institutions that have increased their lending, at their request, up to an amount equivalent to the net increase in their lending for a period of 15 months until the end of March 2014. The lending, based on which the net increase is calculated, can be either yen-denominated or foreign currency-denominated. While it may be extraordinary for a central bank to support lending – particularly foreign-currency denominated lending – to firms located overseas or lending by domestic financial institutions’ overseas offices, Japanese firms’ international operations as well as financial institutions’ activities to provide funds for such operations are essential in capturing global demand, so that the Bank’s measure to support such lending contributes to strengthening Japan’s growth potential. Based on recent lending data, the amount of funds provided through the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility is expected to reach more than 15 trillion yen by the end of March 2014. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  E. Quantitative aspects of monetary easing The Bank will provide a massive amount of funds exceeding 50 trillion yen by the end of March 2014 under the Asset Purchase Program and the Loan Support Program, and the amount outstanding of these programs will exceed 120 trillion yen. Looking at the amount of funds disbursed by the Bank in terms of the monetary base, the ratio relative to nominal GDP in Japan is currently about 27 percent, the highest level among the advanced economies. When considering the additional funds of more than 50 trillion yen to be provided, the ratio will rise further by more than 10 percentage points to almost 40 percent. As these figures show, the Bank will proceed with unprecedentedly massive monetary easing this year. On this basis, it will continue to closely examine the financial and economic environment, and make policy decisions in a timely and appropriate manner. If the large amount of funds provided at low cost on the basis of these accommodative financial conditions is utilized effectively and invigorates corporate activity, this should bring an improvement in firms’ profit prospects and an increase in the expected rate of return on new investment. Once such a virtuous circle has taken hold, the accommodative financial conditions will have even stronger effects, and the virtuous circle will become more sustainable. As mentioned earlier, “price stability” is achieved in a situation in which the economy improves in a balanced and sustainable manner, accompanied by increases in employment, wages, and corporate profits, and prices rise moderately as a result. The Bank will do its utmost to fulfill its responsibility to achieve the “price stability target”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Graeme Wheeler: Decision making in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Speech by Mr Graeme Wheeler, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the University of Auckland Business School, Auckland, 7 March 2013. *      *      * I’m sure that central banking was the furthest thing from his mind when the British mountaineer, Eric Langmuir aptly said: “A decision without the pressure of consequence is hardly a decision at all”. Central bankers are often criticised for avoiding decisions, although leaving policy settings unchanged is often a major decision in itself. Sometimes they are accused of communicating in a secret code with the real meaning known only to other central bankers. So how do we undertake important policy decisions in the Reserve Bank and how do we endeavour to communicate? i) Operational independence In 1990, the Reserve Bank became the first modern central bank to have a legislated structure in which the government took the lead in setting the objective, while the central bank had operational independence in, and formal accountability for, the execution of monetary policy. New Zealand also led the way with flexible inflation targeting, a framework now widely adopted by central banks across the OECD region. The 1989 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act states that “the primary function of the Reserve Bank is to formulate and implement monetary policy directed to the economic objective of achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices”. The legislation created provision for a Policy Targets Agreement (PTA) between the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank. In practice, the PTA defines the objectives of the Bank, specifies an inflation range representing price stability and outlines considerations that the Bank must give weight to in framing monetary policy decisions. The current PTA, signed on 20 September 2012, introduces the goal of keeping future average CPI inflation near the two percent target mid-point of the one percent to three percent range. Like its predecessor PTAs, it also requires the Bank to seek to avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates, and the exchange rate. The Governor’s responsibilities and obligations are conferred and imposed under the 1989 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act, the 2009 AMLCFT Act, the 2010 Insurance (Prudential Supervision Act), to which is expected to be added the Non-Bank Deposit Takers legislation currently in the House. The Governor has the power to act for the Bank on all matters within the ambit of the Acts that are not required to be dealt with by the Board of the Reserve Bank (which relate to the appointment, remuneration and removal of the Deputy Governors). The Governor may delegate decision making authority to other officers of the Bank. ii) The bank’s span of responsibilities The Reserve Bank is a full service central bank and its responsibilities are broader than most other central banks. Not all central banks are responsible for prudential and regulatory oversight of the banking and payment systems, or have the authority to undertake exchange rate intervention. In addition, the Bank has an extensive programme of financial stability-related initiatives underway that includes Open Bank Resolution, the introduction of macro-prudential instruments, a review of the payments system, and implementation of Basel III capital requirements. The Bank has also taken on responsibilities for anti-money laundering and regulation of insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  iii) Important checks and balances The checks and balances and accountability mechanisms relating to the Bank are considerable and include: • Publication of an annual report, at least two Monetary Policy Statements (we do four), and two semi-annual Financial Stability Reports. The Bank’s reports are reviewed by Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee, the Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank, and the Bank provides press conferences around each Monetary Policy Statement and Financial Stability Report. • External auditing of the Bank’s financial reporting, oversight by the Audit Committee of the Reserve Bank Board, and a strong in-house internal auditing function that reports to the Governor and works closely with the Board’s Audit Committee. • Publication of regulatory impact assessments of any prudential policy that it adopts. • Monitoring and oversight by the Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank, which acts as agent to the Minister of Finance in reviewing how well the Bank meets its legislative responsibilities. The Board reviews the Bank’s performance under the PTA, and its efforts to promote the maintenance of a sound and efficient financial system. In considering the Bank’s monetary policy decisions, the Directors receive all of the papers discussed by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, the written advice that the Governor receives from individual members of the Monetary Policy Committee, and webcasts of the Governor’s press conferences.   The Board meets nine times a year (four times a year outside of Wellington where receptions are held with the business community) and provides advice to the Governor on various management issues. The Board assesses the Bank’s performance in meeting its obligations and responsibilities, discusses this with the Minister of Finance, and publishes its review in the Bank’s Annual Report. • The Minister of Finance’s powers under the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act to direct the Bank to formulate and implement monetary policy for different economic objectives to those specified in Section 8, and to determine the basis for foreign exchange intervention by the Bank. The most coercive powers exercisable against registered banks may only be exercised by the Minister, or with his consent. These powers must be exercised transparently, and have not to date been used. iv) The policy decision making framework In order to assist with major policy decisions, we recently introduced a Governing Committee, comprising the Governor, the two Deputy Governors and the Assistant Governor, under the chairmanship of the Governor. The Governing Committee will discuss all major monetary and financial policy decisions falling under the Bank’s responsibilities, including decisions on monetary policy, foreign exchange intervention, liquidity management policy, prudential policy (both micro and macro) and other regulatory policies. To date, individual Governors have taken responsibility for particular areas of the Bank, such as operations, monetary policy and financial stability. Going forward Governors will have more individual and collective involvement in key decisions taken across all areas of the Bank. This is the same decision making framework adopted by the Bank of Canada, which also has a single decision maker model. As with the Bank of Canada, the Governor retains the right of veto on committee decisions. The Committee formalises and expands past practice. Several other central banks, including the central banks of Brazil, Mexico, and Sweden, make monetary policy through a central committee comprising the Governors, although sometimes other internal members are included. These committees benefit decision making by pooling the knowledge, wisdom, and expertise of individual Governors. Such committees 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  bring strength, especially where considerable uncertainty is involved, and can mitigate extreme preferences of an individual.  The Bank’s Governors team has extensive experience inside and outside the Reserve Bank. While the change represents a management rather than governance initiative, the Governing Committee will maximise the knowledge and experience of the Governors individually and as a collective, rigorously test ideas and build consensus around major policy decisions. Analytical and policy papers are discussed in several important committees including the Monetary Policy Committee, Macro-financial Committee, Financial System Oversight Committee, and the Assets and Liabilities Committee (which examines impacts of portfolio decisions and changing relative prices on the Bank’s balance sheet). These committees have clear terms of reference, mainly meet fortnightly, and are chaired by a Governor. Usually decisions are taken at the committee meeting, but major and complex policy decisions will often be referred to the Governing Committee. Management decisions are taken at weekly meetings of the Bank’s Senior Management Group and all communications issues and requests are discussed weekly at the Communications Committee. v) Communicating policy decisions We are expanding our on-the-record speaking by increasing the number of speeches, broadening the range of topics while remaining within the Reserve Bank’s framework, and increasing the number of speakers. At the same time, the Bank will continue its extensive off-the-record briefings to groups ranging in size from 15 to 400 people, but we will become more selective in the 80–100 briefings we provide each year. We are also expanding our communications through social media, in-house videos, webcasts and other online channels.  We provide considerable background briefings to the media, but announce our policy decisions through our publications, speeches, and press conferences. We will also provide six-monthly briefings to the caucuses of the political parties, and are redesigning our website to expand its information content and increase its accessibility. To be effective, monetary policy requires transparency in terms of policy goals and how these are to be achieved. The former is contained in the Policy Targets Agreement; the latter through our Monetary Policy Statements, OCR announcements, speeches and press conferences. In commenting on monetary policy decisions and especially those relating to the official cash rate, we are conscious that traders pre-position themselves prior to policy announcements and that the exchange rate and interest rate spreads can alter depending on the policy decision and the language that accompanies it. Above all, we want policy statements to accurately reflect the economic conjuncture and outlook as we see it, and the range of considerations we are weighing in fulfilling our responsibilities. In the case of monetary policy, these include implementing monetary policy in a sustainable, consistent, and transparent manner, having regard to the efficiency and soundness of the financial system, and seeking to avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates, and the exchange rate. The 90-day interest rate projection contained in the Monetary Policy Statement is a form of forward guidance as to our expectations of movements in the Bank’s Official Cash Rate. It is intended to help businesses and households plan with greater confidence in managing their consumption patterns and saving and investment decisions, and to help shape expectations about the future path of inflation and interest rates. This also helps market participants to anticipate the Reserve Bank’s policy responses as new data becomes available. As with most conditional projections, the interest rate path is affected by the risks and uncertainties that usually increase with time. In practice, the balance of language around the projection is at least as important as the projection itself in shaping expectations of the outlook. When market expectations adjust smoothly and efficiently, it can diminish the need for larger policy adjustments by the central bank that could otherwise unsettle markets and have greater impacts on asset prices and spending decisions. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Concluding comments Global financial markets are still dealing with the major regulatory changes and the massive adjustments taking place in government, corporate, financial sector and household balance sheets in economies that generate around two thirds of world output and over three quarters of cross border capital flows. The spill-overs from these adjustments and the fiscal and monetary responses to them can be especially challenging in small open economies with stronger growth prospects, and where there are high expectations of what central banks can achieve. The Reserve Bank endeavours to provide an accurate assessment of the implications and challenges of these adjustments for the New Zealand economy. In doing so, we seek to be clear on what we can and cannot influence, and how government policy instruments and private sector responses can increase our effectiveness. At the same time we’ve been extending our regulatory oversight, building the protections available to taxpayers in the event of bank failure, and increasing the range and scope of instruments to help deliver price stability and increase the efficiency and soundness of the domestic financial system.  Within the Bank we are looking to the team of Governors to debate major policy matters leading to decisions, and increasing the frequency and scope of our on-the-record reporting.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: The Philippine economy – primes for a sustainable and solid growth Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank of the Philippines), at the Euromoney Philippine Investment Forum, Manila, 12 March 2013. *      *      * Secretary Cesar Purisima, other government officials, Mr. Tony Shale, CEO of Euromoney Institutional Investor Asia, distinguished leaders and members of the business and investor community, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Over the recent period, there has been a welcome spate of rosy and positive commentaries on the Philippine economy. We have been described as an emerging Asian tiger. The venerable New York Times has labeled the Philippines as the economic bright spot in Asia. The World Bank has observed that macroeconomic stability is now the new normal in the Philippines. The IMF has singled out the Philippines for being the only country whose growth forecast it has upgraded. The IMF 2013 growth forecast was set at 4.7 percent earlier on but was revised twice to reach 6 percent this January.1 The IMF is not the only multilateral financial institution that has upgraded the growth forecast of the Philippine economy. The World Bank upgraded its outlook on the Philippines’ 2013 economic growth from 5 percent (October) to 6.2 percent (December).2 The Asian Development Bank likewise raised its earlier 2013 forecast of 4.8 percent (April 2012) to 5.5 percent 6 months later (October).3 These assessments are consistent with the series of sovereign credit rating upgrades received by the Philippines even as the credit ratings of many other countries have been downgraded. In fact, it could be said that the financial markets have already voted the Philippines as investment grade as evident in the pricing of our credit default risk in the same range as investment grade economies. All these assessments were driven mainly by the solid performance of the Philippine economy across various metrics. These include: • Robust and broad-based economic growth; • Low and stable inflation; • Strong external payments position;                                                  1 IMF Statement at the Conclusion of the 2013 Article IV Consultation Mission to the Philippines, Press Release No. 13/21, January 23, 2013 2 The World Bank East Asia and Pacific Economic Update December 2012 3 Asian Development Outlook 2012 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • Sound and stable banking system; and • Much improved fiscal performance. These macroeconomic conditions did not happen by chance. Far from it. In fact, these trends are all the more noteworthy in that they are happening against a backdrop of persistent and strong headwinds in the global economy. The progress in the economic front is the outcome of prudent and disciplined monetary and fiscal policymaking. And these conditions are sustainable because of strong and well-grounded policy frameworks in place. These include: 1. The government is committed to sound fiscal policy. The government is appropriately focused on strengthening the quality of fiscal adjustments. It has increased spending for critical social priorities and economic infrastructures while keeping a watchful eye on the medium-term objective of fiscal consolidation. 2. The government continues to pursue a reform agenda that is aimed at raising the economy’s flexibility and unlocking the country’s growth potential. 3. A forward-looking monetary policy framework that has helped strengthen our commitment to non-inflationary economic growth. We have met our inflation target for the past consecutive four years (2009–2012), even as the economy’s engines have powered ahead; 4. An enhanced policy toolkit that is geared to respond to the challenges brought about by strong capital inflows; 5. Finally, supervisory and regulatory practices that are benchmarked against international best practices. This is reflected in well-capitalized and better-governed banks that are able to efficiently perform financial intermediation and risk management. There are therefore fundamental reasons to believe that continued macroeconomic discipline and reforms can push the growth trajectory further to a path that will allow the economy to not only survive the global headwinds but to adapt and to thrive in a more challenging operating environment. As we are aware of the headway that has been made, we are equally mindful of the challenges and the risks to the favorable economic outlook. I can assure you that there are a lot of “responsible adults” in the room. These are policymakers who are attentive to the overt as well as the underappreciated risks to the Philippine growth story. What are the challenges? What are the latent pressure points in the economy? Let me cite three major ones, from the BSP’s standpoint: 1. Managing capital flow surges – an issue repeatedly mentioned this morning 2. Ensuring financial stability 3. Going the distance with structural reforms In this challenging period of very strong capital flows and expectations of continuing strong capital flows, or as one economist has called it the whipsaw of huge capital movements, the question is – do monetary authorities still have the firepower and yet be market-friendly in their policy responses? To this, my response is yes. The BSP has recognized long ago the need to deploy a deep toolkit in addressing the contemporary challenges confronting emerging market central banks that are at the receiving end of strong capital flows. It has used a variety of instruments to achieve low and stable inflation, prevent excessive volatility in the exchange rate and maintain broad financial stability. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  As a result of BSP’s signature circumspection, the evidence suggests that the sizable FX inflows have not led to significant adverse macroeconomic and financial consequences. • Reserve accumulation in response to the surges in capital inflows does not appear to have led to excessive money creation. • The limited impact of capital flows on monetary aggregate growth suggests that sterilization policies have been broadly effective. • Credit growth has not contributed to macroeconomic imbalances, as inflation has remained low. A second – and related – challenge is the need to ensure continued financial stability. The recent global financial crisis showed that sole focus on price stability is not sufficient to attain macroeconomic stability. Policymakers need to deliver more than stable prices if they are to achieve sustained and stable growth. Price stability does not guarantee financial stability. The BSP, therefore, is attentive to pressure points that could impact on both price stability and financial stability. To ensure financial stability we have utilized prudential measures to manage capital inflows and moderate, if not prevent, the build-up of excesses in specific sectors and in the banking system. Prudential policies are the instrument of choice and employed as the first line of defense against financial stability risks. Given the current regime of low interest rates – driven in large part by the surge of foreign capital into domestic financial markets and the limited absorptive capacity of the economy in the short term – the BSP is keeping a watchful eye on developments in the asset markets. We pay particular attention to what is happening in the equity and property markets, as these markets are interest-rate sensitive and could be prone to bubbly behavior. We see that while activity in these markets has been buoyant, the key indicators are growing broadly within trend, reflecting both cyclical as well as structural or fundamental forces. It is also important to note that indebtedness in the Philippines is still quite low. Domestic credit-to-GDP ratio at 50.4 percent (Q4 2012) still ranks one of the lowest in the region.4 This would suggest that the risk of excessive leverage is less and the threat to financial stability is likewise lower, should asset prices correct. The third challenge involves going the distance in the pursuit of the reform agenda. 1. We are implementing the capital adequacy framework of Basel III in January 2014. We will also be closely studying the other building blocks of the Basel III reform agenda to see how and when we can incorporate these into domestic regulatory environment. 2. Capital market reform will be a priority. This will include ensuring that an appropriate market infrastructure is in place. The infrastructure will not only improve the quality of markets, which will help mitigate financial stability risk. But infrastructure will also promote the absorption of the inflows, which will ultimately lead to an expansion of the economy. By improving financial intermediation in the system, a well-functioning capital market will help unlock the economy’s productive potential and strengthen its capacity to withstand shocks. Right now, we see an economy that is on an even keel, on surer footing, poised for higher growth, riding on a momentum of change that offers the promise of not only stronger growth but also one that is more inclusive and more durable.                                                 4 Note: Latest available: Indonesia 40.2; Malaysia 133.3; Singapore 151.8; Thailand 129.4; Japan 221.2; China 153.1; Korea 104.1 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The challenge is to keep the momentum of positive change strong. The appropriate response to current favorable winds is not to sit back and relax, not to pop champagne corks as William asked this morning, but to treat them as an ideal opportunity to strengthen the underpinnings of the economy’s foundations. The BSP will strive to have monetary policy that will provide an environment where credit and liquidity growth will remain supportive of economic growth while maintaining price stability. We will also continue to work on reforms that will deepen the financial system. We will continue to monitor financial and asset markets and be responsive to emerging risks. We will continue to work with the government in pushing the agenda for reforms to ensure macroeconomic stability.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Duvvuri Subbarao: India’s macroeconomic challenges – some Reserve Bank perspectives Text of the Fifth I.G. Patel Memorial Lecture by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the London School of Economics, London, 13 March 2013. *      *      * First of all many thanks to the London School of Economics for inviting me to deliver the fifth I.G. Patel Memorial Lecture. It is an honour to which I attach immense value. Dr. I.G. Patel 2. Dr. I.G. Patel represents a special bond between our two institutions – the Reserve Bank which I represent and the LSE where this lecture is instituted. Dr. Patel led both these institutions with great dignity and distinction, and is loved and respected by both our institutions. 3. Because the occasion demands it, I must repeat what I said at the Reserve Bank’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2010. 4. Those of you who have an interest in the history of science would know that Sir Isaac Newton was known, among other things, also for his intellectual arrogance. When his friend and rival, Robert Hooke wrote to him, lauding his theory of gravity, Newton, for all his arrogance, wrote back with uncharacteristic humility: “If I have been able to see a little farther than others, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.” 5. That is a statement I can relate to. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank in these exciting times, I owe an intellectual debt of gratitude to the extraordinary men who led the Reserve Bank through several challenges, and made a mark in the economic history of India. Among the most distinguished of them is Dr. I.G. Patel. I am privileged to be in the same lineage as him. 6. During his long and illustrious career in India, Dr. Patel made very significant and lasting contribution to economic governance of India. He was Governor of the Reserve Bank at a critical time when the Indian economy had to battle a balance of payments crisis triggered by the second oil price shock in the late 1970s. He played an active role in securing accommodation for India from the IMF’s Extended Fund facility, an arrangement that was the largest in the Fund’s history at that time. 7. Indeed, Dr. Patel was the intellectual force behind resolving some of our biggest macroeconomic challenges of his time. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank today, I am involved in addressing some of India’s current macroeconomic challenges. The leadership that my predecessors provided in confronting these challenges always remains a source of motivation and inspiration for me in navigating through these challenges. I thought the best way I can honour the memory of late Dr. I.G. Patel is to talk about India’s current macroeconomic challenges from the Reserve Bank’s perspective. India – current macroeconomic context 8. India clocked an average growth of 9.5 per cent in the three year period before the global financial crisis (2005-08). For a nation that once believed that the “Hindu Rate of Growth” was its destiny, this remarkable growth performance was cause for celebration. It was also a trigger for setting off an aspiration for double digit growth. 9. Today, there is a sharp reversal. Growth has decelerated, inflation is still high and stubborn, the investment rate has declined sharply and the external sector is beset with a 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  record high current account deficit. This downturn has caused widespread anxiety that we may have got derailed from the high growth trajectory. It has also raised a number of questions. Is our growth story faltering? Has India’s potential growth rate declined? Are the growth drivers that worked our way during 2003–08 still intact? Has the world lost confidence in India’s growth promise? When will we reach double digit growth, and what indeed should we be doing to get there? 10. My short answer to all these questions is that the India growth story is still credible and that the long term growth drivers are still intact. If we do the right things, we can get back on a high growth trajectory. Equally, there is nothing inevitable about the India growth story. We can accelerate growth and improve welfare only if we effectively implement wide ranging economic and governance reforms. Slipping up on this will amount to a costly and potentially irreversible squandering away of opportunities. 11. The Government has to be at the center of this and lead the process of economic revival. As the central bank and as the regulator of large segments of the financial sector, the Reserve Bank too has an important role to play in this. What I propose to do today is to discuss some important macroeconomic challenges from the Reserve Bank’s perspective. 12. In particular, I will discuss three challenges: (i) Managing growth-inflation dynamics (ii) Mitigating the vulnerability of external sector (iii) Managing the political economy of fiscal consolidation First challenge: managing growth-inflation dynamics Growth 13. The global financial crisis affected virtually every economy in the world, and India was no exception. But we recovered from the crisis much sooner than even other emerging economies. In the crisis year of 2008/09, growth dropped to 6.7 per cent, but it recovered smartly thereafter. In fact, in the two years after the crisis, 2008/09 and 2009/10, growth averaged 9.0 per cent which compares favourably with the average growth of 9.5 per cent in the three years before the crisis. However, last year, 2011/12, growth moderated to 6.2 per cent, and the first advance estimates suggest that growth this year may drop further to 5.0 per cent, the lowest in a decade (Chart-1). 14. To understand the latest downtrend, it is important first to understand the pre-crisis growth surge. Several explanations are offered for India’s growth acceleration in the pre-crisis period: the impact of economic reforms of the 1990s; India’s rapid integration with the global economy; rise of entrepreneurism; and increase in productivity. 15. Underlying all these factors was the massive increase in capacity as investment jumped from 26.9 per cent of GDP in 2003/04 to 38.1 per cent in 2007/08 (Chart-2). This increase in investment was financed by growing domestic saving, and was accompanied by an increase in productivity driven by improvements in technology, organization, financial intermediation and external and domestic competitiveness. The current account deficit (CAD) during this period averaged just 0.3 per cent of GDP suggesting that the contribution of foreign savings to domestic investment was relatively modest. But to the extent foreign saving came by way of foreign direct investment (FDI), it raised the productivity of overall investment and resulted in higher exports. 16. In the immediate post-crisis period, even as investment slowed, private consumption demand, which accounts for about 57 per cent of GDP, held up as rural incomes grew robustly on the back of the crisis driven stimulus as well as the expanded safety-net programmes of the government. This kept growth up but also fuelled inflation reflecting excess of demand over supply. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  17. So, what explains the downturn in growth over the last two years? The answer would be a slowing of demand across the board. Private investment decelerated sharply, in part reflecting the global downturn, but largely owing to domestic factors. Business profitability was dented by tightening infrastructure constraints and increasing input prices stemming from high food and fuel inflation. Business confidence was hit by a rising fiscal deficit, vacillating commitment to reforms and governance concerns, all of which dampened investor perceptions on returns to investment. 18. On top of the decline in private investment, private consumption demand, which was the bulwark of the quick recovery from the crisis, too started slowing in recent years exacerbating the growth slowdown (Chart-3). It is estimated to have slowed to 4.1 per cent during the current year, down from an average of 8.3 per cent in the previous two years. Inflation 19. Just as India recovered from the crisis sooner than other countries, inflation too caught up with us sooner than elsewhere. Inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), went briefly into negative territory for a few months in 2009 but started rising sharply thereafter, clocking a peak rate of 10.9 per cent in April 2010. Average WPI inflation was 9.6 per cent in fiscal year 2010/11, 8.9 per cent in 2011/12 and 7.5 per cent during the first ten months of 2012/13 (Chart-4). The story therefore is that at 8.7 per cent, the average inflation over the last three years has been higher than the average inflation of 5.4 per cent during the previous decade (2000–10) What is driving inflation? 20. Both supply side and demand side factors have contributed to the buildup of inflationary pressures. 21. A major driver from the supply side has been food inflation, which has both structural and cyclical components. The structural component arises from rising incomes, especially in rural areas, which is leading to a shift in dietary habits from cereals to protein foods. Inflation of protein food prices remained in double digits for much of the last three years barring a few months (Chart-5). The cyclical component of food inflation arises from the monsoon related spike in prices of food items such as vegetables. Notwithstanding all the talk of drought proofing the economy, the timely onset of the monsoon and its spatial and temporal distribution continue to influence the inflation outlook in India. 22. The second major factor driving the current episode of inflation has been global commodity prices, especially the price of crude oil. India imports 80 per cent of its oil demand. The global price of oil is therefore an important variable in determining the inflation outlook. The depreciation of the rupee, starting October 2011, has compounded the inflationary impact of oil prices. 23. If the domestic petroleum sector was a free market and if global prices passed through to domestic prices, demand would arguably have declined in response to rising prices. But such a demand adjustment was blocked by the administered (subsidized) pricing regime of petroleum products. 24. Subsidization did not, however, protect us from inflation pressures – the cost of subsidies raised the fiscal deficit which fuelled inflation. So, any softening of inflation that we gained through subsidization was offset by a larger fiscal deficit. 25. There is a debate in India about the macroeconomic and welfare dimensions of subsidies financed, not by government surpluses, but by government borrowing. An argument against de-subsidization is that it will be inflationary. Sure, it will be inflationary in the short-term, but price pressures will even out over the medium term. Also, the inflation impact should not be overstated. To the extent lower subsidies result in a lower fiscal deficit, there would be some 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  disinflationary impact even in the short-term. Finally, reduction in subsidies will remove price distortions, improve efficiency and provide a much better investment environment. 26. The third major factor fuelling inflation has been wage pressures. Nominal rural wages increased at double digit rates over the last five years. Indeed, they increased so rapidly that, despite high retail inflation, real wage growth surged close to double digits in the last three years (Table-1). The Government’s social safety-net programmes contributed to, and sustained, the wage-price spiral. In an economy with a per capita income of about US $1500, any increase in income quickly translates into increase in consumption demand and that is exactly what was witnessed in India. Producers were able, until very recently, to pass on the higher input prices in the form of higher output prices without sacrificing their margins. Growth-inflation dynamics 27. India’s growth-inflation dynamics pre-crisis and post-crisis present a study in contrast. In the three year period before the crisis, the economy expanded by 9.5 per cent on average, aided by growth in fixed investment above 15 per cent per year. This expanded production capacity to match growing demand and kept core inflation in check. Post-crisis, the story reversed. Investment declined to half its pre-crisis rate whereas consumption demand remained at the pre-crisis level until last year, owing partly to the government’s entitlement and welfare programmes, opening up a positive output gap during 2009–11 and stoking core inflation. Two questions about growth-inflation dynamics 28. The growth-inflation dynamics of recent years that I briefly summarized above raise two interesting and related policy questions. The first is about India’s potential growth rate and the second is about why inflation is persisting at an elevated level even in the face of steeply moderating output growth. Let me briefly address them. What is India’s potential growth rate? 29. There is considerable evidence from research done at the IMF and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) that potential growth rates may have declined significantly in both advanced and emerging economies. India too, despite being less integrated with the global economy than other EMEs, has seen a drop in its potential growth rate. Reserve Bank estimates show that the potential growth before the crisis was in the range of 8.0–8.5 per cent. This estimate was scaled down to 7.0 per cent after the crisis owing to a host of factors – decline in the pace of capital formation, supply constraints, especially of infrastructure, pressure on factor productivity because of tepid progress on reforms and a high fiscal deficit. 30. Some analysts contend that the potential growth rate may have dipped even below the Reserve Bank’s post-crisis estimate of 7 per cent. The argument is that with growth dipping below 7 per cent last year and projected to dip even lower this year, we should have seen inflation and current account deficit soften. On the other hand, inflation persists at an elevated level and the current account deficit is likely to be the highest ever, suggesting that the economy is growing beyond its capacity and that the potential growth may be lower than even 7 per cent. Why are India’s growth-inflation dynamics contrarian? 31. The second and related question is about why India’s macroeconomic dynamics are contrarian. In particular, over the last two years, many of our peer EMEs have also experienced a growth deceleration, but in line with standard theory, several of them have also seen a moderation in their inflation rates. In India, however, inflation has not come down in line with growth deceleration. Several idiosyncratic factors are put forward to explain this uniqueness of our macroeconomic situation: supply bottlenecks, particularly in infrastructure, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  sectoral imbalances, rise in wages without a corresponding increase in productivity, higher fiscal deficit and larger depreciation of the exchange rate than in the case of our peers. Reserve Bank’s action to curb inflation 32. To control inflation, the Reserve Bank reversed the crisis period’s accommodative monetary stance in quick order. We raised the policy interest rate (repo rate) 13 times, cumulatively by 375 basis points (bps) – from 4.75 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Also we raised the reserve requirement on banks – the cash reserve ratio (CRR) – by 100 bps from 5 per cent to 6 per cent. Monetary policy is known to work with lags, and as a consequence of the tight monetary policy, WPI inflation which peaked at 10.9 per cent in April 2010, has come down to 6.6 per cent in January 2013. 33. In response to deceleration in growth and decline in inflation, the Reserve Bank eased the monetary policy stance starting January 2012 cutting both the repo rate (by 75 bps) and the CRR (by 200 bps). Criticism against Reserve Bank’s monetary policy stance 34. The Reserve Bank has been criticized for its anti-inflationary stance. Let me address some of the main strands of that criticism if only to illustrate the dilemmas that we face in managing the growth-inflation trade-off. Monetary policy has only stifled growth, but has not tamed inflation 35. By far the most common criticism has been that tight monetary policy has stifled growth but has not tamed inflation. My response to this criticism is the following. First, inflation has come off from its peak by over about 4 percentage points. Admittedly, growth too has moderated. However, the Reserve Bank’s anti-inflation stance is motivated by the dictum that inflation is inimical to growth and that only in a situation of price stability can consumers and investors make informed choices. 36. It is important also to note that in order to contain inflation, monetary policy seeks to curb demand which, in turn, restrains growth. As per this logic, reduction in growth is an inevitable outcome of tight monetary policy. But this sacrifice is only in the short-term. In the medium term, there is no growth-inflation trade off; on the contrary, low and stable inflation secures sustained high medium term growth. And this is what the Reserve Bank is aiming at. 37. It is important to note in this context that the relationship between growth and inflation is non-linear. At low levels of inflation and stable inflation expectations, there is a trade-off between growth and inflation – some inflation can be tolerated to grease the wheels of growth. But above a certain threshold level of inflation, this relationship reverses, the conventional trade-off disappears, and high inflation actually starts taking a toll on growth. Estimates by the Reserve Bank using different methodologies put the threshold level of inflation in the range of 4 to 6 per cent. Inflation above 6 per cent would therefore justify, indeed demand, tightening of the monetary policy stance. It is this understanding that informed the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy stance. Monetary policy tightening is inappropriate to combat supply shock driven inflation 38. A second and related criticism of the Reserve Bank’s anti-inflationary monetary policy stance has been that India’s recent inflation is driven by supply shocks in food and fuel items and that monetary tightening does not help restrain inflation in such a case. It only results in avoidable sacrifice of growth. 39. I have several responses to this criticism. The first is that inflation was driven not just by supply shocks but by demand pressures as well, as evidenced by output expanding faster than the potential growth rate in the immediate post-crisis years of 2009/10 and 2010/11, the large and growing current account deficit and rapid growth in consumption demand. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  40. Admittedly, there were supply shocks too, in addition to demand pressures that were stoking inflation pressures. Monetary policy response to supply shocks is a deliberate balancing act because errors can be costly in terms of lost growth. If the judgement is that the supply shock is transitory (such as cyclical increase in vegetable prices), the preferred policy response should be to not respond by monetary tightening. If on the other hand, the judgement is that the supply shock is structural in nature and will persist, monetary policy has to respond since persistent inflation, no matter what the driver, stokes inflation expectations. Monetary policy is inevitably the first line of defence to guard against inflation getting generalized through unhinged inflation expectations. The Reserve Bank’s policy response has been guided by the above consideration. 41. To sum up, the surmise from the challenge posed by the growth-inflation dynamics is the following. Today’s investment is tomorrow’s production capacity. India needs to not only reverse the investment downturn but also increase it significantly to raise production to match the growing consumption demand. Increase in investment is necessary also to raise production for exports and thereby create jobs at home. Making this happen requires a supply response from the government by way of providing public goods and creating a conducive environment for private investment. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank has to ensure that inflation is brought down to the threshold level and is maintained there. Second challenge: mitigating the vulnerability of the external sector 42. Over the last two years, India’s balance of payments (BoP) has come under growing pressure as evidenced most clearly by a large and increasing current account deficit (CAD). The CAD last year (2011/12) was 4.2 per cent of GDP, historically the highest; the CAD during the current year is expected to be even higher. 43. Many will recall that India went through a balance of payments crisis in 1991 which, in fact, triggered wide ranging structural reforms that gave a market orientation to the economy. Despite India’s growing integration with the global economy, the external sector remained robust for over 15 years after that. The current episode of BoP pressures, when the CAD is higher than it was at the peak of the 1991 BoP crisis (3 per cent of GDP) is, therefore, causing apprehensions about whether we have the capacity to stem the pressures and restore the BoP to a sustainable path. 44. The increase in CAD is quite evidently a consequence of imports growing faster than exports. (Table-2) 45. The increase in imports is largely accounted for by oil and gold imports. To understand the pressure these two items have put on the BoP, it is instructive to note the following. Net of oil and gold imports, CAD last year would have been in surplus of 3.8 per cent of GDP in contrast to a deficit of 4.2 per cent of GDP. The surge in gold imports is explained largely by the erosion in real returns on other assets owing to inflation. The reason oil imports have been price inelastic is due to the fact that nearly 60 per cent of petroleum products pass through an administered price regime; oil demand to that extent does not adjust to price increases. On the other hand, exports were not helped even though the real exchange rate depreciated, reflecting the fact that in a subdued global economy, exports are more sensitive to income (i.e. global demand) than to price. 46. Reflecting the current and capital accounts in the BoP, the exchange rate depreciated both in nominal and real terms (Table-3) Three concerns about CAD 47. There are mainly three concerns about the CAD in the balance of payments: (i) the quantum of CAD; (ii) the quality of CAD; and (iii) the financing of CAD. Let me briefly address each of these. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Quantum of CAD 48. Reserve Bank’s estimates show that the sustainable CAD for India is 2.5 per cent of GDP. A CAD above the sustainable level, year after year, is a clear macroeconomic risk as it raises concerns about our ability to meet our external payment obligations and erodes the confidence of potential lenders and investors. 49. An additional concern is that we are having a large CAD even in the face of slowing growth. This is perplexing because economic logic suggests that the CAD should improve in a slowing economy due to a decline in import demand. Cross country evidence in fact supports this hypothesis. Such an adjustment has not manifested in India though because: (i) oil and gold imports are relatively inelastic to income changes; (ii) on non-oil imports, domestic supply is still unable to compete with imports, and (iii) supply constraints and subdued external demand are impeding exports. Quality of CAD 50. The concern about the quality of CAD arises from the composition of imports. If we were importing capital goods, we can maybe countenance a higher CAD because investment in capital goods implies building production capacity for tomorrow. On the other hand, import of gold, largely as a hedge against inflation, is a deadweight burden, especially at a time when the CAD is beyond the sustainable level. Financing of CAD 51. Even as the CAD has been high, we have been able to finance it because of a combination of “push” and “pull” factors. On the push side is the amount of surplus liquidity in the global system consequent upon the extraordinary monetary stimulus provided by advanced economy central banks. On the pull side are the measures taken by us to attract capital flows such as liberalizing FDI, expanding the limits for foreign investment in corporate and government debt and easing restrictions on external commercial borrowing by corporates. 52. In trying to finance such a large CAD, we are exposing the economy to the risk of sudden stop and exit of capital flows. This will be the case to the extent capital flows in in pursuit of short-term profits. Should the risk of capital exit materialize, the exchange rate will become volatile causing knock-on macroeconomic disruptions. Monetary easing in the context of a large CAD 53. While the external sector vulnerability is a cause for concern on a number of counts as I indicated above, it also poses a special challenge for calibrating the monetary policy stance. 54. In our quarterly policy review at the end of January this year, the Reserve Bank cut the benchmark repo rate by 25 bps in response to the growth-inflation dynamics that I outlined earlier. Several analysts and commentators have questioned the wisdom and logic of monetary easing at a time when the CAD is rising. There are two elements to this argument: (i) an interest rate cut raises aggregate demand, and hence demand for imports, and will aggravate an already elevated CAD; and (ii) an interest rate cut will narrow the interest differential between India and the advanced economies which are the source of capital, and could potentially lead to capital exit. 55. Let me respond to both these strands of criticism: 56. The risk of the CAD widening further because of the stimulus offered by the rate cut is much less than apprehended for a host of reasons. First, when growth is sluggish as is the case now, the rate cut is unlikely to translate into import demand. Second, the rate cut was a response to softening inflation. Lower inflation will improve the competitiveness of our exports. Third, the rate cut was effected during a phase of easing commodity prices – particularly of oil – which will reduce the pressure on the CAD. Finally, empirical evidence 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  shows that in emerging economies such as India, import demand is less a function of lower interest rate than of increased income. In other words, the marginal propensity to import by borrowing money is small. 57. On the other criticism about the impact of capital flows required to finance the CAD, it must be noted that interest rate differential is only one of the several push and pull factors that influence capital flows. Moreover, debt and equity flows have traditionally responded differently to a rate cut. While debt flows may be more sensitive to a narrowing of the interest rate differential, equity flows may actually increase because they see in this a signal of lower inflation and better investment environment. This has been the experience of India leading some analysis to all this, the “Indian exceptionalism”. 58. The last thought I want to leave with you on the issue of managing the external sector vulnerability is that gone are the days when monetary policy could be calibrated on entirely domestic macroeconomic considerations. As India integrates rapidly with the world in the years ahead, it will perforce have to take into account the spillover from global situation in determining its monetary policy stance. Third challenge: managing the political economy of fiscal consolidation 59. The large fiscal deficit of the government remains one of India’s biggest macroeconomic challenges. Received wisdom today is that it was the fiscal profligacy of the 1980s that spilled over into the external sector and fuelled the balance of payments crisis of 1991. In 2011/12, the combined fiscal deficit of the centre and state governments was 8.1 per cent, quite close to the figure of 9.1 per cent in the BoP crisis year of 1990/91 (Chart-6). Quite understandably, there are concerns about the adverse macroeconomic consequences of the twin deficit problem – a large and persistent fiscal deficit along with a high CAD. 60. There has been some very welcome, although much delayed, action on correcting both the CAD and the fiscal deficit over the last six months. The Government has raised customs duty on gold imports in an effort to restrain gold imports. More notably, the recent budget has firmly embraced fiscal responsibility by restraining the fiscal deficit next year consistent with the road map recommended by the Kelkar Committee. 61. In the pre-crisis period, India’s fiscal consolidation was largely on track, consistent with the targets adopted under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003. However, this consolidation got interrupted by the crisis induced fiscal stimulus. Thereafter, the government adopted a revised road map for getting fiscal consolidation back on track, and adhered to the target in 2012/13. Nevertheless, the combined fiscal debit of the centre and states, budgeted at 7.2 per cent of GDP during 2012/13 is still high. Notwithstanding political economy compulsions, credible fiscal adjustment along a transparent, predictable road map is an imperative for growth and macroeconomic stability. Why is fiscal deficit bad? 62. Fiscal deficit is bad for a number of reasons. Large and persistent fiscal deficit threatens the government’s debt sustainability. The growing interest burden eats into the resources available for discretionary expenditure. Importantly, it crowds out the private sector from the debt market, inhibits private investment and affects future production capacity. Fiscal deficit can also spill over and trigger balance of payments pressures as indeed happened in India in 1991. 63. By far the biggest concern stemming from a large fiscal deficit, especially from the Reserve Bank’s perspective, is that it adds to aggregate demand and thereby to inflation pressures. By crowding out the private sector, fiscal deficit could also inhibit, if not impair, monetary policy transmission to the private sector. Credible fiscal consolidation is, therefore, a necessary pre-condition for stabilizing inflation and securing non-inflationary growth. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Fiscal consolidation and growth 64. There are some concerns, admittedly marginal, that fiscal consolidation in a sluggish growth environment will only dampen growth further thereby adversely impacting revenues and pushing the economy into a vicious downward spiral. There is some validity to this argument. But a growth slow-down on account of fiscal consolidation is not unavoidable. Growth slow-down can be mitigated, indeed growth can be aided, provided attention is paid, along with the quantum of fiscal adjustment, also to its quality. Experience demonstrates that even if total expenditure as a proportion of GDP is curtailed, it need not dampen growth; on the contrary, if there is switching from current expenditure to capital expenditure, fiscal consolidation can actually stimulate growth by “crowding in” private investment. 65. Empirical estimates for India validate this finding – even in a context of decline in total public expenditure as a proportion to GDP, fiscal consolidation can improve medium-term growth prospects if government increases capital spending, offsetting the moderating impact of growth in the short-term. These results reflect the higher long-run fiscal multipliers for capital expenditure and very low long-run multipliers for current expenditure. 66. The economics of fiscal consolidation are quite straight forward. The complexity arises from the political economy. Tax increases and expenditure compression – the two strands of fiscal consolidation – are never politically popular, especially in democracies where political executives, virtually everywhere in the world, are characterized by high discount rates. They are much more tempted by short-term political pay offs rather than long-term sustainability. Fiscal consolidation, by definition, is a long-term game. In the short-term political costs may exceed benefits; in the long-term, the economic and political benefits far outweigh any costs. It is this congruence of economic and political virtue that must inform fiscal consolidation. Summing-up: India growth story intact 67. Let me now sum up. I have spoken to you about the following three macroeconomic challenges confronting India and I have given you the Reserve Bank’s perspective on them. (i) Managing the growth-inflation dynamics (ii) Mitigating the vulnerability of the external sector (iii) Managing the Political Economy of Fiscal Consolidation 68. These are formidable challenges, but by no means insurmountable. For people who despair, it is important to remember that the drivers of the India growth story – get up and go entrepreneurism, the demographic dividend, a large and growing middle class, the opportunity for productivity catch up, democracy and a decent legal system – are all intact. 69. The 12th Five Year Plan aims at a growth rate of 8.2 per cent for the Plan period  (2012–17). Growth at this pace is the minimum necessary. Indeed, India needs to grow even faster, at a sustained double digit pace, if it has to pull hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. The India growth story has all the ingredients to deliver on this promise. 70. But the India growth story is not inevitable. It will not materialize in the absence of vigorous and purposeful structural and governance reforms. It is those reforms that must continue to engage our attention.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Benoît Cœuré: The way back to financial integration Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Conference on “International financial integration and fragmentation. Drivers and policy responses”, organized by the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee and the Bank of Spain, Madrid, 12 March 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank Bernd Schwaab, Simone Manganelli and Lorenzo Cappiello for their contributions to this speech. I remain solely responsible for the opinions expressed herein. Dear Governor Linde, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the Banco de España for having invited me to speak at this conference. It is a great pleasure for me to be here in Madrid. In my speech I would like to discuss the reasons for the current state of fragmentation of the euro area and ways to remedy this situation, including through the completion of the banking union. The point I will make is that financial integration is desirable for an efficient allocation of resources in our economy, but that it will have to assume a different form to also ensure stability is delivered. To this end, I will elaborate on two interrelated issues. First, I will consider past and current developments in the degree of financial integration in the euro area. The Financial Integration Reports of the ECB have documented quite clearly that financial integration had steadily improved until the financial crisis erupted. The degree of financial integration then decreased in a number of market segments, although there have been signs of improvement recently. In the second part of my speech, I will discuss how progress in financial regulation and supervision can also benefit financial integration in Europe, in addition to making the financial system more resilient. I will also argue that a less volatile cross-border source of finance, and hence a different quality of financial integration, could have avoided the considerable decline in the degree of financial integration during the crisis. For instance, a more integrated retail banking system could have mitigated the sudden stops in cross-border funding flows during the crisis, and could have enhanced risk sharing when it was most needed. The building blocks of the banking union could potentially not only reverse the trend of financial “de-integration” in the euro area but also increase the quality of integration. I will finally suggest that, in addition to bank funding, arm’s length financing through capital markets will have a stabilising role. 1. Integration vs. convergence, and rationales for broad financial integration in Europe Before commenting on current developments, let me first explain what I understand by financial integration, and how integration is different from mere convergence in asset prices or yields. In the Eurosystem, we define financial integration as a situation whereby there are no frictions that discriminate between economic agents in their access to – and their investment of – capital, particularly on the basis of their location. This means that financial integration is achieved when there is equal market access, de facto and de jure. In such a setting one would also expect to see significant cross-border holdings of financial assets, along with a convergence of asset prices and yields across borders. The latter follows from the law of one price, provided that these assets have similar cash flows and are affected by similar risk factors. This means that, when we observe a differentiation of yields across borders, this observation, in itself, is not sufficient evidence of market fragmentation. It may just mean that markets are pricing different risks. Similarly, different interest rates on loans to 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches SMEs located in different countries can reflect different productivities.1 Conversely, the well-known convergence of sovereign yields across countries in the euro area to very low levels before the financial crisis did not, in itself, imply market integration. The bottom line is that convergence of prices does not necessarily mean integration; it is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. In my discussion today, I will therefore refer both to price-based indicators and quantity-based indicators of cross-border holdings. Surely, most economists would agree that international financial integration is by and large beneficial.2 This is for several reasons. First, stable, integrated and adequately supervised markets facilitate an efficient allocation of resources both over time and across national borders, enabling investors to fund profitable investment opportunities whenever and wherever they arise. Second, financial integration allows the inter-temporal smoothing of consumption in response to occasional income shocks, and the diversification of households’ financial assets, protecting their revenue against shocks to their labour income. This second reason is of special importance in a monetary union, where the stability of the single currency requires adequate risk-sharing mechanisms through goods, labour and capital markets. Third, a higher degree of financial integration enhances competition among financial institutions as well as among financial market infrastructures and reduces the costs of financial intermediation. While international financial integration is beneficial, it is vital in the case of the euro area. A highly integrated financial system is necessary to ensure that the impulses coming from our monetary policy diffuse homogeneously through financial markets across the euro area as a whole. The financial crisis made clear, however, that unchecked financial integration also poses risks to financial stability. It increases financial complexity, the risk of cross-border contagion and the risk of sudden stops in capital flows. These risks are particularly pronounced in the absence of a strong institutional framework.3 Such risks have been illustrated both internationally and within the euro area in the recent years of crisis. 2. Financial integration in Europe: salient facts and figures Let me now turn to financial integration in Europe. Overall, the degree of financial integration has progressively increased in the euro area since the introduction of the euro. However, the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010 and the subsequent euro area sovereign debt crisis reversed this trend to some degree.4 For the reason I gave earlier, these developments have been particularly problematic for the Eurosystem. I will refer to these developments when discussing the effects that the banking union should have on more and better financial integration. Let me show you some indicators.                                                  1 See G. Moëc (2013), “The trouble with SMEs – no quick fix”, Deutsche Bank research note, 8 March. 2 In non-OECD countries, the welfare gains of international capital mobility are however found to be much smaller than those of a take-off in domestic productivity, see P.O. Gourinchas (2006), “The Elusive Gains from International Financial Integration”, Review of Economic Studies, 73(3), 715–741. 3 See Fecht, F., Grüner, H. P, and P. Hartmann (2007), “Welfare Effects of Financial Integration”, CEPR discussion paper No. 6311, 1–35, and Fecht, F., Grüner, H. P., and P. Hartmann (2012), “Financial integration, Specialization, and Systemic Risk”, Journal of International Economics, Vol. 88(1), 150–165. 4 See the ECB’s Financial Integration Report (2012). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  An integrated money market is important to ensure a balanced transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy stance. It is also the market segment in which the financial crisis first began in August 2007. The money market has become increasingly impaired, especially across borders. The standard deviation of EURIBOR rates across countries within the euro area has moved consistently above the corresponding standard deviation within domestic borders. This is a sign that market participants are demanding an extra premium to lend to counterparties located in other countries. This premium rises when market conditions are tense. During the crisis, this was the case for both one-month rates and 12-month rates. As a consequence of the interbank market stress, the ECB had to step up its intermediation role, reacting with non-standard monetary policy measures, such as a fixed-rate full-allotment liquidity policy.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches There is a similar phenomenon in the overnight unsecured money market and the secured money market. The latter is usually more resilient in times of crisis. A significant rise in price differentiation in repo markets has occurred as market participants have increasingly taken “correlation risks” into account: the pricing of risk has become much more dependent on the geographic origin of both the counterparty and the collateral, in particular when these are from the same country. An additional sign of risk aversion is that market participants have shifted from the unsecured to the secured market.  Let me now address cross-border lending by banks. Looking at price-based indicators, we see two different phases; first, until 2007, a gradual convergence across countries of the rates that banks charged for new loans to non-financial corporations. And then, from 2008 onwards, a considerable reversal of that trend. Cross-sectional variation is particularly pronounced for smaller loans up to €1 million. Of course, higher credit risk in lending to firms from some countries in recession explains some of the observed cross-country variation, and higher rates on smaller loans may also be an indication of higher risk and of the agency cost of monitoring smaller projects. Quantity-based indicators point to a relatively slower pace of financial integration in the retail banking sector before the crisis. Overall, outstanding cross-border loans to the non-financial sector in other euro area countries increased by only a few percentage points over the last decade. For sure, the process of financial integration in retail banking – though steady and significant – was particularly slow. On the positive side, the reversal of that trend during the crisis has also been more muted than in other market segments. The evidence points towards a slow erosion of the earlier slow progress toward financial integration.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  In 2010, at the outset of the sovereign debt crisis, only three relatively small countries were strongly affected. Later on, however, the bond yields of larger countries also came under pressure. A stark differentiation across sovereign bond yields is clearly visible from the chart. Does such stark differentiation imply market fragmentation, or are markets merely pricing different quantities of risk? To answer that question, it helps to get a complementary perspective from quantity-based indicators. Cross-border holdings of government bonds by euro area monetary and financial institutions, as a ratio to their total holdings of securities, have been on a declining trend since 2006. The ratio has now returned to the levels observed before the beginning of the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union. The reason for the initial decline in 2006 in the share of government bond holdings was portfolio reallocation to corporate bonds and probably to international assets as well. The decline later on during the crisis was most likely due to an increased propensity of banks to hold domestic government bonds. This is problematic, because it reflects an increased risk link between the sovereign and the domestic banking system. We also see that European investment funds held less European debt as the debt crisis intensified. The renationalisation of government bond holdings and, more generally, of safe financial assets is also reflected in the Eurosystem collateral that is posted by the Eurosystem’s counterparties. Counterparties increasingly tend to post collateral from their home country. This creates the risk of negative feedback loops at country level, with a higher perceived credit risk causing a drop in asset valuation and strains in the funding of local banks. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches    Allow me to summarise the discussion so far. We have seen pronounced financial de-integration in the interbank market, in cross-border banking activity, and a renationalisation of bond holdings during the crisis. All of these developments are problematic from the perspective of the Eurosystem, not the least because they exhibit strong pro-cyclical features at local level in euro area countries. Once unleashed, financial de-integration can be self-reinforcing. If left to its own devices, as we saw in the first half of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 2012, de-integration can lead to expectations of disintegration – a euro break-up, which the ECB had to counteract by announcing the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs). There have been signs of receding financial fragmentation since the summer of 2012, following the announcement of OMTs, visible signs of adjustment in euro area economies and government commitments to a stronger euro area governance. This can be seen in a number of important market segments. The median absolute deviation of the spread between the ten-year government bond yield and the corresponding swap spread declined by about one-third between July 2012 and February 2013. Euro area banks received a cumulated €164 billion capital inflow from non-euro area investors between August 2012 and end-January 2013, in sharp contrast with the €21 billion cumulated outflow between January and July 2012. As a rough measure of the fragmentation of bank funding markets across the euro area, Target2 balances have declined by about €200 billion since their peak in mid-2012. To give but one example, the Target2 balance of the Banco de España has declined by about one-quarter since August 2012. On the lending side, the dispersion of lending rates to non-financial corporations (NFCs) also declined, but by considerably less than the dispersion of monetary financial institutions’ (MFI) funding rates. For example, the median absolute deviation of NFC lending rates has fallen from 5.6% in the first seven months of 2012 to 4.4% since then. This provides ample evidence of receding financial fragmentation. But there is no room for complacency, as the overall level of fragmentation remains high, and the disconnect between the dispersion of MFI funding and lending rates reveals a persistent difficulty in monetary policy transmission. During the financial crisis, it also became painfully apparent that cross-border capital flows are subject to sudden stops, in particular in the interbank market. As soon as counterparty risk emerged, banks became reluctant to lend one to another. Sudden stops would not have materialised in that extreme way if integration had occurred in different market segments that are less sensitive to information and counterparty credit risk.5 In particular, cross-border retail banking was relatively limited before the crisis, both in terms of extending credit lines through bank branches, and in terms of building cross-border bank-client relationships. Had such retail banking activity been more spread out, banks would have found it more difficult to suddenly withdraw funding from jurisdictions under stress. As a consequence, there would have been less retrenchment to national jurisdictions, a higher degree of risk sharing during times of crisis, and hence a lesser need for the Eurosystem to take an intermediation role. 3. The banking union and what it can do for financial integration In the second part of my speech, I would like to assess how to invert the trend of financial de-integration. I will argue that the banking union will help us move towards an environment of more and better financial integration. It is clear to us that a strong and independent supranational supervisor will contribute significantly to the smooth functioning of the monetary union and to restoring confidence in the banking sector. Regaining such confidence, in turn, is also key to reversing financial fragmentation and restarting fully functioning cross-border markets. The main objective of the banking union is to build an integrated framework that safeguards financial stability and minimises the cost of bank failures. Indeed, the banking union, together with the new regulatory standards, will help to mitigate the financial stability risks which arise when markets become more integrated and which the previous regulatory and supervisory framework failed to avert in the period leading to the crisis. A complete banking union requires four building blocks.                                                  5 See, for example, F. Heider, M. Hoerova, and C. Holthausen (2009), “Liquidity hoarding and interbank market spreads: The role of counterparty risk”, ECB Working Paper, 1126. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches The first building block is the establishment of a single rulebook. Such a single rulebook now exists with the agreement reached on the Capital Requirements Directive IV. The single rulebook sets guidelines for capital, liquidity and compensation policies, and contributes significantly to creating a level playing field for financial institutions across borders. Second, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will enforce supervision consistently across the participating Member States. The SSM will be a mechanism composed of national competent authorities and the ECB, with the possibility of non-euro area Member States also taking part. The process of establishing the SSM is under way, with the Council’s proposal forming the basis for the current discussion at the European Parliament. A third element of the banking union will be the establishment of a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and a Single Resolution Authority (SRA). The Single Resolution Mechanism would build on the harmonised resolution framework, as provided for in the draft Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive, and on the existence of a single resolution fund financed by the industry. It would enable prompt and coordinated resolution action, specifically where cross-border banks are concerned. For there to be a complete banking union there has to be a credible fiscal backstop. Any call on this backstop should be compensated ex post by levies on the financial industry. Indeed, the SRM is not about bailing out banks with public money. Instead, it is about minimising the use of public money. A credible backstop will be very important in respect of one goal of the banking union project in particular: mitigating the negative feedback loop between banks and sovereigns. Looking further ahead, the fourth element of the banking union should be the establishment of a common system of deposit protection. This framework should enable the national deposit guarantee schemes, built on common EU standards, to interact with the SRM. A European deposit guarantee will undoubtedly be important in the future to ensure depositor confidence in the robustness of all European banks. I see at least four main ways in which the European banking union, when fully implemented, can support broad and stable financial integration in Europe. First, achieving both financial stability and financial market integration may not be possible under national financial policies, or at least much more difficult. This is the so-called “financial trilemma” of Schoenmaker (2011),6 which states that policy-makers can only choose two out of the following three objectives: financial stability, financial integration and national financial policies, such as bank supervision and resolution. One of these has to give way. National financial policies fail to recognise the externality generated by cross-border banks in difficulty. As a result, they generate under-provision of supervision, then of capital for troubled banks with a cross-border and/or systemic component. In addition, national supervisors may more easily be subject to regulatory capture. Both facts undermine financial stability. By setting the incentives correctly, a fully-fledged banking union permits an internalisation of this externality, making sure that banks strengthen their capital and liquidity on sunny days and can continue to lend on rainy days. Second, the Single Supervisory Mechanism can address cross-border externalities typically neglected by national supervisors and thus contribute to reversing the retrenchment and market fragmentation. Since the start of the sovereign crisis, countries with sound fundamentals have been accumulating savings rather than channelling funds to countries under stress through inter-bank or intra-bank capital markets. During crises, supervisors acting within their national mandates may encourage domestic banks with subsidiaries abroad to repatriate capital and liquidity, if a subsidiary is located in a country under stress. Conversely, they may encourage the domestic subsidiaries of foreign banks not to send                                                  6 See D. Schoenmaker (2011), “The Financial Trilemma”, Economic Letters, Vol. 111 (1). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 funds to their parent banks located in countries with high-risk premia.7 In the context of a strictly national supervisory system, this is rational behaviour, given that the objective of the national supervisory authorities is the stability of the domestic financial system. That does not mean it is an optimal behaviour, as it is not conducive to the stability of the euro area system as a whole and ignores the possibility of adverse feedback from instability elsewhere. An authority acting within a European mandate, however, would not penalise cross-border lending in that way, leading to less financial retrenchment and renationalisation of funding. Third, the financial crisis has shown that sovereign credit risk and the health of the financial system are closely related. In some countries, weak sovereign finances have fed into the domestic financial system, while in others the reverse has been the case. The introduction of a Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism will help to break this deadly embrace. Severing the risk link between the sovereign and its banking system is key to maintaining financial integration in times of crisis, to limiting pro-cyclicality and to counteracting the re-nationalisation of bond holdings. Fourth, large banks that grow bigger and expand across borders could also be inclined to take on more risk, due to the moral hazard ensuing from the “too-big-to-fail” issue. The possibility of being resolved – which may not be perceived as credible at national level, but which may be possible at supranational level within the SRM – would contribute to containing such moral hazard, and hence in addition decrease the risk of an adverse loop between sovereign debt and the banking system. Together with the special treatment of systemically important financial institutions in the new regulatory framework, the Single Resolution Authority and the Single Resolution Mechanism are therefore important when it comes to containing the contagion risk and systemic risk that naturally increases within a more integrated banking system. Finally, further development of cross-border retail lending prompted by the banking union would reduce vulnerability to sudden stops in wholesale funding markets. The creation of truly pan-European banks should be driven by business decisions, but it will be encouraged by the establishment of the single rulebook and of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and later on, of a common system of deposit protection. It should then be accepted that the location of banking activities within the euro area will be determined only on the basis of efficiency arguments, not of industrial policy. Then, and only then, will the link between banks and sovereigns be irreversibly severed. 4. The need for a balanced financing mix My remarks have so far addressed the re-integration of bank lending flows. While re-starting integrated inter-bank and intra-bank capital markets is clearly indispensable, significant financial intermediation does not occur through traditional financial institutions. The role of arm’s length finance, i.e. intermediation through financial markets, is not to be neglected, and the integration of the respective markets matters. Let me give two examples. First, a more integrated European market for corporate bonds may help firms to raise financing when banks are in deleveraging mode. Indeed, recent evidence from the euro area and the US suggests that corporate bond financing was an important substitute for bank financing during the financial crisis, when banks were unwilling or unable to lend,8 but such substitution has not been operating uniformly in all countries. The development and                                                  7 See D. Gros (2012), “The Single European Market in banking in decline – ECB to the rescue?”, in Banking union for Europe: Risk and Challenges, VoxEU.org, 12 April 2012. 8 See F. De Fiore and H. Uhlig (2011), “Bank finance versus bond finance”, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 43(7), 1399–1421, and Adrian, Colla, and Shin (2012), “Which financial frictions? Parsing the evidence of the financial crisis of 2007–09”, in NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2012. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches interconnection of European corporate bond markets is particularly beneficial from this perspective. Second, equity financing across borders, such as FDI flows and equity portfolio investment, is generally considered to be, relatively speaking, a more stable source of financing.9 The experience of the crisis has cast serious doubt on the role of debt as a solution to moral hazard. The value of equity is sensitive to the underlying quality of assets, whereas debt is only sensitive to the risk of bankruptcy. Equity holders balance upside and downside risk equally and equity can therefore be fairly priced even in an environment where little is known about the risk of firms,10 and where company risk and country risk prove difficult to disentangle. In addition, cross-border flows of short-term debt are not always conducive to efficient risk sharing and have a greater destabilising potential than equity flows.11 Finally, given the critical need to elevate their growth potential, euro area countries crucially need to promote innovation and the entry of new participants into markets, which can be supported by financial instruments such as venture capital.12 A more integrated market for equity financing would support rebalancing and growth in euro area economies. What I am suggesting is not that Europe should abandon its intermediated model of financing but that it complements it more – in the context of a structural deleveraging of the banking system – with alternative sources of finance. The financing of SMEs, which will be at the heart of Europe’s effort to increase its productivity, because they are a source of innovation, can be usefully supported by a more vibrant securitisation market. Still, SME financing will continue to crucially rely on bank lending. Europe needs a healthy, competitive and prudent banking sector. Therefore, banks should continue to adjust their balance sheets and strengthen their capital to recreate a capacity to take risk and lend to companies and households, within and beyond national borders. Removing credit risk from the banks’ balance sheet, as was done at an early stage in the US, can speed up this process – provided that governments are willing and able to take this risk, individually or jointly. Let me raise a final point. A better quality of financial integration would also mean providing a framework in which cross-border capital flows go towards their most productive uses. This has not always been the case in the euro area. Since the introduction of the euro, we have seen euro area capital flows go from “healthier” (core) countries to “weaker” (or poorer, peripheral) countries. This is superficially in line with what economic theory would suggest: capital flows go from richer to poorer countries, where it earns a higher return owing to lower levels of capital per worker. Indeed, capital was flowing “downhill”, and there is no “Lucas paradox” in the euro area as there is in the global economy.13 However, in many instances, capital flows went into the very inappropriate sectors, fuelling asset or housing price bubbles instead of going to more productive uses. It is my hope, at least, that improved financial supervision, in particular supervision with a macro-prudential and systemic focus, together                                                  9 See Hausmann, R., and E.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 11 with a stringent enforcement of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure,14 can help to alleviate such cross-border misallocations in the future. 5. Conclusion Let me conclude. Although still preliminary, the recent signs of financial re-integration across several financial market segments have the potential to be self-reinforcing and unleash virtuous dynamics. The creation of a fully-fledged banking union can set incentives for more and better financial integration, in a way that will make the euro area banking sector less vulnerable to fragmentation along national borders and reduce pro-cyclicality in euro area economies. On top of being conducive to a more stable financial system, it will thereby be conducive to a more efficient allocation of resources. For once, there is no trade-off between efficiency and stability.                                                   14 See online: European Commission > Economic and Financial Affairs > EU economic governance > Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ravi Menon: Singapore’s financial centre in the new landscape Keynote address by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the Investment Management Association of Singapore’s (IMAS) 14th Annual Conference, Singapore, 13 March 2013. *      *      * Mr Lester Gray, Chairman of IMAS, Distinguished speakers, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. A new financial landscape Four years since Lehman Brothers collapsed, a new financial landscape is emerging. While the contours of this new landscape are still forming, three driving forces are discernible: financial deleveraging, regulatory reforms, and the rise of Asia Driving forces First, the global financial industry is deleveraging. Banks around the world are consolidating their balance sheets and tightening underwriting standards, even forgoing certain types of lending altogether. Many have resorted to shedding assets, especially assets in those countries where the banks do not enjoy a large market share. • According to BIS data, globally, banks’ foreign claims fell by about 15% from early 2008 to 2012. • For European banks, the decline was twice as steep, at about 30%. Second, the global financial crisis has spurred financial regulatory reforms on a scale that we have never seen before. • Basel III will raise the quantity and quality of capital that banks must hold, increase the liquidity buffers they must keep, and limit the amount of leverage they can take on. • Solvency II will raise requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for European insurance companies, and shape the development of risk-based capital frameworks for insurers in other jurisdictions. • New capital markets regulation will transform the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading business, with mandatory reporting, central clearing, and margin requirements for non-centrally-cleared contracts. • Additional capital charges and closer supervisory intensity will be applied on the so-called G-SIBs, or global systemically important banks, as part of efforts to address the “too-big-to-fail” problem. Some regulatory initiatives will impinge directly on the structure of financial institutions. Many jurisdictions are pushing for local incorporation of institutions, especially if they are systemically important. In America and Europe, regulators are reviewing various proposals for separating or insulating retail banking from riskier activities. Third, the centre of gravity of financial activity is shifting towards Asia. • The IMF forecasts that, in the next five years, emerging Asia will grow by about 7% per annum, nearly three times faster than the 2.5% forecast for the advanced economies. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The financing needs of companies and individuals in Asia will grow in tandem. Infrastructure investment needs alone will amount to a staggering 8 trillion US Dollars over the next decade. There is opportunity to mobilise Asia’s large pool of savings to meet these financing needs. But this transmission is not working as well as it should, because financial markets in Asia are still under-developed and fragmented. The region remains heavily reliant on bank lending, and capital markets are not deep enough. • According to McKinsey, bank loans were more than a third of Asian banking and capital markets, compared to just 10% in the US. • Debt capital markets are particularly under-represented, contributing only 20–30% of financing in Asia, compared to 65% in the US and 55% in Europe. A “new normal” in global finance? How will the global financial landscape change in response to these three driving forces? It will be hard to say but let me hazard some guesses. First, if the reforms are well implemented, we should see a material reduction of risk in the financial sector and improved financial stability. I do not think we will see an end to financial crises as such, but financial systems should become more resilient. This, in and of itself, will enhance economic welfare substantially. Second, financial institutions will be forced to rationalise their business models and streamline their operations to better optimise capital, reduce compliance costs, and enhance efficiency. Third, global financial institutions will expand their Asian footprint. They will establish more Asia-focused teams and functions. Many of these firms will make a second home in Asia. But Asia is a diverse and non-homogenous market. Global financial institutions will hub in more than one location. The structure of global banks is likely to change significantly. Banks’ profits and return on equity will come under pressure. The risk-return profiles of virtually all banking products will be re-ordered. The new liquidity rules will make deposits a strategic source of funding. Retail banking stands a good chance of reclaiming its role as the bedrock of banking. Insurance companies, facing higher capital requirements and ageing demographics, will be under pressure to boost returns on investment and enhance asset-liability management. Many of them will be motivated to access new and under-penetrated markets, and seek higher yielding investments within the constraints of regulations and their mandates. Exchanges will continue to consolidate and adopt a “multi-asset class” approach. Companies will explore other avenues for raising capital, including private placements. There will be more standardised derivative products and new types of market infrastructure: central counterparties for clearing, trade repositories for reporting, and swap execution facilities for trading. High-volume, low-margin platforms will likely become more competitive. A big unknown is the future of long-term finance. • First, banks are likely to play a reduced role in providing long-term financing, especially for infrastructure. Basel III will raise the cost of issuing long-term corporate and project finance loans above the cost of issuing mortgages and short-term loans. • Second, insurance companies may be discouraged from investing in long term assets, as a possible consequence of Solvency II. • Third, institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments often face restrictions on portfolio allocation that discourage them from providing long-term financing. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  • Fourth, the range of instruments that allow long-term investment is limited: in many countries, bond, equity and securitisation markets that provide alternative avenues for long-term finance are underdeveloped. If finance is to play its role as an enabler of economic growth, it will be important to develop new avenues for long-term funding. Singapore’s value proposition as a financial centre MAS has been closely studying these trends in global finance and finetuning its strategies to develop Singapore as a premier financial centre. The emerging financial landscape plays to Singapore’s strengths. Singapore’s value proposition in this new landscape rests on four pillars: • smart regulation; • diverse ecosystem; • pan-Asian focus; and • deep talent pool. I will take stock of Singapore’s strengths in each of these four areas and outline how we have refreshed our strategies and approaches. Smart regulation First, smart regulation. Since the global financial crisis, a higher premium has been placed on well-regulated financial centres like Singapore, which set high standards but implement them in a way that makes business sense. MAS has always required banks to meet high prudential standards, exceeding international norms in several areas. During the global financial crisis, this ensured that adequate safeguards were in place and confidence sustained. Post-crisis, our banks are well-placed to meet the new global capital and liquidity standards. Maintaining high standards is compatible with fostering a vibrant financial centre. They provide confidence for financial institutions and customers to do business here. MAS pays close attention to the design of financial regulation to ensure that they are risk-based and not more burdensome than necessary to meet regulatory objectives. • An example is the Financial Holding Companies (FHCs) Bill that is currently before Parliament. • MAS will not regulate all FHCs. The Bill will give MAS the flexibility on whether or not to regulate a particular FHC, taking into consideration, for instance, whether the FHC’s subsidiaries are important to Singapore’s financial system. MAS consults the industry and other stakeholders when introducing significant new regulation. The exception of course is where the issue is market sensitive. We consult at an early stage on the broad policy proposals as well as in the later stages of detailed rule-making. We carefully consider all feedback on the impact of new regulation and implementation issues, and adjust the proposals where appropriate. This helps MAS to calibrate the rules in a way that is appropriate for our market. • Take for example, the recent proposed changes to the regulatory capital framework for holders of capital markets services licenses. MAS briefed the industry, consulted extensively, and conducted quantitative impact studies. • In response to feedback, MAS has decided to provide a longer transition period of two years for industry to comply with the new rules. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • MAS will also revise its calibration of the operational risk capital charge. • Final details of the regulatory capital framework will be announced by June this year. Diverse ecosystem The second pillar: Singapore has a diverse financial ecosystem. The various parts of the financial sector not only serve important functions in their own right, but are mutually reinforcing. • The World Economic Forum has ranked Singapore 2nd worldwide for financial market development – a testament to the depth and breadth of Singapore’s financial sector. A full-fledged financial centre Singapore provides a broad and integrated suite of financial services. We are an important regional funding centre. • The Asian Dollar Market, with its total asset size of more than 1 trillion US dollars, has played a key role in serving the financing and treasury needs of individuals, corporates, and institutions in Singapore and the region. We are the premier asset management centre in Asia, acting as gateway to the world for Asian investors and for the world to tap Asian investments. • Assets under management by Singapore-based managers have more than quadrupled over the last decade to reach 1 trillion US dollars in 2011. We are the leading insurance centre in Asia. • Singapore plays host to about 190 insurance institutions meeting the protection needs of the economy and society across the region. • The industry has built up expertise in complex and specialist risks – including marine, energy, aviation and credit and political risks. We have one of the most developed bond markets in Asia. • Singapore’s total market capitalisation has grown by over 150% in the last decade, to 270 billion US dollars in 2011. We are the fourth largest foreign exchange trading centre in the world. • FX and FX derivatives turnover in Singapore has more than tripled in the last decade, with an average daily traded volume of about 360 billion US dollars. We are Asia’s leading commodity derivatives trading hub. • Most of the major global banks have their regional hubs in Singapore. • According to some estimates, Singapore accounts for more than half of Asia’s OTC commodity derivatives trades. To succeed in the new financial landscape, Singapore must comprehensively support Asia’s long-term financing needs. Let me highlight two strategic areas where we will harness our diverse financial ecosystem: debt capital market and infrastructure financing. Debt capital market In a world of deleveraging and higher regulatory constraints on banks, it is now more urgent than ever to develop strong capital markets to complement bank lending and help to provide a better match for longer term funding requirements. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The fundamentals for a strong debt capital market are in place. • The Singapore bond market is fully accessible to all issuers and investors globally with no capital controls, hedging restrictions, or withholding taxes. • There is diversity of issuers – financial institutions, corporations and government agencies. • There is variety in instruments issued, including structured and securitised debt. Last year, I announced three initiatives to further improve the efficiency and liquidity of the Singapore Dollar bond markets. We have made good progress since. The provision of swap liquidity to primary dealer banks handling Singapore Dollar debt issuance for corporations is fully operational. MAS is now able to support swap transactions at market-determined rates. The Singapore Dollar corporate bond securities lending facility will become operational by June this year. The facility will provide market makers an avenue to borrow securities and make prices more freely. The price discovery initiative to provide end-of-day prices for Singapore Dollar corporate bonds was completed in June last year. This price transparency has already spurred industry-led efforts to create a Singapore Dollar corporate bond index which market participants could use as a benchmark for investment management. MAS supports these efforts. Infrastructure finance A relatively new thrust in our financial sector strategy is infrastructure finance. Infrastructure is a sector ripe with opportunity. However, private sector participation has so far been muted due to the shortage of “bankable” projects and risks that the private sector alone is not equipped to mitigate. The financing gap will be compounded by new regulations restricting bank lending, which is still the primary form of infrastructure financing in Asia. Singapore is working in partnership with a diverse group of stakeholders, to help address these challenges. • We are working with the World Bank to identify and develop bankable projects in Asia. The World Bank’s investment arm, the IFC, will be setting up in Singapore its first Asset Management Company office outside Washington DC, to co-invest in regional infrastructure projects. • Last year, Temasek Holdings partnered Singapore-based banks to establish Clifford Capital, which aims to plug financing gaps faced by Singapore-based companies involved in long-tenor, cross-border infrastructure projects. • MAS is exploring with industry players how capital market solutions can encourage investor interest through project bonds, infrastructure debt funds, and project loan securitisation. Pan-Asian focus A third pillar of Singapore’s value proposition as a financial centre is its pan-Asian focus. With strong links to all the key Asian economies, Singapore is a natural gateway for international firms looking to access Asia, and for Asian businesses to access the world. There are three new areas of opportunity that play to Singapore’s pan-Asian focus: ASEAN connectivity, OTC derivatives infrastructure, and offshore RMB business. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  ASEAN connectivity First, ASEAN connectivity. Singapore, in partnership with our ASEAN neighbours, is actively pursuing greater harmonisation and integration across the region’s financial markets. • We are trying to harmonise rules and regulations and develop integrated trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure. • For example, ASEAN regulators are currently working on a framework to facilitate cross-border offerings of collective investment schemes. This initiative aims to promote greater flow of capital across the region and enhance investor choice. • The stock exchanges of Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have linked up through a common trading platform, the ASEAN Trading Link. This platform provides investors a single entry-point access to the three largest equity markets in ASEAN. There is still some way to go to achieve seamless participation across the region’s financial markets. But these initiatives are a good start. OTC derivatives infrastructure Second, OTC derivatives infrastructure. Earlier, I spoke of global regulatory reforms driving a revolution in the derivatives market. This has brought about new market infrastructure developments, and Singapore has made significant strides in two key areas. The first area is clearing. • SGX AsiaClear, Asia’s first OTC clearing facility, was established as early as 2006. • As counterparty to both buyers and sellers, AsiaClear mitigates counterparty credit risk in OTC transactions. • AsiaClear’s value to the trading community extends to record and statement services, position netting, and cost savings for customers posting margins. • Today, SGX AsiaClear is the region’s leading multi-asset OTC clearing house, with volumes exceeding 300 billion US dollars to-date. The second area is trade reporting. • Just in December 2012, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) Global Trade Repository established its Asia-Pacific global data centre in Singapore. • The Singapore location is part of its global trio of data centres, designed to support DTCC’s global trade repository services around the clock. • DTCC’s initiative will fill a key post-trade market infrastructure gap in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region. • The industry will benefit from reduced connectivity costs and the greater convenience of reporting to a Singapore-based infrastructure. These developments not only align us with global regulatory reforms, they allow us to strengthen our role as a derivatives and risk management hub in Asia. Offshore RMB The third area of opportunity that plays to Singapore’s pan-Asian strength is offshore RMB business. The RMB’s role in facilitating intra-regional trade and investment will only grow in the coming years. Singapore is in a strong position to facilitate greater RMB-denominated trade and investment in the ASEAN region. We are deepening liquidity, establishing key infrastructure, and working with industry to expand the range of RMB products and services in Singapore. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  • In February this year, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s Singapore branch was designated Singapore’s RMB clearing bank. • Just five days ago, MAS and the People’s Bank of China signed an enhanced bilateral currency swap agreement. This will enable MAS to provide RMB liquidity to banks in Singapore where needed. Deep talent pool The fourth and final pillar supporting Singapore’s financial centre is our deep talent pool. Over the years, we have invested heavily in building up the competencies of our financial sector workforce, providing training grants across a broad range of programmes under the Financial Sector Development Fund (FSDF). Perhaps the most important of these programmes is the Financial Industry Competency Standards (FICS), a structured competency framework that is job-specific and practice-oriented. Looking ahead, to foster and sustain a strong financial sector workforce, MAS will take a dual approach. We will groom a first-rate Singaporean talent base, while continuing to secure highly-skilled global professionals. MAS is stepping up efforts to build a strong core of Singaporean specialists and leaders in finance. We are working with the major financial institutions here, on several fronts: • to nurture young Singaporeans at the entry level with opportunities to be mentored by senior leaders and to broaden their horizons across various functional roles; • to give Singaporeans the opportunity to deepen specialist skills by expanding our Finance Scholarship Programme; and • to help mid-career Singaporeans take on international postings that will help prepare them for leadership positions. At the same time, to stay relevant in the more complex financial landscape of tomorrow, Singapore must remain open to diverse talent and expertise. The financial sector offers Singaporeans great opportunity for well-paying, high value-added jobs. We need to ensure entrants to the sector have the necessary foundational skills and incumbents keep their skills relevant and updated through continuous professional development. The Institute of Banking and Finance will be sharpening the FICS programme to support this. Conclusion Let me conclude. The global financial industry is undergoing great change. What kind of financial centre do we want to be? If I had to choose three words, I would say robust, trusted, and purposeful • robust, in the sense of building resilience against shocks and managing risks prudently; • trusted, in the sense of staying clean and imbibing a culture of fair dealing with all stakeholders; and • purposeful, in the sense of generating real value, creating opportunities for people, and serving the economic needs of Singapore and the region. This vision cannot be realised by MAS alone. It is through active partnership with the industry and associations like IMAS, that we can make this happen – Singapore as a premier financial centre in the emerging landscape of tomorrow. I wish you all a fruitful conference. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Timothy Lane: Shedding light on shadow banking Remarks by Mr Timothy Lane, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the CFA Society Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, 26 June 2013. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about shadow banking, which is an important area for financial system reform, both globally and in Canada. Shadow banking refers to a set of activities outside the formal banking system that carry out similar functions to those performed by banks. While the term “shadow banking” tends to suggest something secretive or illicit, I will argue that, on the whole, shadow banking serves a useful purpose. At the same time, the experience during the global financial crisis revealed that shadow banking has some important fragilities. I will talk about certain common threads in the reforms being developed at the international level to address these fragilities and their relevance to Canada. How does shadow banking work? Shadow banking comprises activities involving some element of maturity and liquidity transformation, credit extension, and risk transfer, conducted partly or wholly outside the “traditional” banking system. It covers a wide range of activities, including securitization, repos, and money market funds (MMFS) as well as some activities of non-bank financial institutions such as finance companies and credit hedge funds. Different investors have different time horizons and different degrees of tolerance for illiquidity and risk. Investors seeking safe places to park their cash holdings typically prefer to hold assets that are of short maturity and liquid. The economy benefits from the existence of safe assets – assets that can be accepted without constantly having to scrutinize the issuer’s financial statements.1 At the same time, many of the productive long-term investments in the economy – investments that are essential to build its productive potential – are inherently illiquid, long-term, and risky. As a result, there is a clear role for institutions – either banks or shadow banks – to issue liabilities that are shorter-term, liquid and safe while holding longer-maturity, less liquid and/or risky assets. At the same time, this role brings with it intrinsic risks, as seen by bank runs and failures throughout the history of banking. Such risks are also illustrated by the implosion of some shadow banking activities – such as the collapse of asset-backed commercial paper and runs on repos and MMFs – during the global financial crisis. So how do you establish confidence that liabilities are safe and liquid? Banks have a number of features that help them establish confidence. Traditionally, they seek to build and maintain reputations for safety and soundness, in part to earn profits based on those reputations. They typically engage in a broad range of activities, both to diversify their risks and to pursue such profit opportunities. The scope of their activities in many cases makes banks highly interconnected with the rest of the financial system.                                                 1  A paper by G. Gorton, S. Lewellen, and A. Metrick, “The Safe-Asset Share,” American Economic Review 102 (3)(2012): 101–106, discusses the economic role of safe assets – characterized as assets that are “informationally insensitive” – and shows that they have been stable as a share of total assets over a long historical period. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Banks also maintain confidence through their capital and liability structure. The capital invested by their shareholders is available to absorb losses. They hold liquid assets so that they can redeem deposits on demand. At the same time, since banks are highly leveraged, they have a strong incentive to manage the risks to which they are exposed, notably credit risk, including by collecting information about their borrowers and monitoring their behaviour. Strong banks have long been synonymous with high capitalization levels, conservative balance-sheet structures, and robust risk-management and lending standards. Despite these traditional features, banks are still subject to runs and failures, which carry enormous costs for the economy. From the Great Depression to the Great Recession, instances of banking failures have led to public policy initiatives to make banks safer. Central banks provide liquidity to banks that are solvent but have run short of liquid assets. Deposit insurance reduces the incentive for depositors to run on a bank in times of stress. These elements of the “safety net” are complemented by stringent regulation – requiring that banks have enough capital to absorb losses and enough liquid assets to meet plausible potential drains. In addition, bank supervisors scrutinize many aspects of their operations. Regulation and supervision are essential to maintain depositor confidence and to ensure that banks do not rely excessively on the safety net – thus limiting moral hazard. So what about shadow banking? Confidence in shadow banking is partly based on collateral. For example, investors hold asset-backed securities mainly on the strength of the underlying assets, rather than on the reputation of the issuer – which may be an anonymous special purpose vehicle created for the sole purpose of holding the assets and issuing securities. Similarly, investors provide cash in repo transactions because, even if the institution receiving the cash were to default, the institution providing the cash would have a claim on the underlying asset. In other cases, shadow banking assets are perceived to be safe because of the narrow range of activities in which they engage. For example, MMFs provide a close substitute for bank deposits, partly because they invest only in very liquid, short-term, low-risk securities. Other shadow banking institutions, such as credit hedge funds and finance companies, have structured their assets and liabilities in various ways to avoid being subject to runs. Thus, shadow banks have a variety of business models to maintain investors’ confidence and obtain access to financing. These models are different from those of regular banks, and from one another. So what is the advantage of shadow banking, given that banks already exist? For some forms of intermediation, shadow banking may be more efficient and provide healthy competition for traditional banks. Room on banks’ balance sheets is expensive, so avoiding the use of those balance sheets can save money and free up lending capacity. The regulations to which banks are subject may also give them less flexibility to serve some sectors of the market, or at least restrict their ability to offer those customers a competitive package. Where banks do not tread, shadow banking steps in to fill the gaps and make the financial system more efficient. A financial system with a diverse set of business models may be both more innovative and more resilient. And, given that banks are often highly interconnected, there may be an advantage, in the interest of financial stability, to transferring some risk outside of the banking system. In particular, by using market mechanisms to distribute and diversify this risk, it will end up being borne by those investors most willing to hold the risk. At the same time, shadow banking can be a form of regulatory arbitrage, circumventing the regulations to which banks are subject. Such behaviour can create distortions and additional risks to the system. As bank regulations are tightened, the incentives for such behaviour obviously increase. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  While banks and shadow banks have separate functions and activities, it is important to remember that their paths intersect. Shadow banking relies on traditional banks. Many forms of shadow banking, such as asset-backed commercial paper and related structured products, often require support from banks through liquidity lines to bring them to market. And banks in turn rely on shadow banking for funding, for example, through repo residential mortgage backed securities or covered bonds. What went wrong? The weaknesses of both traditional banking and shadow banking were clearly exposed during the global financial crisis: both proved vulnerable to run-like behaviour despite features intended to bolster confidence. A number of core funding markets froze up as financial institutions lost the confidence to lend to one another. The flight from counterparty risk reflected the vulnerabilities of many banks, as well as the fragility of the shadow banking system. I won’t dwell on the vulnerabilities of the banks and how they are being addressed, since that has been discussed in considerable detail elsewhere, but I will discuss some of the weaknesses exposed in global shadow banking. During the crisis, repo markets came under severe stress. Market makers and cash lenders became less able and willing to provide repo financing, and, as a result, some repo borrowers experienced difficulties financing even good-quality collateral. Borrowing limits were reduced, the terms of transactions shortened, haircuts on private securities accepted as collateral widened and the range of securities accepted as collateral narrowed down to all but the safest. The volume of repo transactions dropped off sharply. Such strains were experienced in Canada and around the world. Markets for various asset-backed securities collapsed. In the United States, markets for mortgage-backed securities and various other structured products essentially closed: issuance stopped, prices fell sharply, and perceptions of these securities’ safety were badly damaged. Canada experienced its own crisis in non-bank asset-backed commercial paper in mid-2007; only coordinated action by the public and private sectors prevented potentially catastrophic system-wide repercussions. Money market funds in the United States experienced substantial drains, as fears emerged that these funds would have to “break the buck.” The Federal Reserve introduced extraordinary liquidity facilities and the United States government provided temporary guarantees to halt a full-fledged run. These developments were similar to traditional bank runs – a general withdrawal of participation from certain markets for fear of counterparty risk. They also exposed the risks associated with the use of collateral as it became more difficult to value and dispose of in illiquid markets. We saw that as the system came under stress, market participants faced the prospect of unloading collateral at fire-sale prices – in many cases exposing institutions to “wrong-way” risks for which they were inadequately prepared.2 For similar reasons, margins on derivatives transactions and haircuts on collateral increased. These stresses in the shadow banking system amplified the stresses on the financial system more generally and transmitted them globally. Another underlying issue that surfaced was the misalignment of incentives. Here, a striking example is the case of mortgage-backed securities, structured products and the “originate to distribute” model. Since investors could not readily assess the quality of the assets backing                                                 2  “Wrong-way” risk refers to the risk that the value of collateral is more likely to decline under the same circumstances in which a counterparty is more likely to default. (In other words, collateral turns out to be insufficient precisely when it is needed most). 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  these securities, there was an incentive for originators to use, and over-issue, lower-quality assets, knowing that they would earn the origination fees, while the investors would bear the risk. Moreover, the complexity of some structured products obscured high levels of leverage, which exacerbated losses when the underlying asset values declined.3  The linkages between traditional banks and shadow banks meant that vulnerabilities spread. For example, when asset-backed securities came under pressure, the sponsoring banks faced significant drains through the credit and liquidity lines they had provided. In some cases, they ended up standing behind the asset-backed securities they had sponsored, largely to maintain their reputations, despite having no legal obligation to do so. At the same time, since shadow banking had become an important source of funding for the banks themselves, stresses in shadow banking had an impact on the banks: for example, when repo markets seized up, banks faced severe funding pressures. How to fix it? The experience of the crisis points to a need for reforms that will enable shadow banking to continue to play a useful role while addressing its inherent risks. The purpose here is not to stamp out all risk, but to ensure that risks are appropriately understood and managed. A related purpose is to prevent an increase in shadow banking activity driven solely by regulatory arbitrage in response to the tightening of regulations faced by banks. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has mapped out international work on shadow banking, identifying five work streams: links between banks and shadow banking; money market funds; other shadow banking organizations; securitization; and securities lending and repos. The FSB has also begun monitoring the evolution of the sector and the associated risks. To guide the key reforms, the FSB has established some basic principles. The regulatory measures should be: • focused, to target the risks that shadow banking creates; • proportionate to the risks to the financial system; • forward looking and adaptable to emerging risks and innovations; • effective, so that they balance the need for international consistency as well as jurisdictional differences; and, finally, • regularly assessed and reviewed following implementation, and improved as necessary. I would like to stress some common threads that run through the global reform agenda: reducing susceptibility to runs and liquidity freezes and better aligning incentives. Let me talk about how they apply to three shadow banking activities: repo markets, securitization and MMFs. With repo markets, a key element is to reduce vulnerability to the kind of concerns about counterparty risk that surfaced during the crisis. One important aspect of the reform discussion relates to how market participants set haircuts – the amount of collateral they require – on repo transactions. The focus on haircuts is a question of perception versus                                                 3  In the United States, during the pre-crisis period, securitization did not disperse risks to the extent that had been believed. In fact, it amplified the exposure of many institutions to a common shock linked to the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and may have increased interconnectedness within the financial system. The widespread use of credit ratings for these structured mortgage products gave investors a misleading sense of security because these ratings were primarily based on the idiosyncratic risks of the mortgages in the securitization pool, rather than on the systemic risk of a collapse in the U.S. housing market. The Financial Stability Board has since introduced principles to reduce reliance on ratings from credit-rating agencies. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  reality. It recognizes that when market conditions are good, with low volatility and low perceived levels of risk, the haircuts charged by market participants can fall below levels that might be considered prudent from a risk-management perspective. This can result from competitive pressures among financial institutions or because haircut methodologies place more weight on recent benign market movements. Declines in haircut levels increase the ability of market participants to obtain leverage, which in turn can fuel further increases in asset prices. When a shock hits, this cycle can quickly reverse as asset prices fall, volatility spikes, haircuts are raised and margin calls ensue.4  In light of this possibility, serious consideration is being given to enforcing minimum quality standards for the methodologies that market participants use to set collateral haircuts for repos. This could include imposing minimum numerical haircuts for certain types of more risky transactions.5  Now let me turn to securitization. Here, one of the priorities is to align the incentives of institutions that originate loans with those of investors. Proposals have focused on the need to ensure that the originators have “skin in the game,” by requiring them to retain a certain minimum share of the securities they sell, and to enhance transparency regarding the underlying assets. Proposals for the reform of MMFs focus on reducing their vulnerability to run-like behaviour. Like bank deposits, an MMF traditionally promises to redeem its shares at par, that is, at a constant net asset value. The MMF investors may thus have an incentive to run in a case where the assets may be insufficient to back up that claim – for instance, if there are concerns that the fund may have suffered serious credit losses on some assets. Various proposals to address that weakness are on the table: moving to variable net asset value; requiring a cushion of capital or imposing tighter requirements on the liquidity of the assets held by the MMF; establishing “gates” – i.e., restrictions on investors’ ability to withdraw their money at short notice; or a combination of these measures. The goal is to make MMFs less vulnerable to runs without ending their usefulness as a close substitute for bank deposits and an important source of short-term funding for a number of private and public sector borrowers. What does this mean for Canada? So far, I’ve been talking about shadow banking issues mainly from an international perspective. Now I would like to focus on how these issues apply here at home. In Canada, shadow banking is more limited in scale and scope than in other jurisdictions, especially the United States, where competitive pressures and regulatory restrictions drove some activities out of the banking system. Let’s look at some numbers. Shadow banking in Canada represents about 40 per cent of activity in the traditional banking sector, down from an average of about 50 per cent during the decade before 2008. As a share of GDP, Canadian shadow banking is roughly 40 per cent, compared with about 95 per cent in the United States.6                                                  4  Committee on the Global Financial System, 2010, “The Role of Margin Requirements and Haircuts in Procyclicality,” CGFS Publications No. 36. 5  Financial Stability Board, 2012, “Securities Lending and Repos: Market Overview and Financial Stability Issues,” Interim Report of the FSB Workstream on Securities Lending and Repos, 27 April. 6  See, T.

Lavoie, “Monitoring and Assessing Risks in Canada’s Shadow Banking Sector,” Bank of Canada Financial System Review (June 2013): 55–63.This is a measure of shadow banking activities, some of which are undertaken by banks and other regulated financial institutions. This is in contrast to entity-based measures reported by the FSB, which comprise only the assets of institutions outside the perimeter of prudential regulation. According to the FSB definition, assets of shadow banking entities in 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The composition of shadow banking is also different in Canada than elsewhere. One key element is repo markets, which are an important funding market for Canadian financial institutions. Although repo markets are based primarily on government securities involving little credit risk, and in most cases at least one of the counterparties is a regulated financial institution, during the crisis they experienced the kind of freezes that occurred in other countries. This experience is motivating the move toward central clearing of repos using the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service, which went live last year.7  A very important element of shadow banking in Canada is the securitization of government-guaranteed mortgages, which essentially converts illiquid assets – mortgages – into more liquid, securitized debt instruments. This form of securitization has more than doubled over the past five years.8 When mortgage lending is funded by issuing debt securities backed by insured mortgages, it moves mortgage lending away from its traditional on-balance-sheet model whereby mortgages are funded by branch-sourced, retail deposits. This represents a relatively low-cost form of term funding for financial institutions. Here, a key concern is the potential misallocation of resources away from non-mortgage lending toward mortgage credit – which, in the current economic environment, contributes to the buildup of imbalances in the household sector.9  Another aspect of the securitization of insured mortgages is the increasing role of specialized mortgage-lending institutions. These institutions are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as banks and in some instances don’t have access to as stable and diversified sources of funding. While their small size suggests that they do not pose systemic risk, they do involve elements of shadow banking risk that call for careful monitoring. Money-market funds make up a fairly small segment of shadow banking in Canada. At the end of 2012, Canadian MMFs had approximately $30 billion of assets under management, less than half of the peak level reached in 2009. Despite their small size, the risk of runs posed by MMFs still exists and must be managed carefully. Coming in from the shadows Recognizing both the benefits and the risks of the shadow banking sector, we need to continue working to make it safer. Internationally, we are working with our partners in the FSB to develop an integrated set of recommendations that will be presented at the G-20 meetings in St. Petersburg in September. The Canadian authorities will need to decide how to implement the reforms that are agreed at the global level. Some measures that could be considered include: • Establishing consistent standards for how haircuts are set on repo transactions, including numerical minimum haircuts for some types of transactions; • Requiring that originating securitized products have enough skin in the game to align their incentives better with those of investors;                                                                                                                                                    Canada were 28 percent of GDP in 2011. The measure of traditional bank liabilities consists of gross deposits (including longer-term Canadian-dollar unsecured debt), subordinated debt and the foreign currency deposits of Canadian residents. 7  A. Côté. 2013. “Toward a Stronger Financial Market Infrastructure for Canada: Taking Stock.” (speech to the Association for Financial Professionals of Canada (Montréal Chapter), Montréal, Quebec, 26 March). 8  The value of securitized mortgages grew from $160 billion in 2007 to $386 billion at end-2012. 9  The Bank of Canada’s June 2013 Financial System Review provides an updated assessment of the system-wide risks associated with household sector imbalances. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  • Making money market funds less vulnerable to runs, through an appropriate combination of capital and liquidity requirements, and restrictions on withdrawals; • Establishing a clear and consistent framework for regulating other shadow banking institutions; • Limiting banks’ exposure to shadow banking activity; and • Providing the right degree of transparency around many aspects of shadow banking, so that market discipline can work better. Conclusion As I have stressed, shadow banking delivers important benefits to the economy. There is a need for the liquidity and maturity transformation, credit extension and risk transfer it provides. In delivering these services, it is healthy to have an alternative to the traditional banking system that provides competition, diversity and innovation. At the same time, reforms are needed to make shadow banking safer. Shadow banking should be made less susceptible to run-like behaviour and contagion. Aligning incentives – through transparency and appropriate regulation – is also essential. Canada has a stake in these reforms, both as a beneficiary of a more resilient global financial system and because our own shadow banking activities could be made more robust. Since innovation is one of the key benefits of shadow banking, innovation is also a fact of life in regulating the sector. Shadow banking has been known to reinvent itself and will continue to do so in response to regulation. We will need to develop and adopt principles that are broad-based enough to encompass new activities. Risk is inherent in the global financial system. We can’t stamp it all out, nor would we want to. Rather, the goal is to create incentives so that risk is allocated and managed appropriately, both in banking and in shadow banking activities, making the entire financial system stronger and more resilient. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jerome H Powell: Thoughts on unconventional monetary policy Speech by Mr Jerome H Powell, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Bipartisan Policy Center, Washington DC, 27 June 2013. *      *      * Views expressed in this speech are mine and may not represent those of the FOMC or any of its members. I would like to thank members of the Board staff, including James Clouse, Dan Covitz, Jon Faust, John Maggs, Raven Molloy, Karen Pence, Jeremy Rudd, and Brad Strum. It is great to be back at the Bipartisan Policy Center. I will comment briefly on the outlook for the economy and then turn to monetary policy.  Near-term outlook Our economy has grown at an average annual rate of only about 2 percent since the recovery began exactly four years ago. That modest pace is notably weaker than the experience of past recoveries would have predicted, even accounting for the depth and duration of the Great Recession.1 Since 2009, the question has been when the recovery will decisively take hold and begin to deliver the higher levels of growth that are needed to put people back to work more quickly. Against that background, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last week, and, among other tasks, each of the 19 members of the Committee submitted individual economic projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation for 2013 through 2015. These forecasts are combined into the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), a high-level outline of which was released at the Chairman’s press conference last week. FOMC participants generally expect an acceleration of the recovery through 2013 and 2014 and continued strong growth in 2015. While I make no claim to special forecasting skills, my individual projections are within the so-called central tendency of the projections. Of course, the economy has looked to be poised for a breakout several times since 2009, only to disappoint. Will this time be different? There are, in my view, good reasons to believe that the economy will continue to gain strength. I would point in particular to the housing sector, which in prior recoveries has been an important engine of growth. For the first two years of the current recovery, housing contributed nothing to growth, as housing investment hovered at extremely low levels. House prices declined sharply through most of 2011, wiping out about half of home equity and restraining consumer spending. But the housing market finally began to recover in early 2012, and that recovery seems to be proceeding strongly. Single-family housing starts have risen by more than 40 percent over the past two years, albeit from a low base. House prices are up more than 10 percent over the past 12 months. A better housing market has helped boost consumer attitudes from very low levels and supported consumer spending. The housing sector is still being held back by limited credit availability for less-creditworthy homebuyers and tight conditions for homebuilders. But overall trends suggest to me that the housing recovery can continue for many years and become an important contributor to growth.                                                 1  See Greg Howard, Robert Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson (2011), “Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises Really So Different?“ International Finance Discussion Papers 1037 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March); and Janet L. Yellen (2013), “A Painfully Slow Recovery for America’s Workers: Causes, Implications, and the Federal Reserve’s Response,“ speech delivered at “A Trans-Atlantic Agenda for Shared Prosperity,” a conference sponsored by the AFL-CIO, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, and the IMK Macroeconomic Policy Institute, held in Washington, February 11. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The labor market has also made real progress, as I will discuss in a moment. Auto sales have nearly returned to pre-recession levels. Our financial system is far healthier and better capitalized than it was before the crisis. And after losing one-half of its value during the financial crisis, the stock market now exceeds its pre-recession peak in nominal terms. Growth would be higher this year but for U.S. fiscal policy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the pace of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth about 1–1/2 percentage points this year.2 Tight fiscal policy may also be preventing faster reductions in unemployment. I have been surprised by how well consumer spending – and private domestic final demand more generally – have held up in the face of this pronounced fiscal drag. In the first quarter of this year, consumer spending and private domestic final demand rose at an annual rate of just above 2–1/2 percent. More-recent indicators of household and business spending suggest that private demand is continuing to advance at a reasonable clip despite the fiscal tightening. This strength is a reason for optimism. Indeed, even if real GDP rises only 2 percent or so this year—which is at the bottom end of the range of projections from the June SEP—it would still represent a solid performance in the face of these fiscal headwinds. There is still a long way to go before we achieve a full recovery. The healing process will take time, but we continue to make real progress. Let’s turn to monetary policy, starting with the dual mandate, pursuant to which the Congress directs the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy so as to foster stable prices and full employment. Dual mandate – inflation Inflation is currently running below the FOMC’s 2 percent long-term objective for personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation, and these readings have our attention. But inflation often fluctuates for transitory reasons. We generally try to look through such transitory movements, whether above or below our objective. There is some reason to think that the recent low readings partly reflect transitory factors. Other factors point to a gradual increase in inflation. While some measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved down, others remain more stable. Most FOMC participants anticipate that inflation will gradually move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent target over coming years. Continued low or falling inflation could, however, raise real concerns. Inflation can be too low as well as too high. I have no doubt that the Committee will monitor this carefully and defend the inflation goal “from below,” if necessary. Dual mandate – full employment The employment side of the dual mandate is a different story. From payroll employment’s peak in January 2008 to its trough in February 2010, the U.S. economy lost nearly 9 million jobs, while the unemployment rate rose from an average of about 4–1/2 percent in 2007 to a high of 10 percent in October of 2009. As the economy has recovered, we have regained only about three-fourths of those lost jobs. Unemployment was 7.6 percent in May and so has come down about 2–1/2 percentage points from its peak. A broader measure that includes those who can only find part-time work, as well as those who want a job but have stopped looking, was 13.8 percent last month; in 2007, this measure averaged  8–1/4 percent. In addition, long-term unemployment remains very high – 4.4 million Americans or about 37 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for six months or more. These numbers                                                 2  Congressional Budget Office (2013), The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023 (Washington: CBO, February). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  represent tragedy and hardship for these workers and their families, of course, but they also represent a crucial economic challenge. The longer workers are unemployed, the greater the likelihood that their skills will erode and workers will lose attachment to the labor force, permanently damaging the economy’s dynamism and potential output. To summarize, although inflation is below target, it is expected by most observers to return over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to carefully monitor inflation developments. But we are still far from full employment. The case for continued support for the economy from monetary policy is strong. Implications for monetary policy The federal funds rate has been near zero since late 2008, and since then the FOMC has been providing accommodation through two relatively new policy tools. These tools are “forward guidance” about the future level of the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate charged on overnight loans between banks, and large-scale asset purchase programs (“asset purchases,” or LSAPs). In part, the forward-guidance tool is embodied in the thresholds the FOMC adopted last December. The Committee indicated its intention to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent, provided inflation one- to two-years ahead is projected to be no higher than 2.5 percent.4 3And under the current flow-based LSAP program, adopted last year, we are purchasing $85 billion a month in long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Although the level of purchases may vary depending on economic conditions, the program will continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, in a context of price stability. I see the first tool, forward guidance about rates, as really an extension of traditional central bank rate-setting policy. By stating an intention to hold rates low and linking that intention to the path of the economy, forward guidance affects the path of longer-term rates and allows the market to make adjustments to these rates as economic conditions evolve. The second tool is large-scale asset purchases. By purchasing and holding large amounts of Treasury securities and MBS, we put additional downward pressure on term premiums and so on long-term rates. Asset purchases are an innovative, unconventional policy. Their likely benefits may be accompanied by costs and risks, the nature and size of which remain uncertain. These two policies are complementary but play somewhat different roles. Asset purchases are being deployed to add near-term momentum to the economy. After those purchases are eventually completed, the purchased assets will remain on the Fed’s balance sheet for some time and continue to put downward pressure on rates. The Committee will continue to use interest rate policy, including forward guidance about short-term rates, as we return to full employment. Provided inflation remains in check, the Committee will begin to assess whether to increase short-term rates when unemployment reaches 6.5 percent. Two important considerations are likely to arise at that time. First, if inflation remains low, as expected, that would be a signal that there is still significant slack in the economy. Second, a variety of other information will shed further light on the health of the labor market, including the labor force participation rate, flows into and out of employment, and other measures of labor slack. After the Committee first raises short-term rates, it will take a balanced, and in all likelihood gradual, approach consistent with its longer-run goals of full employment and inflation of 2 percent.                                                 3  The Committee’s long-run objective for PCE inflation remains 2 percent. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “FOMC Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (PDF),” statement, January 29. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Both forward guidance and asset purchases work by lowering longer-term interest rates and contributing to an easing of overall financial market conditions. Lower rates increase economic activity through a variety of channels.4 Businesses and households react to lower rates by investing and spending more. Lower rates also support the prices of housing and financial assets such as stocks and bonds. Higher asset prices increase wealth and, with a lag, induce higher spending. In all likelihood, the current LSAP program will continue for some time. It is therefore appropriate to ask how well asset purchases have worked, and whether they are still working today. Benefits Most research has found, and I agree, that the first round of purchases of longer-term securities, which began in November 2008, contributed significantly to ending the financial crisis and preventing a much more severe economic contraction. The second round of purchases that began in November 2010 also appears to have been successful in countering disinflationary pressures.5  Now that the financial crisis has receded and the economy is recovering at a moderate pace, are asset purchases still effective? In my view, the evidence across the channels is mixed, but positive on balance. Economic models are used to provide a necessarily uncertain estimate of the effect on the economy of the FOMC’s asset purchases. The Fed’s workhorse macro model is FRB/US, which estimates a reduction of about 20 basis points in the unemployment rate after three years in the wake of $500 billion in purchases of longer-term securities. There are reasons to think that this estimate may be too low; for example, FRB/US does not include any direct channel for LSAPs to boost house prices. There are also reasons to think that the estimate might be too high, since some of the channels by which lower rates spur economic activity could be attenuated in current circumstances, for example, by lower credit availability for small businesses and less creditworthy households, or corporate and household risk aversion. My view is that the LSAPs continue to provide meaningful support for economic activity but perhaps less than what the FRB/US estimates suggest. Although the channels may not be working perfectly, it is unlikely that they are not working at all. Beyond these model-predicted effects, it also seems likely that the economy continues to benefit from the knowledge that the Federal Reserve is committed to supporting growth as long as necessary.                                                 4  See Jonathan McCarthy (2013), “The Monetary Transmission Mechanism,” speech delivered at “The Federal Reserve in the 21st Century: A Symposium for College Professors,“ held in New York, March 4–5. 5  See Canlin Li and Min Wei (2012), “Term Structure Modelling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large Scale Asset Purchase Programs,“ Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2012–37 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May); Arvind Krishnamurthy and Annette Vissing-Jørgensen (2011), “The Effects of Quantitative Easing on Interest Rates: Channels and Implications for Policy (PDF),” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 215–65; Stefania D’Amico, William English, David López-Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchase Programmes: Rationale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415–F446; James D.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Costs of LSAPs What of the potential costs or risks of the asset purchases? A variety of concerns have been raised over time. With inflation in check, the most important potential risk, in my view, is that of financial instability. One concern is that our policies might drive excessive risk-taking or create bubbles in financial assets or housing. A related worry is that the eventual process of reducing purchases and normalizing the balance sheet may itself be destabilizing or disruptive to the economy. Indeed, recent volatility in markets is in part related to concerns about the possibility of a reduction in asset purchases. I’ll address both of these broad concerns, starting with incentives for risk-taking. Monetary policy has helped to keep real interest rates low. While longer-term real rates have turned positive in recent weeks, they remain at historically low levels. Experience suggests that low real rates, if maintained for a long time, can lead to asset price bubbles and eventually to financial instability. But low rates are not solely or even primarily a result of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policies; they are rooted in the market’s expectations of low inflation and the weakness of the economic recovery, factors weighing on rates not just in the United States but throughout the advanced economies.6 Given low real rates and low inflation, expected nominal returns should be low across all asset classes. The concern would be that these conditions, and our policies, could be encouraging irrational expectations of high returns. Is there any sign of that now? By most measures, equity valuations seem to be within a normal range. Whether one looks at trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, or option prices, there is little basis for arguing that markets show excessive optimism about future returns. Of course, in the equity markets there is always downside risk. But, as my Board colleague Jeremy Stein has observed, there have been signs of a “reach for yield” in the fixed-income markets for some time.7 Demand for higher-yielding fixed-income securities has outstripped new supply. The result has been very low rates, declining spreads, increasing leverage, and pressure on non-price terms such as covenants. These concerns have diminished somewhat as rates have risen since mid-May. Nonetheless, since it is likely that asset purchases will continue for some time, markets will need careful monitoring. What about house prices? At the peak of the bubble, house prices were more than 40 percent above their usual relationship to rents, according to one model that the Fed staff follows. At their trough, house prices had fallen about 10 percent below fair valuation. Given the price increases over the past year, they are – by the lights of this one model – moving back into the approximate neighborhood of fair valuation. The second concern is that the process of normalizing monetary policy and the balance sheet could itself be destabilizing or disruptive to the economy. Many cite the experiences of 1994 and 2003, when long-term rates increased quite sharply on changing views about the likely near-term path of policy. In those instances, there were both changes in views about the economy and changes in the public’s understanding of the Federal Reserve’s policy intentions. These same two factors have affected markets in recent weeks.                                                 6  See Ben S. Bernanke (2013), “Long-Term Interest Rates,” speech delivered at “The Past and Future of Monetary Policy,” a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, held in San Francisco, March 1. 7  See Jeremy C. Stein (2013), “Overheating in Credit Markets: Origins, Measurement, and Policy Responses,” speech delivered at “Restoring Household Financial Stability after the Great Recession: Why Household Balance Sheets Matter,” a research symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, held in St. Louis, Mo., February 5–7. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Market adjustments since May have been larger than would be justified by any reasonable reassessment of the path of policy. In particular, the reaction of the forward and futures markets for short-term rates appears out of keeping with my assessment of the Committee’s intentions, given its forecasts. The June SEP shows that 15 of 19 participants see the first rate increase happening in 2015 or 2016. The path of rates will ultimately depend on the path of the economy, and the Committee has said that the first rate increase will not happen until a considerable time has elapsed after asset purchases have been concluded. Thus, to the extent the market is pricing in an increase in the federal funds rate in 2014, that implies a stronger economic performance than is forecast either by most FOMC participants or by private forecasters. We have made significant strides in communication in recent years. The unemployment and inflation thresholds I discussed earlier, as well as the communication around asset purchases, are all designed to improve public understanding of the Committee’s intentions. But communications are bound to be imperfect, and changes in the outlook can still lead to adjustments in asset prices. Thus, some volatility is unavoidable, and indeed is a necessary part of the process by which markets and the economy adjust to incoming information. The path ahead for monetary policy Last week, the Chairman provided greater clarity about the path of asset purchases. Specifically, the Chairman noted that, if incoming data are broadly consistent with the Committee’s sense of the economic outlook, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year. If the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with the Committee’s current expectations for the economy, the Committee could continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around mid-year. At that time, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with growth consistent with further improvements and inflation heading back toward our objective. If unemployment reaches the 7 percent range, that would constitute a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced the current program of asset purchases. I want to emphasize the importance of data over date. If the Committee’s economic outlook is broadly realized, there will likely be a moderation in the pace of purchases later this year. If the performance of the economy is weaker, the Committee may delay before moderating purchases or even increase them. If the economy strengthens faster than the Committee anticipates, the pace of purchases may be moderated somewhat more quickly. The path of purchases is in no way predetermined; we will monitor economic data and adjust our purchases as appropriate. In my view, there has been real progress in the labor market. The Committee first adopted the “substantial improvement” test at the September 2012 meeting, so it is appropriate to measure the economy’s progress against economic conditions at that time. When the Committee met in September, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent. Today, just nine months later, the unemployment rate is 7.6 percent – a larger decline than most FOMC participants expected in September. At the time of the September meeting, nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 97,000 over the prior six months.8 Today the trailing six-month average payroll growth is 194,000. Other labor market indicators also show moderate progress, including aggregate hours worked, initial unemployment insurance claims, the duration of unemployment, and the share of long-term unemployment.                                                 8  The level of payroll employment would subsequently be revised up, but the Committee didn’t know at the September 2012 meeting that the revision would occur. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Conclusion There are many signs that the economy is healing. If the Committee’s economic outlook is broadly realized, and we do see the first moderation in the pace of purchases later this year, that would be good news. The first reduction in purchases, when it comes, will be an acknowledgement of the economy’s progress and a sign of the Committee’s confidence in the path to full recovery. In all cases, the path of policy will remain fully data-dependent. If economic growth, unemployment, or inflation do not meet the Committee’s expectations, or if financial conditions evolve in a way that is inconsistent with continued recovery, the Committee will respond. Thanks, and I am happy to take your questions. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Pang: Strategies for the development of Islamic capital markets Welcoming remarks by Mr Peter Pang, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the IFSB seminar on “Strategies for the development of Islamic capital markets”, Hong Kong, 27 June 2013. *      *      * Secretary-General Jaseem Ahmed, Your Excellency Abdullah Salem Al-Turifi, distinguished speakers and delegates, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning. 1. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is very honoured to host this seminar organised by the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) with the support of the Treasury Markets Association (TMA). It is a great pleasure to welcome you all and a special thanks to the speakers and delegates who have travelled a long way from overseas to attend this event. 2. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the IFSB. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the Board for the invaluable contributions it has made in the last decade to develop the Islamic financial services industry, particularly in bringing Islamic financial products to the mainstream by issuing prudential standards that are in compliance with Shariah principles while being consistent with international standards, and organising international events to promote market awareness of the opportunities offered by the Islamic capital markets. 3. The theme of today’s seminar – “Strategies for the Development of Islamic Capital Markets” – is most timely and relevant to Hong Kong as we are about to introduce an enhanced legal framework as a first step to promote the sustainable development of Islamic finance and we are eager to learn the other key components to form a coherent strategy. We very much look forward to the insightful views of the distinguished speakers on the latest developments of the global Islamic capital markets, the prospects and opportunities that lie ahead, and further ideas to bring Islamic capital markets to the mainstream. Growing importance of Islamic finance in the global financial scene 4. Being an international financial centre, it is important for Hong Kong to embrace Islamic finance given its rising prominence in the global financial arena. The size of the global Islamic capital markets has expanded more than 10-fold since its early phase of development in the 1980s, reaching an estimated US$1.6 trillion at the end of 2012.1 With this critical mass, Islamic finance has become an integral part of the global financial system not only catering for the needs of Muslims, but also attracting other investors and fund raisers, regardless of race and religion. Reflecting the deepening sophistication of this market, we are seeing an increasing variety of products and services, ranging from Islamic banking products and sukuk, to Islamic equities, Islamic funds and takaful. 5. This remarkable market deepening process has not been retarded by the challenging financial landscape. Despite the global financial crisis and European sovereign debt problems, the Islamic capital markets have shown unparalleled resilience over the past few years. In particular, the sukuk market climbed to new heights for the fourth year in a row, with global sukuk issuance exceeding US$130 billion in 2012, three times higher than that before the global financial crisis.2                                                  1  Source: KFH Research. 2  Source: KFH Research. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Strengths of Hong Kong in developing Islamic finance 6. Hong Kong is well positioned to add momentum to the globalisation of Islamic finance. As a free and open economy and major international financial centre, Hong Kong has developed a highly liquid and deep capital market with a strong presence of international financial intermediaries and a diverse base of borrowers and investors, a well-established financial infrastructure, a sound legal system, a transparent regulatory framework and a simple tax regime. 7. In addition to these general capabilities in financial intermediation, Hong Kong can play a unique and pivotal role in bridging the investment needs from the Middle East and the funding needs in Mainland China. 8. Many Middle East investors are now actively looking for investment opportunities beyond their domestic borders to diversify their investment portfolios. This trend has been supported by the huge pool of oil-driven liquidity in the Middle East. Last year alone, oil revenues in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries were estimated to be about US$700 billion.3 Mainland China has been one of their favourite investment destinations given its strong economic growth and emerging market opportunities. 9. On the other side, Mainland China is facing huge funding needs for infrastructure development projects. As China’s global financial centre, Hong Kong is an important conduit for Mainland companies to access the international markets and the preferred offshore capital raising centre for Mainland issuers over the past decade. This is apparent from the fact that over half of our stock market capitalisation is Mainland-related and from the high participation of Mainland entities in our dim sum bond market. 10. Against this backdrop, we believe Hong Kong is well-placed to meet the strong investment demand from the Middle East and other parts of the world for Mainland-related Islamic financial products. At the same time, Hong Kong can also provide an ideal platform for issuers from the Mainland and other parts of Asia to issue Islamic financial instruments for satisfying their funding needs. Bringing Islamic capital markets to the mainstream 11. Addressing one of the key issues to be discussed today, Hong Kong’s involvement in Islamic finance will also help to bring Islamic capital markets to the mainstream in two ways: provide a level playing field and encourage market participation in Islamic finance. 12. To bring Islamic financial products to the mainstream, a key task would be to level the playing field with their conventional counterparts. On this front, a study conducted by the Hong Kong Government in conjunction with TMA earlier concluded that there are no major legal or regulatory obstacles to transactions involving wholesale Islamic financial instruments in Hong Kong. 13. However, there is a need to refine the tax regime in Hong Kong in order to provide a level playing field between sukuk and conventional bonds. Owing to Shariah requirements, structuring sukuk often involves the originator setting up a special purpose vehicle for the purposes of issuing sukuk to sukuk holders, and multiple transfers of underlying assets between the originator and the sukuk issuer in order to generate profits. These complex structures, which are not required for conventional bonds, may incur additional tax and stamp duty expenses for the sukuk issuers. 14. I am pleased to see that an amendment bill to address this issue has been introduced into Hong Kong’s Legislative Council and is now in the final stages of enactment.                                                 3  Source: Institute for International Finance. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The bill, once passed, will enable sukuk to enjoy tax treatments similar to those currently afforded to conventional bonds. This would be a significant milestone in the development of a sukuk market in Hong Kong. 15. Apart from providing a level playing field, equally important is the active participation of market players, including non-Islamic arrangers, issuers and investors in the Islamic capital markets, as they will be the ones who lead market development in the future. Hong Kong is fortunate to have a strong presence of international financial intermediaries who can leverage on their global network of expertise to develop and structure a variety of Shariah-compliant products here. 16. It is also crucial for fund raisers and investors to be aware of the benefits of Islamic capital market instruments and understand their structures and operations. So, we have been working very closely with the TMA and international bodies like the IFSB in bringing Islamic finance seminars and workshops to Hong Kong market participants, like the seminar today, in an effort to raise the awareness and deepen the knowledge of Islamic finance among the financial community. With the gathering of such a distinguished group of speakers, I am sure that we shall obtain useful insights and get a clearer picture on how to prepare ourselves for the exciting developments in the years to come. 17. I wish this seminar every success, and to our overseas friends, an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Prasarn Trairatvorakul: Limitations of monetary policy – the context of Thailand Speech by Dr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand (FCCT), Bangkok, 17 June 2013. *      *      * Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand for the invitation. It is my honor and pleasure to be back here again to share with you my views on Thailand’s economic outlook and monetary policy. We indeed live in a volatile and uncertain world. Just a few months ago we still talked about a two- or three-speed global economy as a fact of life, with robust growth expected of emerging markets and sluggish recovery to remain with the major economies. Today, with some possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of QE, coinciding with the apparent slowdown in many emerging market economies, the convergence of the world economy is already expected by some. One obvious consequence is the market overreaction to these premature signs of the convergence. The unsettled sentiments over a potential end of cheap money may have contributed to sizeable outflows of capital from emerging markets during the past few weeks. As a consequence, emerging market currencies including the Thai baht depreciated sharply, reversing gains since the beginning of the year. One lesson from this recent episode is that, expectations can go a long way in influencing people’s behavior, and often with implications for policymakers. Specifically, it reminds us how powerful the expectations channel of monetary policy transmission can be. It is therefore of utmost importance that central banks properly manage expectations so as to maximize monetary policy effectiveness and maintain policy credibility. This draws me to the focus of my talk this evening: the limits of monetary policy, namely, what monetary policy can and cannot do. Given unprecedented economic headwinds of various sources, monetary policy around the world has been under immense demand. But these expectations, if unrealistic and not met, could damage central bank credibility, and end up diminishing central banks’ influence, with unnecessary costs to the economy. Thus, it is important that central banks establish realistic public expectations on their policy. But before I turn to that topic, let me first review current economic conditions, the outlook for the Thai economy, and recent monetary policy response. Recent economic developments and monetary policy response Despite robust economic growth of last year, the Thai economy started out this year with moderation. Growth in the first quarter at 5.3 percent compared to the same period last year was lower than what we had expected. Part of this slowdown may have been a natural reversion to a more normal pace of growth after a strong post-flood acceleration. But that alone may not explain the whole story. Evidently, the recent slowdown in private consumption also owed in part to lower farm income and higher household debts which may have held back consumers’ willingness to spend. Meanwhile, uncertainty about global demand may have pulled back private investment especially in the export-oriented sector. On the external front, despite some incipient signs of gradual improvements in the US and Japanese economy, disappointing Chinese and Asian economic performance likely put a drag on the overall Thailand’s trading partners’ growth and hence continue to weigh on Thai exports. Looking ahead, however, the medium-term trajectory of the economy should remain intact backed by solid economic fundamentals, including high levels of employment, rising income and robust private sector confidence. Fiscal policy should continue to lend support to the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  economy especially with the large-scale infrastructure investment expected to phase in from the latter part of this year. This would potentially generate a favorable crowding-in effects on private spending. As for price and financial stability, inflation eased further due to lower oil and commodity prices, in line with subdued global inflationary pressure. Looking ahead, however, the cost pass-through to prices is expected to increase as domestic demand picks up. At the same time, risks to financial stability remained an ongoing concern with a particular attention given to household debts and some sectors in real estate market. In light of these recent developments, the MPC judged that downside risks to growth have increased both from domestic demand slowdown and a somewhat slower-than-expected global recovery. Although the view on the medium-term outlook of the Thai economy has not changed, the balance of risks now seemed to tilt towards growth rather than inflation. The MPC therefore decided to cut the policy rate to provide as insurance to the economy in the face of greater downside risks to growth. With firmly anchored inflation expectations, the Bank of Thailand can today give weight to stabilizing economic developments when setting the interest rate. However, should the outlook for inflation, growth, or financial stability change in the future period, there will be room for maneuver to counteract such developments through monetary policy, as well as other policy tools in an appropriate mix deemed most suitable for achieving the overall macroeconomic stability. Limitations of monetary policy Let me now turn to a topic that I would like to highlight today, that is, the limits to what monetary policy can achieve. The global financial crisis has placed far greater demands on monetary policy around the world. In major economies where other macroeconomic policy tools are being impaired, monetary policy was under enormous pressure to support the economy. Central banks responded by expanding dramatically their traditional role as lenders of last resort and came up with innovative, unconventional ways to stretch beyond what monetary policy can normally do. In emerging markets, given large crisis repercussions in terms of excessive capital flows, monetary policy was at times expected to respond to external developments in dealing with global spillovers. Overall, monetary policy has been pushed into situations and actions that were previously unimaginable. Efforts by many central banks to overstretch its normal capacity may have led the public to expect too much from monetary policy. There is a danger associated with this conviction, if the widening gap between what is expected of central banks and what they can realistically deliver end up undermining central bank credibility. To maintain public trust in the central banks, it is important to clearly lay out what monetary policy can and cannot achieve. I would like to highlight three areas where monetary policy limits in Thailand are particularly binding at present. Understanding these limits would also help explain our monetary policy actions. 1. Single instrument, multiple objectives The first limitation has to do with the fact that multiple objectives cannot be targeted using one instrument, namely, the policy interest rate. This is a key reason why most central banks in the world today typically focus on a single primary objective of price stability, which is crucial to a well-functioning market economy and is what monetary policy has most control over. There are of course other equally important policy objectives, in particular financial stability, as recent global crisis clearly illustrated. The “flexible inflation targeting” is precisely designed to allow the central bank to stabilize not only inflation but also to mitigate the risk of a build-up of financial imbalances. Endowing central banks with more policy tools to achieve this additional objective has gathered a lot of support in international policy forums. The demand for monetary policy does not stop there, however. It has also been suggested that 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  monetary policy should respond directly to capital flows and exchange rate for example. Can a single policy interest rate target all these objectives simultaneously? Of course, in fortunate coincidences where these objectives do not conflict, there is no dilemma. More often than not, however, the policy choices will involve a trade-off between different objectives. Policymakers will have to weigh carefully the costs and benefits of a policy decision. Given multiple macroeconomic objectives, there is a need for supplementary tools to truly minimize the costs of these tradeoffs. As the first example, what policy instruments can be employed to address risks to external stability? In many emerging market economies, one often finds problems of exchange rate dominance, namely the risk that exchange rate considerations dominate the conduct of monetary policy and distract central banks from the main goal of price stability. The simplest way to address this problem would be to allow for exchange rate flexibility as the first line of defense. Of course, this does not and should not rule out interventions to limit excessive exchange rate volatility. That is the next line of defense. Should the situation warrant, some type of capital flow management measures can be deployed in exceptional circumstances of sustained and substantial exchange rate overvaluation. However, given their distortive effects and collateral damage it brings upon the economy, any introduction of this type of measures will have to be carefully designed to minimize unintended consequences, especially on productive long-term capital inflows that we highly value. As for the case of preventing financial imbalances, it is sometimes proposed that for policy rate to have sufficient traction in addressing risks to financial stability, the adjustments may need to be so large as to have a significant adverse impact on economic activity, a price too dear to pay. Thus, with an additional objective of managing credit growth and asset prices in order to avoid financial instability, one really needs another instrument that acts more directly on the source of the problem. That is what “macro-prudential policy” is supposed to achieve. 2. Imperfect foresight The second limitation of monetary policy lies with the notion that all policymakers have limited capacity to measure economic performance very precisely even in real time, not to mention to forecast the future. Monetary policy is always conducted in an uncertain environment. Unforeseen macroeconomic shocks, imprecisely estimated effects of policy on macroeconomic variables, and noisy measurement render monetary policy design and implementation a challenging task. Our state of knowledge is also far from a perfect understanding of people’s decision making that determine the future evolution of the economy. The task is even more daunting when the world is going through significant transformation, with unprecedented policy actions all across the globe, and with yet-to-be- known consequences of such actions and their unwinding. Faced with the uncertainty and the complexity of the environment we are operating in, we need to take a broader perspective and make sure our decisions are robust under different plausible eventualities. At the same time, the Bank of Thailand constantly strives to expand our economic surveillance capability, by collecting up-to-date intelligence on economic and financial conditions through indirect and direct contacts with the market. The insights from direct contact, coupled with the information from surveys like our Business Sentiment Survey sharpen the picture we get from the other available statistics. This is one reason why monetary policy cannot simply follow mechanistic and simplistic rules based solely on any single data. Nonetheless, uncertainties can never be off the table. In this light, a prudent approach is to move in careful and measured steps. That kind of incremental action in what we perceive to be the right direction is likely to contribute more to economic stability than aggressive attempts to fine tune the economy. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3. Inability to address supply-side impediments The third limitation of monetary policy I would like to emphasize today is its inability to address supply-side impediments. Through interest rate adjustment, monetary policy can influence aggregate demand in the economy. But monetary policy cannot solve deeper structural problems or lift growth potential of the economy. That needs to come from real progresses that increase productivity and relax supply-side constraints. Sure, demand stimulating can buy time by cushioning the economy from short-term economic shocks. But this may possibly delay necessary adjustments of the economy to longer-term challenges. For example, keeping interest rate too low for too long and keeping exchange rate undervalued, beside encouraging risk taking and storing up financial instability problems for the future, may also temper incentives for businesses to improve efficiencies, and may slow the reallocation of capital and labor to more productive uses. In the context of Thailand, one of the most important structural issues facing the Thai economy at the moment is that of the labor shortage. Through our business contact and recent surveys, the labor shortage has scored one of the top concerns by both domestic and foreign businesses operating in Thailand. Underlying causes of labor shortage include the demographic change and education and skill mismatch. Clearly, there is little monetary policy can do to solve this supply bottleneck. It can help foster macroeconomic stability conducive to business investment, but most of the efforts to address supply-side impediments still need to come from a broader and more balanced set of economic policies including fiscal, industrial, technology, and labor market policies. Concluding remarks Let me end my talk today by saying that, as a central banker, we should be ambitious in making the best use of all available policy tools and in improving our understanding of the economy as well as the shocks driving it. But setting the ambition higher than the capability of monetary policy would likely prove to be counter-productive. It is an old established wisdom that what monetary policy can best deliver is price stability. While we have learned for a great deal about other aspects of macroeconomic stability, there is little disagreement that price stability must remain the central objective of monetary policy in the long run. Abandoning this objective risks de-anchoring price expectations and inducing unnecessary economic volatility. The deployment of supplementary tools can go some way to help relax its limitation, but monetary policy is no panacea. Ladies and Gentlemen, Only by understanding both the power and limits of monetary policy, will the economy be able to reap the most benefit out of this policy lever. The Bank of Thailand will continue to do our utmost to strive for overall macroeconomic stability, and the long-term prosperity of Thailand. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Regulatory and governance for Islamic finance Speech by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Brunei Darussalam Islamic Investment Summit 2013 “Regulatory and governance for Islamic finance”, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, 19 June 2013. *      *      * It is my great pleasure to be here in Brunei Darussalam to speak at this Islamic Investment Summit 2013. My remarks today will discuss the current landscape of Islamic finance in Asia in the context of the growing role of Asia in the global economy, and the important priorities for Islamic finance to strengthen its prospects for future growth and stability. Asia and the global economy The global economic landscape is now significantly evolving as it progresses towards a new more multi-polar world. This is being shaped by the increasing contribution of emerging economies to global economic growth, with some of the most vibrant and dynamic emerging economies being in the Asian region. In 2012, the Asian region contributed 56% to global growth. This advancement takes place at a time when the world economy continues to be significantly challenged by the lingering effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, with a sustainable economic recovery yet to be secured. Asia’s growth trajectory has been underpinned by several favorable fundamentals, which will continue to support its prospects for growth going forward. Asia is a highly diverse region in terms of its economic and demographic structure, market size, stage of development, and political systems. This provides immense opportunities for the region to leverage on its complementarities to boost economic growth. Being the most populous region in the world, Asia’s favourable demographic structure, comprising a significant young population and a rising middle income segment, constitutes a huge and growing consumer market. The unlocking of this potential growth has also been advanced through wide ranging policy initiatives to promote higher consumption demand. The measures have essentially aimed at strengthening the social welfare system through increased arrangements for healthcare and retirement, and improving the macroeconomic environment and reducing the income gap. These measures collectively seek to support domestic drivers of growth thus making the development process more inclusive and sustainable. In parallel with these measures is the drive towards urbanization and the infrastructure development in the region. The Asian Development Bank has estimated that Asia needs to invest a total of USD8 trillion to fund infrastructure development such as rail networks, airports, power networks and water treatment plants in the current decade to 2020. These investments, reinforced by the growing consumer market, have become an important driver of private investment activity. This trend is also well supported by the growing and resilient financial systems in the region. Intra-regional trade activity is also rapidly increasing, signifying the deepening of economic ties within the region. Intra-regional trade in East Asia has expanded from an average of 44% of total trade in 1995, to 50% in 2010. Similarly, intra-regional investment activities have been on a rising trend. More recent efforts have focused on strengthening regional financial integration which is aimed at promoting the more efficient intermediation of funds in Asia. The strengthening of domestic demand and the greater regional financial and economic connectivity within Asia has also enhanced the resilience of the region. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Islamic finance in the evolving new frontier in Asia Given that Islamic finance is a form of financial intermediation that is closely linked to the real economy arising from its requirement that financial transactions needs to have an underlying economic transaction, its accelerated growth and dynamic expansion across the financial landscape in Asia brings with it the tremendous potential to reinforce the transformative trend that is characterizing the region. With greater liberalization, Islamic finance is increasingly supporting regional and international trade and investment flows, intermediating significant cross border financial flows. With its internationalisation, Islamic finance has become an increasingly more important channel for the efficient allocation of Asia’s surplus funds towards productive investments in the region. This trend is also contributing towards the strengthening of global financial and economic linkages, particularly between Asia and the Middle East. The vast population in Asia and the growing middle-income group, combined with high savings rates in the region have substantially heightened the demand for a wider spectrum of financial products and services. These trends have increased the opportunities in retail and investment banking, takaful, and fund and wealth management businesses in the region. An area that Islamic finance has a major potential role is in the reorientation towards achieving a more inclusive and sustainable growth – an important post-crisis development agenda. Serving the small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) presents huge potential for Islamic financial institutions, particularly those with the capability to deploy innovative equity-based structures and alternative forms of financing, such as private equity and venture capital. Asia is also now becoming a primary force for the global Sukuk market, with 68% or USD120 billion of the total sukuk outstanding in 2011 originating from the region, thereby providing an important investor base for sukuk issuance from different parts of the world. Whilst Malaysia has evolved a vibrant sukuk market, more Asian countries have turned to the sukuk market for financing large-scale projects including for infrastructure development. Several countries in the region are currently reviewing their legislation and taxation to enable debut sukuk issuance. The Asian sukuk market has also been progressive in the innovation frontiers. There has also been a growing trend for multi-currency sukuk issuances. This provides greater prospects for tapping a wider pool of investors, including from the Middle East and Europe. In Malaysia and more recently, in Indonesia, Sukuk issuances have also aimed at retail investors. This is to take advantage of the high levels of surplus savings in Asia, whilst providing wider investment options to retail investors that have traditionally invested in bond funds and unit trusts. The trend for greater regional economic and financial integration will also provide substantial opportunities for Islamic financial institutions to facilitate the integration process in the region and with other parts of the world, and thus have a greater role in financing Asia’s future growth. Priorities for strengthening financial stability and growth Let me turn to the priorities for strengthening financial stability and growth. Whilst there needs to be continued efforts at the national level to develop the institutional foundations for Islamic finance that will foster effective and efficient financial flows, and ensure that financial stability is preserved, the new wave of internationalization for Islamic finance requires increased collaboration across jurisdictions to strengthen the international financial infrastructure of Islamic finance. Going forward into the future, this will be particularly important given that the international environment has become more challenging. This is to ensure that the greater internationalization of Islamic finance takes place in an environment of financial stability. At the national level, the first priority relates to trend for the domestic Islamic financial system to become more integrated allowing for risks to be rapidly transmittal across the financial system. This requires the development of enhanced regulatory, supervisory and legal 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  frameworks that are also adaptive and effective to the innovative dynamics and unique mix of risks in Islamic finance. Fundamental to this is the implementation of the international regulatory and supervisory standards and best practices for Islamic finance. The Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) has introduced prudential standards for the Islamic financial services industry – in all key areas of capital adequacy, risk management, corporate governance and Shariah governance. Their implementation would in turn promote more consistent regulatory and supervisory frameworks across borders. Importantly, the adoption of these international prudential standards which are aligned to the core principles and standards adopted by the Basel Committee, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), would serve to minimise the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage arising from cross-sectoral and cross-border differences, whilst ensuring that the regulatory requirements that are distinct for Islamic finance are effectively addressed. A survey conducted by the IFSB in 2011 indicated that 9 countries have implemented the standards issued by the IFSB and that 18 countries are expected to implement them within the next five years. Their consistent implementation will be vital. This harmonization will also facilitate consistent participation in Islamic finance across borders and contribute towards global financial stability. Whilst micro-supervision is an integral part of the toolkit for ensuring financial system stability, the recent global crisis highlighted the need for it to be complemented by macroprudential surveillance and measures. This dimension of prudential regulation involves the incorporation of horizontal assessments of risks across institutions, sectors and national borders, including the risks in asset markets. This is to address systemic risks and to take into account the interconnectedness within the financial system. This is particularly relevant for the Islamic financial services industry given the close link of Islamic finance with the real economic sector through the various modes of Islamic financing contracts. In particular, heightened surveillance is needed over developments in the real estate and commodity markets. Equally important is a greater understanding of the inter-relationships between the financial and the real sector, including the potential for second round effects that are transmitted across sectors of the financial system and the economy. The increased cross-border reach of Islamic finance has also underscored the importance of enhanced cross-border collaboration among the supervisory authorities. Information-sharing and effective coordination among supervisors will enable a complete understanding of the entire risk spectrum of the risk taking activities undertaken across jurisdictions by the Islamic financial institutions. This is especially important in crisis situations, given the serious ramifications of a delayed or ineffective response to cross-border contagion. Robust institutional arrangements are therefore vital to improve the efficiency of the supervisory processes and to allow for the early detection and management of cross-border transmission of risks arising from group-wide activities. Another key area is the evolution of the legal framework for Islamic finance. This is to provide greater certainty and to build public confidence in the system as a whole. This necessitates a legal framework that enforces end-to-end Shariah compliance in the Islamic financial services industry – through provisions and mechanisms that unambiguously define the conduct and governance of Islamic financial institutions. It needs to recognize the distinct elements in Islamic finance and identify risks and challenges associated with the different Islamic contractual arrangements and the instruments for the appropriate regulatory treatment of the Islamic financial transactions. There is also a need for court recognition and acceptance of the Islamic contracts within the common and civil law systems, with a consistent approach of interpreting the rights of the contracting parties based on Shariah principles. This will lend certainty and predictability to the financial transactions and is particularly important in evolving legal frameworks that are facilitative of cross-border transactions as Islamic financial activities continue to venture beyond domestic borders. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In Malaysia, the new legal framework for Islamic banking and takaful that will come into force this year, will pave the way for the development of an end-to-end Shariah compliant regulatory framework for the conduct of Islamic financial operations. This new framework provides clarity on the fundamental requirements of Shariah that must be adhered to for the contractual arrangements between the financial institution and the customer to remain enforceable. The framework also outlines the operational requirements for the effective application of Shariah principles in the conduct of Islamic financial institutions. This aims to strengthen the risk management practices beyond the traditional credit, market and liquidity risks, to also include inventory risk, ownership risk and Shariah compliance risk. The legislation also provides for the resolution of Islamic financial institutions to be in line with distinctive elements of the relevant Islamic contracts, thus improving the legal and procedural aspects for the orderly resolution of Islamic financial institutions. Another important area of priority is to achieve the further harmonization and mutual recognition of Shariah interpretations across jurisdictions. The progressive harmonization will be a major driving force for the internationalization of the Islamic financial system. The reduced uncertainty from differences in Shariah interpretations will also contribute to safeguarding financial stability. The continuous and constructive engagement amongst scholars, regulators and practitioners within and across the regions will pave the way for greater understanding and mutual respect for the Shariah views. This also needs to be supported by in-depth research and greater transparency on Shariah rulings and resolutions. The International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA), through its Shariah research undertakings and activities in promoting constant engagement among international scholars, has been at the forefront in driving progressive harmonization of Shariah at the regional and international levels. Its annually organized Muzakarah Cendekiawan Shari’ah Nusantara has emerged as an important platform for greater consensus to be forged among the Shariah scholars in the Nusantara. Finally, is the imperative for a robust liquidity management infrastructure for Islamic finance, both at the national and international levels. This is vital not only to ensure the resilience and stability of the Islamic financial system but also to reduce the cost of intermediation. Cross-border liquidity risk management in the Islamic financial system still remains a significant challenge, with the lack of short-term Shariah compliant instruments in international currencies. The global efforts to strengthen the liquidity arrangements for the international Islamic financial system will be an important breakthrough in facilitating more efficient cross-border liquidity management by Islamic financial institutions, thereby meeting the challenges of the trend of greater internationalisation. Conclusion Let me now conclude. The growing role of the emerging economies as an anchor to global growth in particular, in Asia, represents a major shift in the global economic landscape. In this environment, Islamic finance is well-positioned to assume a much larger role as a competitive form of financial intermediation for supporting economic activity, and as a channel for enhancing greater global connectivity. Efforts to strengthen the foundations for Islamic finance to ensure its continued resilience amid the more challenging environment must remain a priority going forward into the future. Indeed, our commitment to act guided by this foresight will strengthen the prospect for Islamic finance to realize its potential in the region and beyond.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Pentti Hakkarainen: Minimise the use of public money through the Banking Union Speech by Mr Pentti Hakkarainen, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the  15th Integrated Financial Supervisors Conference, Copenhagen, 25 June 2013. *      *      * Thank you very much for inviting me today to this conference here in Copenhagen. It is a pleasure to speak on such an extremely timely topic like the Banking Union. As we all know, finance ministers did not reach a political compromise on the bank recovery and resolution directive yet on Friday/Saturday. We should hear positive news on the bank recovery and resolution directive (BRRD), which is an important milestone in the road towards the Banking Union. Moreover, we are waiting also for the final vote on the Single Supervisory Mechanism by the European Parliament in early July. I hope this timetable will hold so that we can proceed well with the preparations to kick-off the single supervisory system in 2014. Why a Banking Union? Let me start with the question why it has been necessary to establish the Banking Union and the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) as its key component? The crisis since 2008 has made it clear that a highly interconnected and integrated euro area requires a stronger institutional framework than what we currently have. A problem at one bank can quickly spread to other banks both at home and beyond national borders with devastating effects on the real economy and taxpayers. Furthermore, this crisis led to a sudden stop of capital flows within Europe, as banks withdrew within national borders and financial integration took serious setbacks.  An important element to strengthen the financial institutional framework is the creation of the Banking Union. The agreement to establish the SSM has been reached at a record pace. A strong and independent supranational supervisor is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the monetary union and to restore confidence in the banking sector. The key element in confidence rebuilding is the balance sheet assessment of banks to be conducted before the SSM is up and running and timely action, if necessary, on potential weaknesses in banks’ balance sheets. The idea is that legacy asset problems should be detected and potential capital shortages corrected before the operational start of the SSM and shifting of the supervisory responsibility to the European Central Bank (ECB). Credibility of national supervision has suffered because of three reasons. First, national mandates of the supervisors lead to inability to handle cross-border challenges. Second, the so called regulatory capture i.e. close relationships between banks and the supervisor led at instances to slow reactions or unwillingness to react at all to noticed problems in banks. Third, a suspicion of political influences in supervision has weakened the standing and credibility of supervisors. Moreover, in 2010 it became desperately evident that the bank and sovereign risks are tightly interconnected and with two-way causality. The establishment of the SSM will be a major step forward and can help to address these shortcomings but, alone, will not be sufficient. Single supervision needs to be accompanied with a system and powers to restructure and wind down failing banks while minimizing the cost to taxpayers. This is also the main thrust in the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) key attributes of resolution. This is more or less what the Banking Union is about. The regaining of confidence in the banking sector is the key to reverse recent developments towards financial fragmentation and help re-establish a well-functioning interbank market and capital flows. These are of key importance also for restoring economic growth and the single market programme.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches The overall Banking Union framework – key elements SLIDE: Key elements of the Banking Union The first element is the Single Rule Book. The EU has the objective of developing a Single Rule Book, which is based on the idea of maximum harmonization of basic regulatory requirements (such as capital adequacy rules) while leaving leeway for national authorities to impose stricter requirements nationally for systemic stability and macro-prudential reasons. The Single Rule Book for banking is based on CRR/CRD4/deposit guarantee directive and the upcoming bank recovery and resolution directive and is complemented by the binding standards issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA). The EBA has the legal competence to develop and monitor the implementation of the Single Rule Book.  The EBA also has the task in moving ahead with the harmonization of supervisory practices. The SSM will have to develop strongly harmonized supervisory practices (“Supervisory Manual”) in order to create a single system – also extended to smaller banks. It is expected that the SSM Manual will be significantly more detailed than the EBA’s Handbook, but the two will need to be consistent and therefore close cooperation has been already started between the SSM and the EBA. The establishment of the SSM is the second element of the Banking Union. The SSM will be a unitary supervisory system, composed of national competent authorities and the ECB – and close cooperation between them – and with the possibility of non-euro area Member States to participate. The ECB will assume direct supervisory responsibility and major decision making powers for significant banks meeting certain criteria. We expect the number of such banks to reach some 130–140.  I will discuss the SSM more in detail in a while. Before that, let me go to the third element of the Banking Union which should be the establishment of a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). An important pre-condition for this would be a swift adoption of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRR), as it lays out a harmonised toolbox of resolution powers. The Single Resolution Mechanism would build on the measures and tools laid down in the Directive, particularly by providing a robust framework that allows for prompt and coordinated resolution action, specifically where cross-border banks are concerned. An efficient resolution mechanism including the possibility to bail-in bank debt-holders is a key element in the new policy objective to have bail-in as the predominant tool in resolution and limit the use of bail-outs as far as possible. In the new regime, bail-in should be the rule, bail-out the rare exception. As we all know, the swift and orderly resolution of cross-border banks is the Achilles heel that needs to be addressed. For this purpose, one needs to move from national to supranational arrangements for significant banks. I do not need to remind that this would be particularly important for the highly integrated Nordic banking market.  The draft BRR requires that national resolution authorities cooperate with each other and that resolution colleges are established from all the resolution authorities of the countries where the bank has business operations. However, the draft BRR or any other existing arrangements do not contain compulsory coordination of resolution measures before they are taken by home and host authorities. Hence, there is no explicit and binding resolution mechanism for cross-border banks. Conflicts of interest and incentives for geographical ring-fencing that have plagued cross-border crisis management in previous cases will still be embedded in the current framework. Both home and host authorities can exercise ring-fencing at their own discretion.  It is doubtful that a resolution college could effectively coordinate in time the necessary decisions involved in the resolution of a cross-border banking group and resolve the conflicts of interest. We will need the establishment of the SRM with good decision making procedures and – hopefully in the longer run – a European Resolution Authority to implement successfully the resolution process across the countries participating in the SSM. In the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 absence of the SRM, the ECB would have to hand problem banks back to national authorities that could also create conflicts of interest as national authorities could disagree with the measures taken on the supervisory side and deviate from a desired course when exercising resolution.  The SRM should have the same institutional and geographical scope as the SSM. Ideally, and in the longer run, there should be the Single Resolution Authority, which would be at the centre of the SRM, govern the resolution of banks and coordinate the application of resolution tools. It should have a comprehensive set of enforceable tools, powers and authority to resolve all banks in the SSM. In particular it would ensure that failing banks are resolved swiftly, through impartial decision-making focused on the European dimension. The timely resolution of banks should avoid the cascading of problems from one bank to other banks, thereby affecting European financial stability.  In my view, the banking union can be established without simultaneous creation of the  pan-European deposit guarantee scheme (DGS). Harmonisation of national DGS and their use could already be sufficient step forward, including the ex ante collection of funds from banks into the deposit guarantee funds. Key features of the planned supervisory mechanism SLIDE: Timeline for the establishment of the SSM If all goes well, the European Parliament should vote on 7 July and the SSM regulation could enter into force in the beginning of August this year – meaning that the actual operation of the SSM could start in August 2014, and then the ECB could assume its direct supervisory duties.  The SSM will operate as a system, catering for all expertise of national supervisors and at the same time possessing a strong decision-making centre. Appropriate decentralisation procedures are being planned, while preserving the unity of the supervisory system and avoiding duplication. The SSM, with the ECB at its centre, is entrusted with an extensive set of micro- and macro- prudential powers, covering all key tasks relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions. This broad array of tasks and powers is crucial, as it is the foundation for the SSM to effectively supervise banks. The SSM also possesses early intervention powers as they are foreseen in the draft BRR. These early intervention powers are significant relating the governance and scope of activities of institutions that start to have serious problems that can lead them to a point of non-viability. To ensure a strong centre, the ECB’s overall responsibility for supervision within the SSM is matched by control powers over the system as a whole, as well as by very close cooperation arrangements with national authorities. What makes the SSM work truly as one system, besides the legal competence over all the banks, are the following main features:  First, all the components of the system will have to act in accordance with a system of guidelines, ECB specific regulations and manuals of supervisory practices.   Second, the ECB supervisory function, at the centre, will receive all the supervisory data, regarding all the banks.   Third, the bodies at the center of the system, at the ECB supervisory function, have the power to overtake the direct supervision of any bank or group of banks that may be considered relevant and may be the origin of systemic risk.   Fourth, the center supervises and monitors that overall supervisory quality is followed by national competent authorities. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches In practice, a risk-based approach to supervision will be adopted. Joint Supervisory Teams will be established that will integrate ECB and national competent authority (NCA) staff into single supervisory units responsible for the conduct of the on-going supervisory activities and for preparing supervisory decisions. The Teams will be established and coordinated by ECB; there will likely be one Team for each significant banking group, but tailored to the needs of each banking group (proportionality).  A common SSM Risk Assessment System is being developed, which relies on an integrated and harmonized information base. The System will be used for addressing the capital and liquidity needs of banks in the SSM and also to direct supervisory resources (e.g. inspections’ planning) on the basis of the risk- and impact assessment.  The supervision of Nordic banking groups – such as Nordea or Danske Bank – is interesting from our perspective and in particular should the home-country authorities of these groups remain outside of the SSM. In this situation, the ECB will assume the responsibility of a host supervisor of the major subsidiaries in the Euro Area which also are significant banks on their own and will enter into the SSM supervision.  SLIDE: Supervision of Nordea in the Banking Union Take Nordea as example. The supervisory college will continue to operate under Swedish leadership as before to coordinate the overall supervisory activities and form the picture of risks, capital and liquidity at the group level. As a new element the ECB will participate in the supervisory college as the responsible authority for the Euro Area subsidiaries, while the present host authorities from Finland and Estonia will still join supervisory cooperation on their behalf; which is important also to maintain full picture of financial stability in their respective countries. Should differences in opinion emerge; the EBA will mediate between the home authority and the ECB. The picture would become different, should Sweden and Denmark decide to join the SSM. It would simplify the supervisory structure if all our Nordic authorities would operate under the SSM roof.  The SSM also has powers in the macro-prudential area, which is a shared competence with national macro-prudential authorities. The ECB will comment on national measures and has the possibility to tighten the national measures if they are deemed inadequate. Macro-prudential instruments could also be applied to the euro-area financial system as a whole, in addition to individual countries. The crisis has shown that supervising the micro-prudential risks at individual banks separately is not sufficient and that macro- and micro- risks can actually be mutually reinforcing. There has to be very close cooperation between the macro-and micro-prudential functions.  The shared competence is important for two reasons. First, the system needs to be established in a way that creates incentives for action, ie the pre-crises prevailed national inaction bias needs to be broken. Second, the credit cycles differ nationally and the associated potential problems need to be mitigated through nationally diverging ways. This is a different approach compared with monetary policy in monetary union or banking supervision, in which the aim is maximum harmonization of national practices. Key milestones in the preparation of the SSM SLIDE: Key milestones in the preparation of the SSM The practical preparation of the SSM has been well underway since last autumn. In this summer the main elements of the supervisory model and the supervisory manual should be rather developed. The same goes for the ECB Framework Regulation, which is an own regulation by the ECB setting out the main responsibilities of the ECB and national authorities and the main requirements set for banks in the SSM. Also during this summer the main features of the SSM Risk Assessment System (RAS) should be available as well as the finalized list of significant banks entering into SSM direct supervision.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 During this autumn 2013 and spring 2014 the newly established SSM Supervisory Board first consults on and then adopts all the basic documents setting out the operation of the SSM, which would then start in the summer of 2014. I would like to emphasize that the Supervisory Board is the main body responsible for the supervisory functions of the SSM and the main decision making body, even decisions are formally and finally adopted by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. When it comes to the role of the Governing Council, it cannot alter the decisions of the Supervisory Board, but only prevent their entry into force if such a veto power is exercised, and only if strongly justified e.g. by monetary policy reasons. Hence, in the decision making as well as in the internal ECB organization, separation of the monetary policy and supervisory functions will be realized. During 2013 and 2014 also the ECB supervisory organization will be staffed and start their operation.  Of particular relevance for the credible start of the SSM will be the Balance Sheet Assessment (BSA) –project, making sure that all major problems in asset quality are well-known and sufficiently addressed before the operational start of the SSM. The BSA will also link with pan-European stress tests conducted in close cooperation between the EBA and the SSM during spring 2014. I believe it is in the interest of the countries which are not joining the SSM from the beginning, to follow the same level of standards in their own asset quality reviews as applied within the SSM.  Non-Euro area countries joining the SSM (Member States in close cooperation)  SLIDE: Member States in close cooperation National competent authorities of non-euro area Member States have an option to participate in the SSM. They can participate through establishing a close cooperation agreement with the ECB. By giving non-euro area Member States full membership and voting rights in the Supervisory Body, the body responsible for the preparation of decisions on supervisory matters, they are placed on an equal footing with euro-area Member States.  While the ECB Governing Council is the ultimate decision-making body of the ECB, its role in the SSM is reduced to the possibility of accepting or rejecting the decisions of the Supervisory Board. This was accepted at the level of the European Council by all governments which seem to indicate that we might see an extension of the SSM well beyond the euro area.  Joining the SSM would mean that the supervisory processes of the SSM would be applied also to non-euro area banks. This would give the benefit of streamlining and unifying supervisory processes for major cross-border banks. The special status of the non-Euro Area countries is taken into account in the decision-making mechanism. As I noted, the Governing Council enforces the decisions by the Supervisory Board. If the Council prevents the entry into force of a decision, which e.g. results in a modification of the decision, a non-EA country may announce non-satisfaction with such a decision. If the Council decision prevails, the non-EA country can choose not to adopt the decision. On its side then, the ECB could consider breaking-up the agreement for close cooperation Closing Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by saying that we are taking significant steps in our road towards the Banking Union. However, there are many steps ahead before we have reached the goal of a high quality and comprehensive pan-European supervision and resolution system. Creation of the SSM is steadily on track and we will soon see the Commission’s proposal on the SRM. It is worth to mention that the nature of supervision and resolution tasks are such that those should be kept in the hands of independent officials without political involvement. Such a system, with clear rules established for all participants, 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches would greatly reduce the contingent liability placed on tax payers and reduce the presumption of bail-outs. I am convinced that these steps are worth taking and lead us towards an efficient and credible European framework. If the financial crisis has taught us something, it is that that the sooner we identify potential problems and solve them, the less likely is the involvement of public money. A well defined and well functioning supervisory and resolution system is just about it! Slides

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Luis M Linde: Overview of Spain’s economy in 2012 – reflection and outlook Testimony by Mr Luis M Linde, Governor of the Bank of Spain, before the Parliamentary Committee on Economic Affairs and Competitiveness, Madrid, 20 June 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I appear before this Committee on the occasion of the presentation of the Banco de España Annual Report for 2012, one of the most difficult years for the Spanish economy of the last decades. I shall begin with a review of the general economic situation, and then focus on the progress achieved in restoring the major balances of our economy, developments in credit and in household and corporate debt, the headway in balance sheet clean-up and restructuring of our banking system, financial regulation reforms and progress in the European Banking Union project. I shall conclude with a reflection on the outlook for our economy. Situation of and outlook for the Spanish economy Throughout 2012 the Spanish economy held on the contractionary course that first became discernible in late 2011. GDP fell by 1.4% during the year, far above the 0.5% decline recorded in the euro area as a whole. This double-dip recession, the second dip of which is less acute in terms of the decline in output but more persistent than its 2008–2009 forerunner, has had particularly serious consequences for employment, which shrank for the fifth year running in 2012. The main macroeconomic and financial figures for 2012 speak for themselves as regards the intensity of the adjustments made in an attempt to overcome the serious imbalances that emerged during the last upturn. The fall in household income, prompted above all by the heavy decline in employment, along with high household debt, continued to exert a contractionary effect on spending capacity against an overall background of uncertainty. Once again in 2012, companies, many of which are immersed in deleveraging and financial restructuring processes, cut their investment, while the adjustment in the construction sector continued. Meanwhile, the general government sector tailored its spending plans to the need to reduce the budget deficit, following the serious budgetary slippage evidenced at the close of 2011. All these factors combined to bring about a strong decline in national demand, which was only partly offset by the positive contribution of the external sector. Imports fell forcefully, mirroring the weakness of final demand, while exports expanded despite the poor performance of the euro area markets, to which Spain still directs half of its foreign sales. However, developments to date in 2013 appear to confirm that the worst of this second recession is behind us. The biggest declines in output were at the end of 2012, and the latest data suggest the contraction in GDP is easing. Indeed, in the final stretch of the year, and even from the third quarter onwards, positive growth rates might be recorded. Fiscal consolidation Significant steps were taken last year to reduce the budget deficit and strengthen the budgetary discipline and management framework. In the first of these areas, and although both expenditure- and revenue-side measures were applied, it should be stressed that the bulk of the effort consisted of spending cuts, allowing 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  net overall general government borrowing to be reduced to 7% of GDP, or 10.6% when the assistance (a non-recurring expense) to financial institutions is included. Last month the European Commission announced a new fiscal consolidation path, setting new deficit targets of 6.5% and 5.8% for the current year, 2013, and 2014, and of around 4% for 2015, and requiring that the 3% threshold laid down by the Stability and Growth Pact be met in 2016. The additional margin provided will help soften the short-term contractionary impact of the fiscal adjustment on activity. As to public spending discipline and management, I should first mention the April 2012 Organic Law on Budgetary Stability. This legislation implements the principles of limiting the structural deficit and volume of debt that were enshrined in our Constitution in 2011. The Law makes key improvements in terms of the transparency of public finances. Many of these improvements were set in train in 2012 and early 2013. In terms of the availability of data on general government financial and budgetary conduct, Spain now probably stands at the head of the European Union countries. To highlight the most significant improvements, the Stability Law firstly sets minimum reporting requirements for regional and local government, including monthly revenue and spending outturns for regional governments, and quarterly ones for local governments, along with the information needed to calculate the budget outturn in National Accounts terms. Moreover, since June 2012, the IGAE (National Audit Office) has been regularly publishing quarterly accounts of all general government sub-sectors in National Accounts terms, on an individual basis for regional government and in aggregate terms for local government. Also, since October 2012, the monthly regional government accounts have been regularly published in budgetary accounting terms and, since March 2013, in National Accounts terms. Further, from last March, monthly National Accounts figures on Central Government and on the Social Security System began to be released, complementing the monthly State data in National Accounts and cash-basis terms, and the monthly Social Security System data in cash-basis terms that have been published for more than three decades. Apart from these reporting improvements, the Stability Law includes mechanisms to correct slippage in budget outturn. The Independent Fiscal Responsibility Authority, whose creation is scheduled for the end of this year, will complete this new governance framework. The pension system The sustainability of the pension system is pivotal to the medium- and long-term soundness and stability of public finances and to the very credibility of any consolidation programme for total public spending. This is an area where substantial measures have already been adopted, but in which it is vital to maintain the thrust of reform. Our current Social Security pension system is contributory and unfunded, and will necessarily have to continue being so. It is a fundamental factor of economic and social stability, meaning that it is in everybody’s interest to address the risk of shortfall, which is essentially due to demographic developments. To be sustainable, the system must be able to properly control its key elements, such as retirement age, the calculation of pensions and the so-called “sustainability factor”, which is currently being defined. It is welcome news that practically all the political forces are working in the spirit of the Toledo Pact which was approved almost 25 years ago and has repeatedly received the support of our Parliamentary institutions. But it is imperative to point out that, in the long run, the potential of the unfunded system to ensure retirees will enjoy a standard of living in step with the levels of income achieved in their working life may be limited. Accordingly, supplementary capitalisation formulas must be explored to allow more scope for saving during working life. These supplementary systems, of which there are examples in different countries, may be private but also public. In any 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  event, as it takes a long time for any drive of this nature to mature, it is also in everybody’s interest to set about studying and putting in place the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. Progress in correcting the external imbalance It is in the external sector where the swiftest and sharpest correction of imbalances is being made. The adjustment in the external sector continued in 2012 and, as a result, after posting a surplus in the second half of the year (an unprecedented development since the launch of EMU), the current account was practically in balance, with a deficit of only 0.2% of GDP for the year as a whole. Current forecasts point to surpluses on the current account for 2013, 2014 and successive years. In addition to the contraction in imports attributable to the fall-off in domestic spending, this performance reflects the restoring of the competitiveness lost by the Spanish economy during the expansion that ended in 2008. By late 2012, two-thirds of the gap built up since 2000 between Spanish unit labour costs and those for the euro area on average had already been corrected. These gains in competitiveness have been accompanied, in the most recent period, by notable growth in the number of exporting firms and by greater geographical diversification of our exports, with an ever-increasing weight of those targeted on emerging markets. Competitiveness and market reform To put the favourable external sector performance on a firm footing, we must build on and further the improvements in competitiveness. In this connection, the markets for factors and goods and services must function in a way conducive to containing costs, margins and prices. Clearly, in the labour market, we need a stable employment-promoting regulatory framework which, at the same time, affords sufficient flexibility to attune working conditions to the circumstances of the business cycle. Indeed, greater moderation and flexibility can be seen in wage-setting in recent quarters, as can – and this is also important – a lesser degree of indexation. A more intensive use of the wage and non-wage flexibility mechanisms envisaged in the new regulatory framework would lend continuity to this ongoing improvement in competitiveness. But our problems of lack of flexibility and competition were not and are not only in the labour market. In the market for goods and services, the recently approved National Reform Plan includes a set of measures aimed at removing obstacles to competition, attaining productivity gains in various sectors and improving the functioning of various institutions. Private-sector deleveraging and lending The overindebtedness of households and firms is another of the major problems that arose in the last upturn in the Spanish economy. Private debt/GDP ratios have fallen from their peaks in 2010, but at a relatively slow pace. The main explanation for this sluggishness lies in the downturn in private-sector nominal income since the onset of the crisis. Unlike in other economies with problems of excess household and corporate debt, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, in Spain weak nominal growth has weighed on the process of debt re-balancing and has made it reside, above all, on a contraction in lending. The last year in which lending posted a positive rate of change in Spain was in 2008. Since then, net credit flows, both to households and to non-financial corporations, have been 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  negative overall, although there was a very slight increase in lending to households for house purchase in 2010. In 2012, total lending to the resident non-financial private-sector fell by 5.8%; credit to households fell by 3.7% while that to non-financial corporations decreased by 8%. When total credit to productive activities excluding construction, real estate development and financial services is considered, the decline was not as sharp, standing at 6%. Indeed, credit to productive activities excluding construction, real estate development and financial services was slightly positive in 2010, but has been negative in 2011, 2012 and in 2013 to date. In considering these developments it should evidently be borne in mind that credit for construction and real estate development activities had to shrink as the cyclical upturn ended and the excesses of the period 2004–2008 had to be corrected. The problem naturally lies in the negative rates of credit flow for productive activities other than construction and development, and in the contraction of credit for households, both for house purchases and for other purposes. And, in addition to a problem of volume, there is a problem of prices; our households and firms are paying higher interest rates than the average rates paid for comparable transactions in the euro area as a whole, although these spreads are small in the case of financing for house purchase, very high for consumer loans and also substantial for credit obtained by non-financial corporations. To explain this we must look both at supply-side factors relating to loanable funds by banks, and to demand-side factors on the part of borrowers, households and firms. Concerning the demand for credit, the recessionary environment, high unemployment, the hitherto scant growth prospects and uncertainty are evidently affecting potential borrowers. On the supply side, neither liquidity – provided in a stable fashion and at a low cost by the Eurosystem – nor the shortage of capital would appear to be significant explanatory factors. We believe that on the supply side the two most influential factors are the deleveraging of banks and the lack of projects that may be deemed solvent, or offer sufficient guarantees. There are in fact figures confirming that the most dynamic and productive companies obtain financing; the trajectory of exports is a good indicator in this respect. Yet, at the same time, we know that many small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) – with good results and prospects, and current in their payments to their banks – have difficulty financing even their working capital, or can do so only at a very high cost. There is a further factor affecting credit flows, both on the supply and the demand sides. Our banking map has changed considerably in recent years, with the disappearance or transformation of many savings banks which, in different regions, traditionally lent to many SMEs. That has led to adjustments in bank balance sheets and to new working relationships between credit institutions and their customers, which may, at least temporarily, be influencing credit flows. The need for deleveraging has not only been a consideration for credit institutions, but also for non-financial corporations and households; as earlier stated, both households and firms incurred very high and in many cases unsustainable debt levels in 2008–2010. Indeed, a good number of analysts agree that, in order to expand again, our productive sector is more in need of capital than of credit, given that the correction of excessive debt has not been concluded, without ruling out the fact that, evidently, the pick-up in economic growth may assist this correction. In any event, there can be no economic recovery without a pick-up in credit flows. But the latter cannot ensue from administrative rules that ignore economic rationality or that lead to mistaken decisions from the standpoint of the solvency of banks, including public-sector institutions. That said, there are measures that should be studied to reactivate credit for the entire economy and, in particular, to SMEs and to the exporting sector. The European Investment 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Bank has the means to stimulate loans to SMEs through an increase in its funding to European public-sector banks operating in this area. New arrangements could also be studied for risk-sharing using European funds, for example structural funds, a possibility that is already under discussion. And specific schemes to boost export credit could be studied. Within the Eurosystem, the Banco de España has always been in favour of initiatives geared to supporting more and cheaper credit, through unconventional monetary policy measures that help restore the monetary policy transmission mechanisms. But we know that the normalisation of credit will not come about, or will be slower and difficult, if we do not complete the clean-up and reinforcement of the solvency of our banking system. This is why it is important to clearly understand what has been done in 2012 to overcome the crisis and to evaluate the current state of affairs. Clean-up, recapitalisation and restructuring of the banking system and financial reform I shall focus on the six issues that afford us an overview of the situation: the clean-up efforts in 2012, the strengthening of solvency, the improved liquidity position, developments in non-performing loans, expectations for results in the current year, and, finally, regulatory changes approved in 2012. Clean-up Firstly, balance sheet write-downs. Two steps were taken in 2012 which fundamentally determined the balance sheet write-downs that Spanish banks’ income statements have had to absorb. The first was the requirement, laid down in the royal decrees of February and May 2012, to set aside provisions to reinforce coverage of loans to the real estate development and construction sector and of foreclosed assets. The second was the balance sheet write-downs stemming from the compulsory transfer to SAREB (the asset management company for assets arising from bank restructuring), at an agreed price, of the assets belonging to the balance sheet segments I have just mentioned. This transfer, made by banks under restructuring or resolution, affected assets totalling €107 billion in terms of their gross book value, with a transfer value of €50.6 billion. With this and other measures, Spanish banks’ exposure to the above-mentioned real estate risks has fallen since 2011 by slightly more than half, from €240 billion to €115 billion. In sum, write-downs by Spanish banks in 2012 totalled €87 billion, compared with €32 billion in 2011. Solvency Secondly, solvency. Despite the fact that the major clean-up and provisioning drive by the Spanish banking system in 2012 resulted in total losses of €43.7 billion, the system’s level of solvency has improved. That has been possible thanks to the recapitalisation operations performed by directly tapping the markets; to the capital injection financed through the Financial Assistance Programme agreed with the European authorities, for a final amount of €39 billion; to the conversion of hybrid instruments into capital instruments; and to the funds provided by the FROB and the Deposit Guarantee Fund. Currently, all Spanish banks meet the regulatory capital ratios required. As at the close of the first quarter this year, the solvency ratio of our banking system was 11.6%, compared with the current minimum of 8% required under the Basel Accord. It is worth stressing – as certain comments made seek to omit this or completely misinterpret it – that the fundamental intention and effect of the capital injections with public funds (whether from the European Stability Mechanism or from the Spanish Treasury) has been to prevent the winding-up of banks, thereby preserving customer deposits. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It would be remiss not to mention here the problem of the hybrid capital and subordinated debt instruments sold to retail customers by credit institutions which, following the detection of capital shortfalls in the stress tests completed last September, were unable to cover their capital needs with their own resources and received State aid. These banks, on requiring public financial assistance, are subject to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding signed on 20 July 2012, to Law 9/2012 on the Restructuring and Resolution of Credit Institutions and, consequently, to the European Commission’s arrangements governing State aid. The Banco de España, directly through the FROB and the Deposit Guarantee Fund, and via its participation in the Arbitrage Committee set up last March, is collaborating with the other authorities involved and with the banks themselves to find the best possible solution to this serious and multi-faceted problem; not all these instruments are the same, they have not been sold in the same way, and nor will they be given the same treatment under European regulations. Liquidity Thirdly, liquidity. Spain underwent a serious external funding crisis in 2012. The origins of this crisis lay both in the crisis in the euro area and negative market perception of our banks’ solvency. A feedback loop between sovereign risk and banking risk emerged, dominated by the so-called “redenomination risk”, i.e. the risk that certain countries might abandon the Monetary Union. That led to a very difficult situation for our external funding, which the liquidity supplied by the European Central Bank allowed us to address. In the last quarter of 2012, however, the tensions eased and the liquidity of our banks began to improve. The debit position vis-à-vis the ECB decreased from €410 billion in August 2012 to slightly more than €250 billion last May. Furthermore, the access of our banks to bond markets has improved. NPL ratio Fourth, the NPL ratio. In December 2012, after the initial phase of transfer of assets to the SAREB, the NPL ratio stood at 10.8%. By March it had increased to 11.2%. The real estate development and construction sector has the highest NPL ratio (29%), while that of mortgages to individuals is contained (4%), although it is tending to rise. As a result of the major efforts made in terms of write-downs and provisioning in 2012 and the drastic decrease in real estate risk, we can affirm that our banks are able to meet the provisioning needs which may arise this year, in 2013, and also in 2014, if there are any. Results in 2013 Fifth, the profit and loss account. As we have indicated, in 2012 the large volume of provisioning led to heavy losses. That said, margins performed positively due to the influence of two factors: the fall in interest expenses and the efforts made by many banks to contain their operating costs. Particularly strong efforts have been made by banks which have been restructured in accordance with the plans approved by the FROB, the Banco de España and the European authorities, within the framework of the Memorandum of Understanding of July 2012. As for this year, the preliminary data for the first quarter allow us to be moderately optimistic, since an overall profit of more than €4 billion was reported. Virtually all the banking groups have obtained profits. In short, as the EU institutions, the ECB and the IMF have acknowledged, we are overcoming the banking crisis, although risks and uncertainties persist which mean that we certainly cannot consider the crisis resolved. That said, it needs to be reiterated that there is no better way of normalising credit flows than completing this task. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Regulatory changes Sixth and finally, before discussing the progress made in the Banking Union project, I would like to refer, very briefly, to the most important changes in 2012 in financial regulation which are directly related to the handling of the banking crisis. The most significant legal change in the financial area was Law 9/2012 of 14 November 2012 on the restructuring and resolution of credit institutions which strengthens the FROB’s role and anticipates the future directive which will regulate these processes in Europe. Royal Decree 1559/2012 subsequently regulated asset management companies and, in particular, the regime applicable to the SAREB. Finally, in the area of bank customer protection, mention should be made of Royal Decree-Law 6/2012 of 9 March 2012 which established various measures to protect those mortgage borrowers in most difficulty, which included the Code of Good Practices, to which virtually all Spanish banking institutions adhered. And, second, Banco de España Circular 5/2012 of 27 June 2012 completed the new legislation in this area, developing the concept of “responsible lending” and enhancing the information system applicable to banking products. As for banking supervision, the Banco de España, in compliance with the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding of 20 July 2012, performed an internal review of its supervisory procedures. It created a Committee for this purpose which delivered its findings last October. This Committee made a series of recommendations which the Banco de España is considering and which have already led to changes in the organisational chart of the banking supervision department and in procedures. However, the implementation of the Supervisory Mechanism at the European Central Bank, which we expect to take place in about one year, will clearly involve the need for changes both to supervisory procedures and organisation. Consequently, we need to proceed prudently in this area, our adaptation to the new European model being our first consideration. Progress toward the banking union The decisive push towards banking union was given by the European Summit of June 2012, at a time of grave uncertainty and tensions in the euro area. Banking union must be understood, as conceived from the outset, as an essential step to sever the link between banking risk and sovereign risk and to bolster the soundness and irreversibility of Monetary Union. The banking union will be underpinned by three basic pillars: a single supervisor, harmonised resolution arrangements and a European resolution authority with a common resolution fund. To date, progress has been mixed in each of these three areas. The European Parliament should shortly approve the legislation that creates the single supervisory mechanism, in which the European Central Bank is to play a central role. The single supervisor will become operational twelve months after this approval, but first the ECB must analyse the solvency of all the institutions it is to supervise, an exercise that will have to be incorporated into the new stress tests to be performed by the European Banking Authority next year. The Directive establishing the harmonised resolution regime – currently under debate at the European Council and the European Parliament – and the legislation to create a European authority and a common resolution fund are still pending approval. In the latter case, a proposal must be submitted, on a date yet to be specified, by the European Commission. Conclusions Ladies and Gentlemen, the theme of my speech has been the difficult adjustment that the Spanish economy is currently going through, which needs to be seen in the context of the largely unprecedented international and European setting. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The advanced economies, the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan are operating under extremely loose monetary conditions, with exceptionally abundant liquidity and very low interest rates. Emerging from this situation without any impact on growth and without creating fresh financial turmoil will not be easy and considerable risks will be encountered along that path. Emerging countries continue to record high growth rates, but this momentum is weakening and in 2014 this weakness may become more pronounced. In the euro area in a scenario of weak economic growth and despite the improvement since summer 2012, monetary and financial markets remain fragmented and the uncertainty about monetary union and governance of the European Union has not been completely dispelled. In Spain, we have made significant progress in correcting the imbalances affecting our capacity to grow and I think we are on the right path to achieving a recovery of activity and the creation of employment on a sound basis. However, it will be essential not to abandon the policy of reforms aimed at increasing the flexibility of our economy and at boosting competitiveness. The fundamental task outstanding for the Banco de España is, with the help and close cooperation of the Government and the resolute support of the banking sector, to complete the balance sheet clean-up of our banking system, affording it the utmost solvency, efficiency and transparency. This target, to bring about a system that fulfils its key function to intermediate between savers and investors and which enjoys the full trust of customers and depositors, will, with hard work and rigour, be within our reach. But we will need something more: to restore economic growth, revive investment, create jobs and overcome the banking and financial crisis, we require legal security. I take this opportunity to request that you work resolutely to safeguard and strengthen it. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jörg Asmussen: Intervention in a panel on “The future of Europe” Speech by Mr Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the IIF (Institute of International Finance) 2013 Spring Membership Meeting, Paris, 26 June 2013. *      *      * Mr Prot, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me to speak on this panel. As the central bank of the euro area, Banking Union is of key concern to the ECB. It is essential to increase confidence in the euro area banking sector, to reintegrate financial markets, and to improve the transmission of our monetary policy. It is therefore among the most important issues for the euro area today. While Banking Union comprises a number of regulatory and legislative initiatives, at the moment there are two key priorities. First, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Second, the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), operating under the legal framework established by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). A common deposit guarantee scheme, while important, is something more for the longer-term. Let me say a few words on each of these elements, and how they fit together. Starting with the SSM, we expect the Regulation to be approved by the European Parliament in September and for the ECB to take over supervisory responsibilities one year thereafter. In the meantime, preparatory work is underway involving close cooperation between the ECB and the national authorities that are competent for supervision. The work includes mapping the euro area banking system, developing the supervisory model and, perhaps most topically, preparing the comprehensive assessment of all banks that will come under direct ECB supervision. This is required by the Regulation and will apply to around 130 to 140 banking groups operating in the euro area. The assessment will involve an Asset Quality Review and Balance Sheet Assessment to be conducted by the ECB in the first quarter of 2014. This will then feed into the overall stress test to be conducted by EBA, in cooperation with the ECB, in the second quarter of 2014. Our objective is for the SSM to start with a clean slate and to restore credibility in the European banking sector after two previous stress tests failed to do so. We are therefore aiming for the assessment to be as rigorous as possible. It is clear that the results of the Asset Quality Review and stress test may require recapitalisation or other means of support for weak banks. If banks cannot raise new capital themselves, the fiscal backstops which can be tapped if needed will be national budgets and the existing ESM facilities. Direct bank recapitalisation via the ESM will – with the exception of very rare and unlikely cases – only be available once the SSM is fully operational.  However, building the SSM’s credibility requires more than just transparency on banks’ asset quality. Markets also need to be confident that, in the future, the supervisor can “pull the trigger” on banks that are failing or likely to fail. This means that there must be a mechanism that can wind down banks without causing financial instability. And this is why the SRM is also an essential element of Banking Union. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches In our view, the SRM should comprise of a European resolution authority backed by a single resolution fund. The rationale for this mainly concerns dealing with large, cross-border banks. For resolving these institutions, a central authority that can make swift, impartial decisions is key. Moreover, we need shared resources at the European level to avoid protracted wrangling between national governments on how to share the costs of resolution.  These resources, however, would not come from the taxpayer. The resolution fund would be financed provided by ex ante risk-based levies on the banking sector. In the build-up phase, any public support would be recouped by additional ex post levies on banks. This is consistent with the emerging consensus in Europe, also reflected in the BRRD, that the financial sector itself should pay for the cost of crises. Indeed, when the relevant provisions of the BRRD enter into force, bail-in will be used as the primary tool to recapitalise banks falling below minimum supervisory levels. It is therefore important that we agree on an approach to bail-in that allows some but limited flexibility to ensure financial stability, while still providing an ex ante pecking order and clear rules. Global investors need certainty about the rules of the game in Europe. As regards the date when the BRRD will enter into force, I believe that starting as early as 2015 will provide more clarity and legal certainty for investors than delaying the new regime until 2018. And since market participants will most likely anticipate the new rules even if the later date is chosen, we may as well aim at 2015 for the BRRD to enter into force. Why is a common deposit guarantee scheme not also on the agenda? The reason is that a strong resolution framework lessens the need for it, at least for the medium-term. Under BRRD, banks will have to maintain a minimum level of liabilities that are eligible to be bailed-in, meaning shareholders and creditors will absorb the majority of losses. Moreover, it seems very likely that BRRD will contain a depositor preference rule, with insured deposits given the highest priority. This means that only in extreme cases will deposit guarantee schemes have to pay out. National arrangements, harmonised under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive, should therefore be sufficient. Taken together, these two elements – the SSM and the SRM – form a robust foundation for Banking Union. It is essential that we make progress on each in parallel. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Matthew Elderfield: Central Bank of Ireland’s progress in improving financial regulation and supervision Opening statement by Mr Matthew Elderfield, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the Public Accounts Committee, Dublin, 13 June 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank the Committee for inviting me back to discuss the progress that has been made in improving financial regulation and supervision since I was last here in May 2010, at which time we discussed the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report on the lessons of the financial crisis. There is a lot of ground we could cover, but I think that is best done through our discussion, so let me be extremely brief in my opening remarks. I would like to spend just a few minutes to describe the progress that has been made in three key areas: supervisory capability and approach, regulatory standards and powers and, finally, regulatory philosophy, including the role of enforcement. And then let me just mention one final loose end from the CAG’s Special Report 72, which relates to auditor assurance statements. But can I just sound a note of caution at the outset: while good progress has been made in improving financial regulation and supervision in Ireland, we are by no means all the way there yet. Indeed, as a supervisor you are almost always playing catch up with industry and it is dangerous to think you will get to a point when you can rest on your laurels. So, it is important to maintain the momentum of improvements, to keep the regulatory framework up to date and to ensure supervisory capabilities are always at their best. It’s also especially important to be vigilant against backsliding and attempts to compromise the independence or dilute the diligence of regulation, especially when times start to get good. In terms of supervisory capability and approach, it was clear that supervision was under-resourced in a range of areas and therefore staffing levels have necessarily increased in the last few years. My original estimation was that the regulatory function of the Central Bank would need to be some 725 persons-strong, but based on experience, process improvements and efficiencies, I would think that a target level of around 600 is sensible for the end of the current three year Central Bank Strategy in 2015. Continually striving to improve quality is also important, by ensuring the right mix of experience and investing in training, so that your supervisors have the skills to challenge firms effectively. Ensuring that the Central Bank can attract and retain the skills it needs will no doubt become an increasingly demanding challenge as the market for the relevant specialised skills improves. Six hundred supervisors into more than ten thousand regulated entities requires some strategic choices about resource allocation, which we do through the new risk-assessment framework we have developed called PRISM (probability risk and impact system). This involves an implicit exercise is setting risk appetite, in terms of ensuring adequate resource levels for those firms that pose the biggest potential impact on customers and financial stability should they fail. Our PRISM system also provides a framework for systematically scoring firms on the risk they pose against particular categories (like credit risk or market risk), then communicating these along with a risk mitigation plan – a “to do list” in plain English – for firms to address. This system is new to the Central Bank in the past couple of years and reflects best international practice in how to assess risks in an organised, consistent and systematic manner. This framework does not provide a guarantee that failures will never occur – indeed we should expect that they will continue to do so in smaller firms – but it does mean that we will closely “man mark” the largest firms in order to reduce the risk of their failure. If supervision is about how you police the rules, regulation is about setting the rules themselves. There is a very busy international agenda of regulatory change which is feeding into Ireland via the European Union. I do have some sympathy with industry about the volume of change that is taking place and the challenges that poses for implementation. At a 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  domestic level, the Central Bank has been focused in the initiatives it has taken, with the statutory Code on corporate governance and the new framework for fitness and probity the major changes that impact most sectors. These have helped fill important gaps in regulation. I am also very grateful to successive governments and to the members of this house for the support they have provided in upgrading the supervisory and enforcement powers available to the Central Bank, with legislation in this area close to final adoption. This is a welcome step to improve the regulatory framework. Going forward, it will be important to keep fine tuning the rules based on emerging international best practice. Finally, in this very brief survey, a word about regulatory philosophy. The lessons of the financial crisis are clear, in that supervision and regulation was too light touch. As the IMF says, good supervision is in fact intrusive. And as Patrick Honohan said in his review, supervisors need to be decisive in following through on issues. Our PRISM system is designed to provide a framework that prompts such action; for example we closely track progress against risk mitigation plans. But at the heart of the approach there needs to be a robust regulatory philosophy that encourages challenge: we have described this as “assertive risk based supervision underpinned by a credible enforcement deterrent”. This is designed to put a few concepts front and centre: that we operate a risk-based approach, differentiating based on impact and probability; that there are consequences and accountability for non-compliance; and that our supervisors are empowered to insist upon actions to mitigate risk where we are not satisfied by the explanation from a firm’s management. As today’s session is, I understand, formally designed to help close off the Committee’s review of the CAG’s report into the lessons of the financial crisis, Special Report 72, let me note that there is one loose end in the recommendations that still needs to be concluded, relating to the introduction of auditor assurance statements. We have conducted some preliminary consultation with stakeholders and believe that a risk-based framework, with the obligation applied to the highest impact firms only, is the best and most proportionate way forward. The Central Bank Supervision and Enforcement Bill provides a clear mandate to introduce such assurance requirements, so when the legislation is adopted this can be progressed to a conclusion. There is a lot more ground that we could cover and I am sure more areas the Committee is interested in discussing. This short introduction was by way of highlighting some of the key areas from my perspective. I thank the Committee for its attention and look forward to our discussion and to answering your questions.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sabine Lautenschläger: From supervision to resolution – a German perspective Speech by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger Deputy President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Institute of International and European Affairs, Dublin, 25 June 2013. *      *      * 1.  Introduction Dear Mr Halligan,  ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank you very much for your invitation. It has been my pleasure to come to Dublin to discuss with you those new developments relating to the banking union which are of such great importance to Europe. The title of my remarks refers to the “German perspective”. I would like to talk with you about my vision, and that of the Deutsche Bundesbank. And – I will make no secret of it – I have a case to put before you today. One of James Joyce’s most famous literary characters, Stephen Dedalus, once observed that errors were the portal of discovery. Having failed to prevent the crisis in the first place, policy makers and supervisors alike are at least rightly being called on to learn the right lessons. One of these lessons is the banking union, which was launched in June 2012. The eurozone summit resolved, amongst other things, to transfer banking supervision to the ECB. Further elements were added in December 2012. These include the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) here in the euro area. A single European deposit insurance scheme is also being discussed. Adding a single resolution mechanism to a single supervisory mechanism is, in my opinion, not just a good idea, but one whose time has come. Control and liability should go hand in hand. But a European resolution mechanism likewise needs harmonised standards and instruments, which are currently being developed with the EU’s Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). If I may say so here: the Irish Presidency has distinguished itself admirably during these difficult negotiations. The third pillar of a banking union – a European deposit insurance scheme – is currently not regarded as a priority task. I concur with this view. After all, a deposit insurance scheme is a promise by a government to its depositors to indemnify them to a certain degree in the event of a crisis. A joint deposit insurance scheme would thus necessarily mean joint liability of the member states’ taxpayers. However, joint liability in this area requires joint European control in economic and fiscal policy. And we are nowhere near that stage yet. However, there are more conditions to be met for an effective and efficient banking union, which concern material supervisory legislation: a centralised European supervisory regime requires common supervisory rules. The adoption of the Capital Requirements Regulation and Capital Requirements Directive, and their probable entry into force on 1 January 2014, have brought us a major step closer to a “single rulebook” for banks and supervisors alike. I would also like to give my warmest thanks and congratulations to the Irish Presidency here, too, for their negotiating and organisational skills in this thorny matter, one on which no fewer than four presidencies had to work very hard at that. Well done! 2. Single supervisory mechanism Where do things now stand with regard to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the SSM? Where do I stand? A fundamental political consensus has been achieved. A formal resolution in Germany is still pending, however, as this significant transfer of powers requires a two-thirds majority in each of Germany’s two houses of parliament. The required majority 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  was reached in the Bundestag, or lower house, on 14 June 2013; the Bundesrat, or upper house, will vote on 5 July 2013. I trust that everything will go smoothly, and that the Single Supervisory Mechanism Regulation will enter into force in the late summer so that, in the second half of 2014, the European Central Bank (ECB) can start supervising banks in cooperation with national supervisors. I expect major benefits from the forthcoming European cross-border supervision of banks. The last five years, in particular, have brutally shown us that crises do not stop at national borders, especially in a monetary union. An advantage of the SSM is that it will draw on a broader and better basis of information across the eurozone, thereby making it possible to reveal undesirable developments more quickly. If designed correctly, with a strong arm in benchmarking and peer review, we can uncover trends in individual business lines and risk management much sooner in future. I also expect this to be a major step towards the consistent application of the supervisory rules, as a second pillar of the single rulebook, so to speak. I am hoping that European supervision, in teams of supervisors from various nations, will provide a new approach which incorporates the best elements of each nation’s approach to supervision. This new approach will leave no room for a “home biased” supervisory regime. However, the SSM also has some major weaknesses, and I would like to single one out for particular emphasis. It has to do with the fact that the final say on central decisions taken by the ECB – and thus also in the SSM – rests with the Governing Council of the ECB. It is true that these decisions will be prepared in a Supervisory Board, composed of representatives of all eurozone national supervisory authorities and central banks, and that the Governing Council of the ECB can only accept or reject the proposals. A mediation panel would resolve disagreements. However, the Governing Council would have ultimate responsibility no matter what. I have misgivings about this setup, for two reasons. First: this governance structure is quite complex, and its functional viability still needs to be demonstrated. I admit that I side with the sceptics here. Second: it will not be possible here to draw a clear dividing line between monetary policy and supervision: the Single Supervisory Mechanism Regulation only goes as far as EU primary law allows. I therefore see the ECB facing conflicting aims: price stability and a stable banking system. This conflict of aims can threaten the ECB’s “internal independence”. Over the medium to long term, I believe it is necessary to put the SSM on a sound legal footing; there is no getting around changes to primary law to improve the governance structure and to draw a clear line between the monetary and supervisory functions. I am convinced that we need to tackle the issue of these changes. 3. Single resolution mechanism Let me now turn to my second main topic for today: the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The financial market crisis has shown us the magnitude of the hazards and costs associated with buzzwords such as “too big” or “too complex to fail”. The G20 governments have therefore committed to take measures to prevent taxpayers from having to bail out distressed banks. The onus is now on policymakers and supervisors to develop a bank resolution and restructuring process. This issue takes on a new dimension in the context of joint supervision. After all, within a cross-border supervisory structure, there also has to be a common restructuring and resolution regime in order to achieve a balance between liability and control. To that end, we have to establish a central European resolution agency and a joint European resolution fund. In order to make such a single European restructuring and resolution regime lawsuit-proof, a change to primary law is required here, too. In my view, the current legal framework for the establishment of a special resolution authority for the euro area, with extensive powers of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  intervention, is insufficient. As a European resolution authority will have extensive powers to intervene, its legal basis must be absolutely watertight. Resolution will invariably be followed by lawsuits – that much is certain. What shape should such a resolution authority take in practice? Transferring the relevant tasks to the EU Commission, limited to only a subset of member states, and even if just for a transitional period, is not a really good idea. It harbours legal pitfalls: restricting the authority’s powers to the euro area is hardly covered by Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and also poses the threat of conflicts of interest. Resolution and state aid would be merged into one single authority. As in the context of the SSM, in this area, too, policy makers are called upon to tackle with determination the task of laying the groundwork under EU primary legislation for an independent resolution authority. 4. Hierarchy of liability What other unfinished business is there? Well, there is, above all, the issue of the instruments and procedures to be applied when a bank is to be resolved or restructured. At all events, the resolution and restructuring of a bank supervised directly by the ECB requires common instruments and procedures, which will also benefit EU countries which join the SSM. I therefore welcome the Irish Presidency’s efforts to push ahead with the highly complex and controversial BRRD dossier. The crucial precondition to finalising this dossier is agreeing on who will ultimately foot the bill. To this end, we need to define the hierarchy of liability clearly and ex ante: Shareholders should be the first to bear losses; if that does not suffice we must not hesitate to bail in junior and senior debt holders as well – at least most of the time. The big issue is currently whether or not deposits should be put in a class of their own in the hierarchy of liability – in other words, should there be a “depositor preference”. Some member states also want all deposits, or at least those insured up to €100,000, to be exempted from a bail-in. A privately financed resolution fund is a further line of defence. All banks supervised directly by the ECB would have to contribute to this joint European resolution fund, which would supersede national regimes in the medium term. This fund should also be able to require additional payments from member banks. Every now and then, I hear the notion that the Eurosystem could also make a contribution, for instance, by providing bridge loans. I don’t think that’s a good idea. True, a central bank can provide emergency liquidity – but only if a bank is suffering from temporary liquidity shortages. However, it may not, and should not, contribute aid towards resolution or restructuring, as this can easily cross the line into fiscal policy. As a last resort, however, the fund could request public financial assistance for example, from the ESM, as there could be threats which, in extraordinary cases, could require recourse to public funding. 5. Direct recapitalisation through the ESM Public funds is a buzzword and a hot-button issue, one that is inseparably linked to the question: who is the public that is supposed to be doing the funding? Should nation-states be called to pay up whenever a crisis occurs, or should there be a joint European fund? I see no compelling reasons why the costs of bank restructuring should be shifted entirely to the European level. You see: the weal and woe of a bank depends not only on the competence of its management but also on external factors: the quality of supervision; the financial and economic strength of its borrowers, which in turn hinges on a nation’s economic policy; and also the fiscal policy of the country where a bank is based. Ample proof of this assertion is 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  provided by the fact that a bank’s funding costs are dependent on the sovereign credit rating of its home country. Although we will be centralising supervision in Europe next year, other factors such as economic and fiscal policy will remain largely the responsibility of individual nations. And, as long as that is the case, the arguments for shifting losses completely to the European level do not appear to be compelling. The Balance Sheet Assessment provided for by Article 27 of the SSM Regulation also acquires major significance in this context: this article requires the ECB to assess the portfolio quality of the banks it will be supervising in future. What the regulation does not say, however, is what happens if hidden losses are disclosed. I have two things to say about this. I consider the Balance Sheet Assessment to be very important. For it to be successful, we should base our assessments of banks’ balance sheets not only on supervisors’ judgements. We should also enlist outside specialists – external auditors – for a quantitative assessment. Not only in order to restore market participants’ confidence in the European banking industry, but also to minimise reputational risk for the ECB. All supervisors in Europe are familiar with ad hoc examinations. These are precisely the instruments we should be using here. This is the only way we can avert the suspicion of national supervisors taking too much account of national special circumstances. My other remark follows on directly: it concerns the legacy risks of banks supervised under the SSM. As these risks were created in the past, under the responsibility of individual member states, they should be borne in a national context, too. 6. Changes to primary law I have twice mentioned changes to primary law in the context of the banking union: once referring to the SSM and again with regard to the SRM. I am indeed aware that many are recoiling at the thought of changing primary law, as it is a long and winding road. Ultimately, however, the project of creating a banking union is similar to the creation of the single monetary policy. And, we did things properly then and started by establishing a sound legal foundation. If it was good enough for establishing a monetary union, it will be good enough for a banking union. That notwithstanding, I think the SSM and a restructuring and resolution mechanism should be launched prior to changing EU primary law. However, we should start working on amendments to primary law right away, given the foreseeable difficulties and the amount of time this endeavour will probably take. 7. Significance of the single supervisory mechanism to the Bundesbank While I am here with you today, the ECB is visiting my colleagues at the Bundesbank to put on a “road show” extolling its virtues as an employer. As Goethe’s Faust put it: “Two souls, alas! are dwelling in my breast” – as much as I look forward to a single supervisory mechanism, to the success of which many of my fellow Bundesbankers will be instrumental, I will be very, very sorry to have to do without them at the Bundesbank. The SSM, after all, is designed in such a manner that the quality and expertise of national supervisors will continue to be the decisive factor. This constituent of the EU – the principle of subsidiarity – will have a place in the banking union, too. Nonetheless, themes relating to banks and their supervision and resolution will acquire a new European dimension. And, as long as it is done well, this is as it should be. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Stable euro, strong Europe Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the Wirtschaftstag 2013, Berlin, 25 June 2013. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to speak to you today. And I am grateful for the invitation from the Wirtschaftsrat, an institution grounded on the principles of the Soziale Marktwirtschaft in the tradition of Ludwig Erhard. In a speech here in Berlin just 18 months ago, I quoted Erhard’s famous dictum: “Die soziale Marktwirtschaft ist ohne eine konsequente Politik der Preisstabilität nicht denkbar”. So I am happy to accept our host’s invitation to reflect on the importance of a stable euro and a strong Europe. All policy-makers can and should contribute to preserving the stability of our common currency and to building a stronger and more prosperous Europe. I would like to emphasise my personal commitment to this goal. I am confident that through our joint efforts to complete the institutional architecture of economic and monetary union (EMU), we can serve this collective mission. The European Central Bank (ECB) has an unambiguous mandate against which our performance can be measured: medium-term price stability, understood as an average annual inflation rate of just below 2%. The ECB’s task and track record With this objective, we are continuing for 17 countries what the Deutsche Bundesbank achieved for Germany. Our history is younger, but it is with some pride that I say that the ECB has accomplished this objective for almost 15 years. And it is with emphasis that I say that we are committed to taking the exact same objective into the future. The euro’s track record demonstrates the ECB’s success in attaining this objective. According to our projections, by the end of 2014, the average annual inflation rate since the start of the euro will decline to 1.97%. This inflation record over such a long period is well below those recorded in any larger country now part of the euro area in the half-century preceding the euro and also compares very well in an international context. The ECB’s track record is therefore remarkable. Our commitment to taking the exact same objective forward is reflected in inflation expectations. They confirm that the currency is stable. Survey- and market-based measures of inflation expectations are firmly anchored at levels consistent with our definition of price stability. In the spirit of Ludwig Erhard, the ECB is making its contribution to the social market economy. The ECB’s response and instruments Having the same objective does not necessarily mean using the same instruments. The ECB has inherited its objective from the Bundesbank, but it is operating in a new and different environment. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Today’s economic and monetary union is larger and more diverse than a single country, such as Germany. It is highly integrated but still at times fragmented. And it comprises a very large number of policy-makers on fiscal, structural and other economic matters. All policy-makers have to recognise that we belong to EMU together and that policies as well as policy inaction create spillovers for other members. This is an enormous responsibility for governments and other economic policy-makers. For the ECB to operate in this environment, and to be responsible and effective in accomplishing its objective, we have to use a wide range of instruments. Some instruments are standard, some non-standard, but all are based on the ECB Statutes. The use of these instruments has been essential in safeguarding our objective during the financial and sovereign debt crisis. In the run-up to the crisis, inappropriate fiscal, structural and other economic policies fostered an excessive build-up of risk in the financial sector and created vulnerabilities on a global scale. When the crisis erupted, these vulnerabilities placed a heavy burden on central banks. In particular, the threat of a financial meltdown jeopardised their capability to counteract downside risks to price stability. The ECB acted on that threat according to our unambiguous mandate to deliver price stability. We have reduced our main policy rates to historical lows. This contributed to stabilising investment and consumption decisions in the euro area. Our actions prevented a steeper fall in aggregate demand and ensured the conditions for stable prices in the euro area. In a bank-based economy like the euro area, monetary policy works through banks, and banks lend to each other, based on mutual trust. In the crisis, that trust got lost, and the banks no longer lent to each other. Facing the threat of a euro-area wide funding crisis, they turned to the central bank. We, the central bank, provided liquidity to banks because we have to work through them. They are our counterparts – and we had to act. There was no guarantee that the liquidity provided would all end up in the real economy but because we acted, we avoided an even larger credit crunch and a collapse of parts of the banking system. We designed our instruments so as to provide long-term credit to banks and give them reassurance that they could satisfy their liquidity needs over an extended period. This gave banks a clear funding perspective and put them in a position to provide credit lines to the real economy, in line with their business assessment of credit risks. ECB policy responses over the past 12 months By mid-2012, the crisis took a new turn. We saw the risk of a complete collapse of all credit markets. Risks to fiscal sustainability and growing market distrust in some euro area countries started to spill over into their respective banking sectors. Close links between sovereigns and banks threatened the stability of the entire banking sector in some countries. While impairments to the transmission of monetary policy eased in some countries, they became entrenched and more acute in others. Fractures in transmission – a new phenomenon since the start of EMU – appeared along national borders. Investors suddenly lost confidence that the euro area could survive in its current composition. In fact, the prospect that claims on certain governments and private companies in certain countries could not be discharged in euros had become a possibility. International investors started divesting securities issued by governments of non-core economies and of private institutions domiciled in those countries. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Germany became the destination of “safe-haven” flows. Capital, deposits and central bank liquidity were leaving the periphery and concentrating in the core. Market interest rates in Germany fell as bond prices were driven upwards, and at some point, German bond market rates were lower than ECB refinancing rates! At the same time, the loss of liquidity and bank funding capacity in the periphery produced a tightening of credit conditions in those economies. Interest rates for bank customers, firms and households were dropping in the core and rising in the periphery. Eventually, the fragmentation of financial conditions became so severe that we were effectively losing the steering ability of our monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. In this environment, we once again had to act. As our main instrument, we announced the programme of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) in secondary government bond markets. The aim is to eliminate redenomination risk, namely uncertainty about the survival of the euro. Since OMT was announced almost one year ago, its benefits have been widely acknowledged. The glut of liquidity in core economies has been partly reabsorbed, as deposits and savings have returned to the periphery. Interest rates in Germany have increased and they have fallen in the periphery. Target balances, a powerful summary indicator of fragmentation, have come down by one quarter from their peak last year. Funding costs in the countries under stress have fallen substantially. Both banks and firms in stressed countries have been able to regain access to market financing, both for funding and raising capital. Our initiative has therefore been beneficial to all: banks, companies and households – and it has benefited both periphery and core countries. Let me highlight a few features of OMT that are essential to bear in mind. First, OMT comes with strict and effective conditionality attached to a programme with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The initiative is activated only if a country submits to policy conditionality that leads to policy reforms. Governments are not presented with a choice between reforms or OMT. OMT comes only with reforms. And reforms need a disciplined process of monitoring and international surveillance for the country concerned. Otherwise, there is no OMT activation. Second, conditionality enhances the independence and the effectiveness of our monetary policy. The reason is that conditionality is a necessary but not sufficient condition to activate OMT. We would only act if the right conditions for effective use of this monetary policy instrument were in place. Third, the ECB would not act to compress spreads artificially; on the contrary, we believe that spreads should naturally reflect the underlying fiscal position of the sovereign and the economic prospects of the country. This is also why we emphasised that a sovereign needs to have market access to qualify for OMT. Fourth, OMT does not entail a transfer of risks from periphery to core countries via the ECB’s balance sheet, over and beyond risks that are inevitable and inherent in the implementation of a single monetary policy for 17 sovereign states. The OMT announcement has lowered risks for core countries: the risks of a euro area break-up; the risks arising from Target balances in such a scenario; and the risks from market interest rates distorted by safe-haven flows. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Because of OMT, the euro area is a more stable and resilient place to invest in than it was a year ago. Indeed, I would say that OMT is even more essential now as we see potential changes in the monetary policy stance with associated uncertainty in other jurisdictions of the integrated global economy. Essential reforms going forward So where do we stand? In terms of monetary policy, price stability is assured, and the overall economic outlook still warrants an accommodative stance. We see some signs of stabilisation in sentiment, even though uncertainties remain. And we expect that monetary stimulus and improvements in financial markets will support a recovery later in the year. The situation has improved; fragmentation has receded; and tentative signs of stabilisation have occurred. But monetary policy is only a small part of the overall policy agenda for overcoming the crisis and laying the foundations for sustainable growth and renewed employment creation. Governments, social partners and other important economic decision-makers have to live up to their responsibilities, too. One key issue is structural reform to make euro area economies more business friendly and more competitive in the global economy. There is a host of indicators – from the Global Competitiveness indicators to the Ease of Doing Business indicators – that lay out the reform agenda in no uncertain terms: only a handful of euro area countries rank highly on these indicators. Germany is among them, thanks to the resolute structural reforms implemented in this country ten years ago. These reforms are an inspiration for other countries. Many European countries have structural problems: it takes longer to get licenses, permits and other administrative authorisations than in other countries; the judicial system is slower; and regulation is more complex. Structural reforms may hurt a few vested interests, but they would clearly strengthen the effectiveness, competitiveness and, yes, also the fairness of our economies. Another key issue is growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. We have to be mindful that debt-based fiscal spending is no way to growth. Euro area government debt has risen by almost 20 percentage points of GDP in the last 15 years and by over 50 percentage points in the last 30 years. At the same time, growth has fallen, from 3.8% on average in the 1970s to 2.1% in the 1990s and roughly zero now. Debt spending has not avoided the stagnation of economic growth. But fiscal consolidation can be made much more growth-friendly by cutting unproductive expenditures, by establishing credible and detailed medium-term fiscal plans and by lowering the tax burden where it is harming economic activity and job creation in particular. The third key issue is ensuring a sound financial system. This is where current efforts to establish a European banking union are crucial. The aim of the banking union is to establish transparency, stability and incentive-compatibility in the euro area financial market. Conclusion I have outlined what we at the ECB have been doing – and what needs to be done in other key domains of European economic policy. The June 2012 summit was so important because in times of great uncertainty it provided a clear vision of what is necessary for a stable and genuine economic and monetary union. Much of it is being implemented. And I am confident that the project for Europe will continue

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jean-Pierre Danthine: Swiss banks from a financial stability perspective Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Vice Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the media news conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 20 June 2013. *      *      * As my colleague Thomas Jordan has explained, economic and financial conditions for the Swiss banking sector continue to be challenging. Against this background, I would like to examine the situation at Swiss banks from a financial stability perspective, looking first at the big banks and then moving on to a discussion of domestically focused banks. Big banks: strengthening resilience Over the past year, the Swiss big banks have substantially improved their capital situation. Risk-weighted capital ratios have been raised markedly, and both banks are now very well placed in an international peer comparison. Moreover, with its capital-building, Credit  Suisse has also raised its leverage ratio considerably. Measured in terms of loss-absorbing capital – defined as Common Equity Tier 1 capital plus high-trigger contingent capital instruments – leverage ratios at the big banks are now at roughly the same level.  However, given the prevailing risks in the environment and the losses incurred in the recent crisis, the SNB still considers current leverage ratios at the Swiss big banks to be low. In addition, a number of comparative studies imply that, in terms of leverage ratios, UBS and Credit Suisse are currently below the international average. The big banks’ published plans on strategy and capital-building envisage a further improvement in their capital situation. According to these plans, and measured in terms of loss-absorbing capital, by the end of 2014, Credit Suisse and UBS are likely to have already met the risk-weighted capital requirement of 13% which will apply from 2019. Moreover, these plans will lead to a substantial increase in their leverage ratios by the end of 2014. The SNB acknowledges the big banks’ progress to date and recommends that they consistently and fully implement their plans, in order to further strengthen their resilience and, in particular, to improve their leverage ratios. Improving the leverage ratio is all the more crucial given the growing importance of this indicator as a measure of banks’ resilience. Credibility of model-based risk-weighted assets The risk weighting of assets plays a key role in determining the capital requirement for a bank. All of the bank’s on and off-balance-sheet positions are multiplied by a risk weight. The riskier the position, the higher the weight. The figure for risk-weighted assets (RWA) represents the sum of these risk-weighted positions. Required capital, in turn, is defined as a percentage of RWA. There are two different approaches for setting risk weights. Under the standardised approach, risk weights are prescribed for broad asset classes. Under the model-based approach, by contrast, banks can use their own internal models to determine the risk weights for different assets. The credibility of RWA based on banks’ internal models is increasingly being called into question by market participants, analysts and authorities worldwide. It is widely accepted that a bank’s risks can, in principle, be more accurately quantified using the model-based approach than using the standardised approach. Yet banks’ internal models are extremely complex and can vary widely between banks, owing to the use of different model choices and model parameters. This can result in different capital requirements for banks with a similar asset structure. This makes it difficult to accurately assess a bank’s resilience, and to compare one bank with another. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches To increase the usefulness and credibility of the model-based approach, in-depth analyses need to be carried out to determine whether and to what extent the model-based approach and the standardised approach lead to differences in RWA. The standardised approach does have shortcomings. Yet, since it is independent of bank-specific modelling assumptions, it provides market participants with an additional point of reference for assessing both the level of and changes in model-based RWA. Differences between the two approaches must be well explained and have a sound economic rationale. If the analysis does not reveal any substantial inexplicable differences, this will strengthen market confidence in the model-based approach. Otherwise, appropriate measures should be considered. This could, for instance, entail setting a floor for some model-based RWA, such as that recently introduced for banks in the US. Another option would be to introduce a multiplier on model-based risk weights for specific positions, as already imposed by FINMA for some mortgage loans. Efforts are underway at FINMA, supported by the SNB, to analyse potential differences between the two approaches. In this context, the SNB recommends that the big banks increase transparency with regard to their risks. This includes, among other things, publishing their internal measures of total risk. Disclosing RWA according to the standardised approach in addition to model-based RWA would likewise lead to greater transparency with regard to risks. Greater transparency would help to make changes in model-based RWA easier to understand, and thereby increase the credibility of the model-based approach. Domestically focused banks: resilience and lending policies I would now like to turn to our assessment of domestically focused commercial banks. At present, the risks for these banks are primarily linked to the situation and momentum on mortgage and real estate markets. In an environment of historically low interest rates, there has been a build-up of imbalances on these markets. On the one hand, the ratio of mortgage loans to GDP has increased to very high levels in a historical comparison. On the other, growth in real estate prices has been persistently stronger than what can be explained by fundamental factors. Owing to these developments, measures were announced in June 2012 to reduce risks in the Swiss mortgage market. These measures include a revision of the self-regulation rules for mortgage lending and stricter capital requirements for mortgage loans. Despite the measures taken, however, imbalances continued to build up in 2012. Against this background, the Federal Council decided in February 2013 to activate the countercyclical capital buffer, at the proposal of the SNB. In the light of this risk situation, the fact that the capitalisation of domestically focused banks is significantly above the regulatory minimum requirements is a welcome development. Indeed, compared to the previous year, these banks have even improved their regulatory capitalisation slightly. Moreover, most domestically focused banks already meet FINMA’s capital buffer requirements, which go beyond Basel III. However, figures on regulatory capital may overestimate the true resilience of these banks. For one thing, the risks in the real estate market in particular are not or only partly taken into account in the regulatory capital requirements. For another, neither interest rate risk nor the low diversification of these banks – whose activities are centred on the domestic mortgage market – are fully reflected in the capital requirements. These aspects are currently of particular importance for three reasons. First, as already mentioned, mortgage and real estate markets have seen a further build-up of risks since June 2012. Second, there has been further significant growth in mortgage lending at domestically focused banks. Although growth momentum has declined year-on-year, the volume of mortgage claims at these banks has increased by around 5%. Third, banks’ risk appetite in lending has remained persistently high. For instance, a large proportion of new 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 mortgages granted for owner-occupied residential property still have a loan-to-value ratio of over 80%. Furthermore, the share of new loans with stretched affordability has also remained at a high level. At the same time, the interest rate margin of domestically focused banks narrowed further in 2012, while interest rate risk remained historically high. In view of the persistently low level of interest rates, there is the risk that, despite the measures already implemented, imbalances on the Swiss mortgage and real estate markets will continue to build up. This would increase both the likelihood and the consequences of a price correction in the medium term. Such a price correction could be triggered, for example, by a sharp increase in interest rates. Against this background, domestically focused banks should therefore continue to ensure that their resilience is sufficiently high, irrespective of the regulatory requirements, and make adjustments where necessary. They should be able to maintain their economically important functions, even if real estate prices were to fall sharply and interest rates were to simultaneously rise. In particular, domestically focused banks should make sure that the currently high direct interest rate risk is assessed and managed using conservative assumptions. In this context, the assumptions applied by banks with regard to savings and sight deposits are especially important. In an environment of historically low interest rates, these deposits have proven to be very stable sources of financing in recent years. This does not mean, however, that the situation will remain stable in the future. Were the general level of interest rates to rise, these funds could quickly flow elsewhere. Banks should therefore include these assumptions in their assessment and management of their interest rate risk. Furthermore, domestically focused banks should exercise greater caution in residential mortgage lending. When determining and applying their lending criteria with respect to loan-to-value ratios, banks should bear in mind that the risks in the real estate market have increased. Moreover, when assessing the affordability for their borrowers, banks should be aware that mortgage rates can rise rapidly. The application of conservative lending criteria is important, on the one hand, as a precautionary measure for the banks themselves, in view of the prevailing risks in the market. On the other, a more prudent lending policy would help to counter a further build-up of imbalances. From a financial stability perspective, in the event of a further build-up of risks in the Swiss mortgage and real estate markets, it might prove necessary to take further regulatory measures. The SNB, for its part, will regularly assess whether an adjustment of the countercyclical capital buffer is necessary.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Benoît Cœuré: Duration risk in the financial system Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at “The Global Borrowers and Investors Forum 2013 – a Euromoney Conference”, London, 25 June 2013. *      *      * I wish to thank Gerhard Rünstler, Christoffer Kok and Matthias Sydow for their contributions to these remarks. I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein. Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here at this Euromoney conference. Today I’d like to consider the impact that volatile interest rates may have on the financial system.  Let me state quite clearly that I do not intend to drop any hints about a change in the monetary policy stance in the euro area in the near future. A reversal would not be warranted by current economic conditions. Economic growth is projected to remain weak this year and inflation is expected to remain clearly below 2% for the euro area as a whole. The various non-standard measures that have been introduced by the ECB to support monetary policy transmission in certain market segments will stay in place as long as necessary, and there are other measures, standard and non-standard, that we can deploy if warranted. Therefore, at the current juncture, there should be no doubts that our “exit” is distant and our monetary policy is and will remain accommodative. However, these conditions are not permanent; interest rates will eventually increase, triggered by a tightening of the monetary policy stance, by an unwinding of global risk appetite, and/or by other external events. The recent bout of volatility in global fixed income markets is excessive in view of the current economic conditions, but it can serve as a useful reminder that such developments cannot be dismissed lightly.  In fact, since the Great Depression a number of financial crises have occurred after a prolonged period of exceptionally easy monetary conditions. Some of you may remember the events of 1994, when even a gradual shift in the monetary policy after a low-rate period triggered severe turbulence on bond markets. For the United States, this concern was raised in a recent speech by Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein.1 He concluded that there are signs of a fairly significant pattern of “reaching-for-yield” behaviour in US corporate credit markets. However, he also commented that leverage in the short-term financing of credit remained modest and therefore the potential for systemic harm would be relatively limited. These developments trigger several questions: First, what are the channels through which a low interest rate environment can affect the financial system’s exposure to risk? Second, how sensitive are the balance sheets of euro area financial institutions to duration risk? Third, how should regulatory and macroprudential policies be designed to avoid the negative implication of rising interest rates? And what can be the role of standard and non-standard monetary policies to mitigate unwarranted volatility along the road?  I will structure my remarks along the following lines. First, I want to review some of the recent literature on the relationship between monetary policy and the risk-taking behaviour of financial institutions, the so-called risk-taking channel of monetary policy. Second, I will present some evidence on the on-going search for yield in corporate bond markets. Third, I will also address specific challenges related to the fragmentation of the euro area financial markets. Fourth, I will draw upon forward-looking solvency analysis results published in the ECB’s most recent Financial Stability Review to discuss some of the consequences of                                                  1  See Stein, J. C., 2013, Overheating in Credit Markets: Origins, Measurement, and Policy Responses, speech held at a research symposium at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 7 February 2013. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches various risks related to a re-emergence of risk aversion in several market segments. Finally, I will discuss the policy implications.  The risk-taking channel of monetary policy One concern arising from a low interest rates environment is that the associated search-for-yield may induce excessive risk-taking behaviour by financial institutions. The recent crisis has rekindled the idea that prolonged lax monetary policy can lead to financial instability what has been termed “the risk-taking channel” of monetary policy. There are four broad arguments which I would like to briefly discuss: asset substitution, search for yield, pro-cyclical leverage, and expectations of monetary policy reaction.2  The asset substitution argument derives from standard portfolio theory, and it holds that a lower yield on safe assets will lead to a decrease in their weight in bank portfolios. Banks adjust their portfolio until risk-adjusted returns on risky and safe investments are again equalised. This results in a lower share of safe assets.  A related mechanism operates through the search for yield. Financial institutions with long-term commitments (such as pension funds and insurance companies) need to match the yield they promised on their liabilities with the return on their assets. When interest rates are high, they can generate the necessary revenue by investing in safe assets. When rates are low, they are forced to invest in riskier assets to continue to match the yield on their liabilities.3   Assume now that financial institutions target constant or perhaps even pro-cyclical leverage ratios. If monetary easing boosts asset prices, then bank equity will increase and banks will respond to the fall in leverage by increasing their demand for assets. This reaction reinforces the initial boost to asset values, and so on. The result of this “leverage channel” is a more fragile banking system.4  Finally, monetary policy could also affect risk-taking through the expectation of a strong policy response to negative shocks. Since the 1990s, central banks have repeatedly provided liquidity to financial markets following market tensions. This channel has sometimes been called the “Greenspan put”. Of course, it can be objected that the asymmetric pattern of booms and busts in asset prices prompts an asymmetric monetary policy response. But it remains true that central bank liquidity provision, while necessary in crisis time, can distort the price signals and therefore the incentives of financial market participants. Financial players can afford to take ex ante extra risks, as they can rely on central banks to mitigate the consequences in case those risks materialise ex post.  The bottom line of these four arguments is that lax monetary policy has the potential to reduce the market price of risk and thereby trigger a higher degree of risk-taking by financial institutions. Some recent empirical studies by ECB staff members lend support to these ideas.5,6                                                  2  See, e.g., de Nicolò G. et al., 2010, Monetary Policy and Bank Risk Taking, IMF research department mimeo. 3  See Rajan, R.G., 2005, Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier? Proceedings, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, August, 313–69. 4  See Adrian T. and Shin H.J., 2009, Money, Liquidity. and Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No 360. 5  One study used the volatility index (VIX) to test for the dynamic links between monetary policy, stock market volatility and risk aversion. It finds that lax monetary policy decreases risk aversion in the stock market after about nine months. This effect is persistent, lasting for more than two years. Moreover, monetary policy shocks appear to account for a significant proportion of variation in risk aversion. See Hoerova M., Bekaert G., Lo Duca M., 2013, Risk, Uncertainty and Monetary Policy, Journal of Monetary Economics, forthcoming. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Of course, under certain circumstances, reducing the market price of risk and freeing up the risk-taking capacity of financial institutions is actually an outcome desired by monetary policy. Consider, for instance, the various non-standard monetary policies undertaken globally after the financial crisis broke out in 2009. They were designed to remove risk from balance sheets so as to avoid destructive fire sales and at the same time to enable banks to continue providing credit to the real economy by taking new risks.  The concern is, however, that persistent liquidity sows the seeds for market turmoil. Unexpected events such as a shift in monetary policy or a change in economic growth prospects will inevitably affect the yield curve. Since banks carry out maturity transformation by borrowing short and lending long, and there are limits to their ability to hedge against interest rate risk, the result could well be an abrupt unwinding of risk-taking positions, putting financial market under renewed stress. These risks are further exacerbated by the fact that banks operating under asymmetric information and limited liability will tend to take more risk than is socially optimal, since they do not internalise the losses they may eventually impose on taxpayers. A clear and consistent framework for bank recovery and resolution, including “bail-in” rules with a clear pecking order and limited exemptions, will be conducive to a stricter monitoring of risks by bank creditors.  In fact, as I mentioned before, many of the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression broke out after prolonged periods of exceptionally easy monetary conditions. Apart from the 2009 financial crisis, similar developments occurred in relation to the burst of the New Economy bubble in 2001, the collapse of LTCM in 1998, and the burst of the bond market bubble in 1994. Search for yield in bond markets Let me now turn to the current situation by showing you some evidence on the search for yield in the euro area, taking corporate bond markets as an example. (CHART 1) Let me start with some recent developments in European bond markets. Since early 2012, we have seen pronounced shifts towards bond holdings in investment funds and a general decline in yields across all risk categories. As Chart 1 shows, equity holdings of euro area investment funds slightly declined compared with 2011, whereas net flows into fixed income funds increased substantially.  (CHART 2) As in the US, the search for yields in corporate bond markets in the euro area has intensified in recent months: corporate bond spreads are at historical lows. Chart 2 compares the historical evolution of yields on high-yield bonds with default probabilities. Yields are generally back to pre-crisis levels, but default probabilities are still significantly higher. One noticeable exception is provided by German corporate bonds, which have reverted to low default probabilities. The decline in yields of high-yield bonds is even more remarkable as the supply of those bonds has been shooting up recently. Total issuance of euro area non-financial corporate debt in 2012 was 60% higher than issuance in 2011, and it remained strong in the first months of this year. The share of high-yield debt in total issuance rose from one-quarter in 2012 to one-third in the first quarter of 2013, above the average recorded from 2006 to 2012.  Overall the evidence for the euro area on corporate bonds parallels the one for the US and the two markets appear closely linked to each other. As I have discussed before, an abrupt                                                                                                                                                       6  Another study found similar effects for loans. Low short-term interest rates soften credit standards for household and corporate loans, but especially for mortgages. This softening can be amplified by securitisation activity and weak supervision of bank capital and is more pronounced if policy rates remain low for a prolonged period. See Maddaloni, A. and Peydró, J.-L., 2012, Bank risk-taking, securitization and low interest rates, ECB Working Paper No 1248. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches unwinding of these searches-for-yield – perhaps triggered by highly leveraged investors rushing for the exit – would be a source of concern for financial stability. However, the extent of the risk also depends on the degree of maturity transformation and the stability of funding.  Specific challenges in the euro area  The unwinding of search-for-yield may emerge as a global phenomenon. However, there are specific issues related to the current heterogeneity of economic and financial conditions in the euro area. Let me focus on government bond and money markets. (CHART 3) Euro area government bond markets have appeared resilient recently. The dispersion of yields was low in the first quarter of 2013, and volatility remained close to its 2009 (pre-sovereign debt crisis) levels. Pivotal developments in reversing the deteriorating trend in confidence included the ECB’s announcements on the Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) programme and European leaders’ commitment to establishing a banking union, along with noteworthy national developments, including the recapitalisation and restructuring of the Spanish banking sector.  These are all positive developments, but there is certainly no room for complacency. Progress towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union should be confirmed along the lines of President Van Rompuy’s report, starting with clear and predictable rules for bank resolution and with the establishment of a single resolution mechanism, complementing the single supervisory mechanism as the second pillar of the banking union.  The continuation of the current low level of government bond spreads cannot be taken for granted, and countries efforts towards sustainable fiscal positions should thus continue unabated. A sudden re-pricing of risks may lead to an increase in spreads, despite the on-going fiscal consolidation efforts, and even more so in countries where consolidation has been delayed.7 This would put renewed pressures on governments and revive the fragmentation of euro area bond markets. One possible strategy to mitigate this risk is to increase the average maturity structure of the debt, but the best remedy is to cut on the quantity of risk by swiftly improving government solvency.  Money markets have also been affected by the low rate environment, but an increase in short term interest rates may have an ambiguous impact. Since 2010, we have observed a significant decline in activity in these markets. Trading volumes in overnight interbank loans continued to decline in 2012 and are at very low levels by historical standards, some 60% below pre-crisis levels.  This may not only reflect continued fragmentation, but also the effects of ECB liquidity operations, which have partly replaced market activities. In principle, there are various reasons for assuming that a rise in policy rates would revive interbank market activity. First, very low levels of interest rates may drive financial intermediaries, such as the money market funds, out of the market. Second, institutions without access to the deposit facility have to place funds with Eurosystem counterparties at interest rates below the deposit facility rate. At the current very low rates, these institutions may try to withdraw the funds from the accounts with their custodian bank, thereby reducing the supply of funds and potentially increasing banks funding costs,. Therefore a rise in the policy rate may help to revive money markets, by bringing back important financial intermediaries. At the same time, as I have argued before, higher rates may negatively affect the balance sheet positions of some banks. If this reintroduces asymmetric information in the interbank                                                  7  This is best understood if one decomposes the risk premium into a price and a quantity of risk. The quantity of risk reflects the country-specific economic and fiscal situation. The price of risk instead reflects the general conditions on financial markets. Even if the quantity of risk remains constant, an increase in the price of risk may lead to a generalised increase in spreads. See, e.g., Manganelli, S and Wolswicjk, G, 2009, What drives spreads in the euro area government bond market?, Economic Policy, 58: 191–240. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 market and adverse selection through the exclusion of less reputable counterparties, the current market fragmentation and relatively low trading volumes may persist or even be magnified. Funding costs in the wholesale market may increase asymmetrically across euro area constituencies. Here, the best remedy is to restore full confidence in bank balance sheets through appropriate supervisory action. A quantitative assessment of the impact of selected macro-financial scenarios Let me turn to the final part of my presentation and look at some quantitative assessments of the various risks related to the current low-interest-rate environment. These assessments are based on the regular forward-looking solvency analyses conducted at the ECB. (CHART 4): I would like to discuss the results for four scenarios including a current baseline scenario. The three alternative scenarios are related to a possible return of risk aversion and a rise in interest rates in various market segments:  1. A worsening of the sovereign debt crisis. This scenario assumes a permanent rise in euro area long-term sovereign bond yields due to low growth and delays in the implementation of fiscal and structural reforms. The increases are country specific and range from zero impact to 370 basis points across countries. Further effects on the entire yield curve and other asset prices, notably equities, are taken into account.  2. Funding stress scenario. This scenario assumes the emergence of funding difficulties for banks in stressed countries that would arise from deposit outflows and reduced access to wholesale funding markets. This would imply higher interbank and customer loan rates. It would also induce banks to restrain their lending in order to comply with loan-to-deposit ratio targets - also in the light of the upcoming Basel III liquidity requirements.  3. Increased risk aversion. This scenario investigates the risks arising from a global unwinding of the search for yield. It assumes an abrupt increase in investor risk aversion worldwide, which results in stock price declines and a marked increase in corporate bond spreads, thereby raising interest rates in the more risky market segments. This would trigger a recession in the United States with negative implications for the global economic outlook.  The details of these scenarios and the underlying methodologies are discussed in detail in the latest ECB Financial Stability Review from May 2013. Just let me say that they are designed to account for a number of transmission channels and the size of the shock is based on historical evidence.  (CHART 5) The scenarios generate a rich set of results, but let me focus on the implications for bank capital. Under the baseline scenario, the core Tier 1 capitalisation of euro area large and complex banking groups would increase from 11.2% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 11.3% by the end of 2014.  Certainly, with regard to the findings of the adverse scenarios, they crucially depend on the implementation details of the individual scenarios. Nevertheless, we observe that a scenario configuration involving a rise in interest rates and asset price declines would in general tend to exert a negative influence on banks’ solvency positions.  This being said, the decline in the large and complex banking groups core Tier 1 capital ratios under the adverse scenarios is found to be relatively mild, which is a sign of resilience among the largest euro area banks also reflecting significant capital raising efforts in recent years. Specifically, the average core Tier 1 capital ratio would decline by 0.4 percentage points in the funding stress scenario, by 0.6 in the sovereign debt crisis scenario and by 1.1 in the global risk aversion scenario. However, the average numbers mask some dispersion across euro area countries. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches This analysis is focused on the banking sector. The situation in the euro area insurance sector differs somewhat. Insurance companies are also to some extent exposed to risks from shifts in sovereign bond yields and global risk aversion. Forward-looking analysis of the assets and liabilities of the euro area insurance sector indicates that the impact of these risks would remain limited due to comfortable capital buffers. For the euro area insurance sector, low yields on highly rated government bonds can constitute a solvency risk in the medium term. This holds in particular for those jurisdictions where a market-consistent approach to the treatment of liabilities is pursued. In this case, balance sheets are not only squeezed by the low profitability of assets, but also by the high value of liabilities. Although currently limited to only a few euro area countries, the liability effect will gain in importance on the eve of the introduction of the Solvency II regime. Conclusion and lessons for policy Let me conclude. Monetary policy has to support the economic recovery while avoiding another build-up of excessive financial imbalances, and there should be no trade-off between these two objectives. The monetary policy stance of the ECB will remain accommodative for as long as needed, and we will look with an open mind at standard and non-standard monetary policy tools if warranted by the outlook for price stability. In particular, we have to ensure that our effective monetary policy stance, as measured, among other indicators also by the term structure of money market rates, remains aligned with the Governing Council’s assessment, and with the outlook for price stability. The financial system should however be able to operate under a different constellation of yields. The current period of low interest rate should be used to prepare for it. A number of actions are needed, that cut across policy domains and in many cases will take time to bear results. They should be high on the policy agenda. Let me highlight three of them, for which monetary policy cannot substitute. First, bank capital and liquidity buffers should be sufficient to withstand a normalisation of yields in all market segments. In Europe, this can be achieved within the framework of the banking union. Before the start of the single supervisory mechanism, the ECB and national supervisory agencies will conduct a balance sheet assessment that provides a health check of euro area banks, with adequate peer review and drawing as necessary on third-party expertise. A comprehensive stress testing exercise will then be launched in cooperation with the European Banking Authority that covers a wide range of scenarios. Prior to these exercises, a credible backstop facility needs to be in place that can address potential capital shortfalls in banks’ balance sheets.  Second, regulatory measures aimed at curtailing excessive bank leverage, mitigating duration risk and avoiding excessive maturity transformation are needed to complement capital adequacy rules. Both the leverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio (NFSR) of Basel III are still under review, but the leverage ratio will be disclosed from 2015 and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision remains committed to introducing both ratios as minimum requirements in 2018, subject to a review period and proper calibration. I look forward to the outcome of the relevant work of the Committee. Third, governments that are lagging in their effort to consolidate debt and deficits should keep in mind that the current levels of yields cannot be taken for granted and that yield normalisation could take place in a differentiated way across jurisdictions, renewing the fragmentation of euro area capital markets. Thank you for your attention.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 William C Dudley: Why financial stability is a necessary prerequisite for an effective monetary policy Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Chairman of the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), at the Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture, Bank for International Settlements 2013 Annual General Meeting, Basel, 23 June 2013. *      *      * This panel is entitled Monetary Policy and Banking.1 That takes in a lot of territory. Rather than try to cover the waterfront, I am going to start with a single premise: Financial stability is a necessary prerequisite for an effective monetary policy. There is a critical chain of linkages from monetary policy to banking and onwards to the real economy. Financial stability is a necessary condition for those linkages to operate effectively. Thus, it is a necessary condition for monetary policy to be able to achieve its economic objectives.  I will then outline briefly what I see as some of the major implications that stem from that premise. These include that the central bank has a major role to play in ensuring financial stability and should evaluate the stance of monetary policy in light of problems in the financial system that may impair the monetary policy transmission mechanism.2  In my mind, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis has been that monetary policy cannot work properly when there is financial instability. When financial instability occurs, it disturbs market functioning and can also impair bank balance sheets. The result can be disruption to the financial intermediation function with resulting constraints on the availability of credit for households and businesses. This, in turn, can lead to further reductions in aggregate demand that put additional stress on the weakened financial system. Obviously, this is not a favorable dynamic. Financial instability can impact the conduct of monetary policy via three major channels. First, financial instability can generate a sufficiently large shock to aggregate demand that the central bank may encounter the zero lower bound constraint – the constraint that the monetary policy instrument, for example, the federal funds rate – cannot easily be pushed below zero. In such circumstances, it may not be easy to fully offset the shock through the pursuit of a more stimulative monetary policy. At the zero bound, the central bank is not powerless, and may turn to other monetary policy tools such as forward guidance and large scale asset purchases. But these tools may not be as effective as lowering the short-term rate instrument. In particular, the central bank may not be willing to use these nonconventional tools to the full extent necessary to provide the same degree of stimulus as it would provide if it could set interest rates at negative levels. That might be because of uncertainty about how nonconventional tools will work or because of the potential costs associated with the use of such tools in terms of market functioning and the risks of future financial instability.  Second, financial instability can impair the linkage between monetary policy and financial conditions. The central bank may move to a much more accommodative monetary policy stance, but this may not lead to much improvement in financial conditions. We see this clearly in spreads and risk premia during periods of financial stress. Depletion of capital in the banking system or the interaction of frictions and market failures may also lead to constraints on the availability of credit following a financial shock. As a recent U.S. example of the second issue, households with lower FICO scores have had difficulties in refinancing                                                  1  Krishna Guha, Marc Saidenberg and others on my staff contributed to these remarks. 2  As always, what I have to say here today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches their mortgages or in obtaining new mortgages to purchase a home. This stems from worries by lenders about put back risk – that such mortgages might be put back to them by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac should the mortgages become nonperforming. For any given reduction in mortgage rates relative to normal levels, this reduces the support for the housing sector and consumption. Thus, another lesson of the crisis is that monetary policymakers need to be more attuned to how the condition of the financial system influences how monetary policy changes affect financial conditions.  Third, the linkage between financial conditions and aggregate demand may also be impaired. For example, if an asset bubble has caused a buildup of debt that now needs to be reduced significantly, then lower interest rates that ease financial conditions may not stimulate aggregate demand very much. Separately, in a protracted zero bound episode, the monetary policy impulse may become attenuated over time. Lower interest rates may make financial conditions easier, lifting wealth, and encouraging households to shift spending from the future to the present. But when the future arrives, spending may then be lower as a consequence. The linkage between financial conditions and economic activity may vary depending on how long the accommodative monetary policy regime has been in place. So what are the implications that stem from the fact that financial instability can impair the efficacy of monetary policy? I think there are at least three major implications:  The central bank has a strong stake in preventing financial instability.   When financial instability occurs, the central bank has an important role in taking steps to mitigate that financial instability. This includes ensuring that credible liquidity backstops are available and forcing banks to strengthen themselves, for instance by raising additional capital.   The stance of monetary policy needs to be judged in light of how well the transmission channels of monetary policy are operating. When financial instability has disrupted the monetary policy transmission channels, following simple rules based on long-term historical relationships can lead to an inappropriately tight monetary policy.  Let me now consider each of these implications in turn. The first implication, that the central bank has a strong stake in preventing financial instability, has several elements. The central bank needs to be willing to respond to limit financial market bubbles from developing in the first place. This includes not just paying attention to asset price bubbles, but also to related excesses in leverage and in short-term funding markets. As I noted in a speech a few years ago, this is difficult to do in practice.3 After all, bubbles are difficult to identify in real time and the central bank’s policy toolkit to deal with bubbles may be limited. However, this difficulty cannot be an excuse for inaction. Using the bully pulpit, implementing macroprudential measures, or adjusting monetary policy can generate superior results compared to inaction.  The central bank also has to ensure that the financial system is sufficiently robust and resilient so that if there are financial market shocks, the banking system can absorb any shocks and continue to perform its credit intermediation function. This has many elements including tough capital and liquidity requirements for banks and strong financial market infrastructures. It also includes taking action to eliminate sources of vulnerabilities whenever they may arise – for example, strengthening the triparty repo system, reducing the vulnerability of money market mutual funds to runs, or forcing derivatives contracts to be standardized and centrally cleared. These actions should be undertaken during “peacetime” rather than when a crisis is already underway. Finally, the central bank needs to look over the horizon and identify market practices and processes that could make the financial system more vulnerable to shocks or that could                                                  3  See “Asset Bubbles and the Implications for Central Bank Policy”, Economic Club of New York, April 7, 2010. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 amplify such shocks. As an example, a tougher response to the poor mortgage underwriting practices evident during the U.S. housing bubble would have been appropriate in my opinion. Or more attention to bank compensation practices could have mitigated the incentives for excessive risk-taking.  The second implication is that when financial instability does occur, the central bank needs to respond forcefully to mitigate such instability. This includes ensuring that appropriate liquidity backstops are available. This is necessary in order to reassure counterparties that solvent institutions will have access to liquidity so that they can repay their obligations regardless of the degree of illiquidity or stress in the financial system. As we saw in the fall of 2008, without appropriate backstops, markets can seize up completely even when counterparties are perceived as solvent. That is because market participants tend to hoard liquidity during times of stress and because counterparties may not engage with one another when they are uncertain whether others will do so. Central bank liquidity backstops act as a coordinating device, solving the collective action problem faced by private market participants. However, in the most serious stress episodes, credible liquidity backstops alone will not always prove sufficient. It is also necessary to take steps to restore the banking system to health as soon as possible. This means forcing banks to cut their capital distributions early and to raise new capital in a timely way even if such capital-raising results in the forced dilution of existing shareholders.  With respect to bank capital, we saw two unwelcome behaviors during the crisis that central banks and other banking regulators need to lean against. Banks were reluctant to cut their capital distributions because of worries that this would signal weakness. Of course, these capital distributions just made the banks and the banking system weaker.  Also, we saw that banks were reluctant to raise capital to guard against particularly bad states of the world because they thought this might unnecessarily dilute their shareholders should such bad states of the world not materialize. Of course, the collective action of banks to not raise this additional capital made the banking system weaker than it would otherwise have been. This in turn made the possibility of the particularly bad states of the world more likely. In such circumstances – which the U.S. faced in 2009 and arguably the Eurozone faces today – it is essential for the authorities to force sufficient capital into the system. The subtlety here is that in a time of stress it is necessary to overcapitalize the banking system relative to the base case scenario in order to ensure financial stability and an ongoing supply of credit to the real economy in a stress scenario. Doing this makes the bad scenario less likely to materialize and the improvement in credit supply helps to engineer a stronger recovery than would otherwise materialize.4  The third implication is that the stance of monetary policy needs to be assessed based on the state of the financial system and the real economy. How the monetary policy impulse is transmitted to the real economy is not immutable but changes depending on how monetary policy affects financial conditions and how financial conditions affect economic activity.  During and following financial crises, problems in the financial system can impair the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. When this happens, policy may need to be more accommodative than otherwise in order to achieve its objectives.  The experiences of both Japan and United States are cases in point.5 In retrospect, we know that following the collapse of the property bubble and the investment boom in Japan in the 1990s, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) did not follow a sufficiently accommodative monetary policy                                                  4  Ideally, as was the case in the U.S. in 2009, the authorities should require banks to meet their stress scenario capital ratio standards by adding equity capital, with no credit given for reducing assets. This leans against the incentive to deleverage to meet higher capital ratio requirements. 5  See my recent speech “Lessons at the Zero Bound: The Japanese and U.S. Experience”, Japan Society, May 21, 2013. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches to prevent deflation. Although the BoJ response was appropriate relative to the economic forecasts that prevailed at the time, those forecasts proved much too optimistic. Thus, policy was insufficiently accommodative with the benefit of hindsight. To a lesser degree, the same critique also applies to the United States. Despite an aggressive shift towards greater monetary policy accommodation in 2008 and 2009, and ongoing subsequent easing – which has supported a return to growth and helped to facilitate needed adjustments in housing and household balance sheets – the economic recovery has been consistently weaker than forecast. As a result, the Federal Reserve has fallen short of meeting its employment and inflation objectives. This suggests that with the benefit of hindsight, U.S. monetary policy, though aggressive by historic standards, was not sufficiently accommodative relative to the state of the economy.  In this regard, I would caution against the mechanical use of monetary policy rules following a financial crisis. In the United States, the so-called Taylor Rule receives considerable attention as a guide to policy. But there are a number of reasons to believe that using it mechanically would result in too tight of a monetary policy setting. While discussing the shortcomings of the Taylor Rule is beyond the scope of my remarks today, let me make one simple point. If the transmission channels of monetary policy are impaired, then the equilibrium real rate associated with monetary policy neutrality is likely to be considerably lower than the 2.25 percent real rate assumption embodied in the typical Taylor Rule formulation. Monetary policy needs to take this onboard, even before considering other issues such as risk-management at the zero bound. I have argued today that the central bank needs to have a major role in ensuring that the financial system is sound. Without this, the central bank cannot ensure that monetary policy will be effective in achieving its objectives. This is the important linkage of monetary policy to banking.  Now some express concern that involvement in banking regulation and supervision may lead a central bank to bias the setting of monetary policy to try to help troubled banks or other institutions. This fear is misplaced. Problems in the financial sector are taken into account for monetary policy purposes only to the extent that they affect the transmission of policy to the real economy. There is a separate tool kit to address problems at the level of the banks themselves. Others will argue that having the central bank involved in the oversight and regulation of the financial system puts too much power in the hands of one authority. Another concern is that such a consolidation of responsibilities is dangerous for the central bank because it could threaten the central bank’s independence with respect to monetary policy. I think these are legitimate issues. But the bigger risks, in my view, are a monetary policy that fails to accomplish its economic objectives because of financial instability, and difficulties that stem from the inevitably imperfect coordination that takes place between multiple agencies with divided responsibilities during a crisis. In those cases, not only will the central bank own that bad outcome with the resulting negative consequences for its ongoing credibility and effectiveness, but also the economic consequences will be severe for its citizens. To address concerns about central bank power, the best approach is to ensure accountability. This means appropriate oversight by the legislature and ongoing transparency by the central bank about the motivations for its actions, what it can reasonably expect to accomplish, and an honest assessment of its successes and failures.  Thank you very much for your kind attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Stephen S Poloz: Reconstruction – rebuilding business confidence in Canada Remarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Oakville Chamber of Commerce, Burlington, Ontario, 19 June 2013. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for that introduction and to all of you for coming today. It is a pleasure to deliver my first public speech as Governor of the Bank of Canada here in the heart of southern Ontario, especially since we are just down the road from my hometown of Oshawa. This region is a historic centre of Canadian industry and commerce. It is home to some of Canada’s most storied businesses and prestigious centres of learning. Many of the firms that made this region and Canada strong were on the front lines as the global financial crisis pushed the Canadian economy into recession. As our economy continues to expand, it will be the performance of the business sector here and across Canada over the coming while that we will be watching with great interest. That’s because what happens to business in Canada matters for the Bank of Canada. Not just because we care – which, let me assure you, we do. But in order for us to do our job properly, in order for us to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canadians, we need to understand all the dynamics that feed into the Canadian economy. The Bank aims to keep inflation low, stable and predictable. Our flexible inflation-targeting framework is the best contribution monetary policy can make so that Canadian households and businesses can make decisions about their financial futures with confidence. Over the past couple of decades, the average rate of inflation has been very close to our 2 per cent target. Even during the global economic and financial crisis, our commitment did not waver. The inflation target is sacrosanct to us and has become a credible anchor for the inflation expectations of Canadians. Moreover, the target is symmetrical: we care just as much about inflation falling below as we do about it rising above the target. When inflation falls below the target and interest rates are correspondingly low, there is little room for conventional monetary policy to respond to negative shocks. When inflation is above target, the erosion of purchasing power becomes significant and uncertainty about future prices makes it hard for households and businesses to make good financial decisions. Further, the framework has built-in flexibility with respect to the amount of time it takes to return inflation to target after a shock. Years of successful inflation targeting have given the Bank the credibility to use this flexibility during periods of economic stress. A flexible exchange rate is also key to achieving our inflation targets over time. The recent turmoil showed us the value of the credibility we have earned. Like others, to address the stresses of the crisis, we put the flexibility of our regime to work. Nonetheless, throughout the recession and since, the inflation expectations of Canadians have remained well anchored at the target, proving that our framework is secure and working. This past downturn was different from previous recessions. Even though Canada performed better than our G-7 peers, the Great Recession put many companies out of business, especially small and exporting firms. Many of those that survived dramatically reduced their operations, shuttering plants and dismantling equipment. These actions hurt – badly – in terms of job losses and lost output. While both have recovered – in fact, surpassed their pre-recession peaks – the structural damage caused by 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches the crisis lingers. Indeed, our recovery has been primarily driven by higher household spending, while exports have lagged behind. Rather than a recovery in the usual sense, this looks more like a postwar reconstruction. Or, if you will allow me to slide into more academic language for a moment and refer to the Schumpeterian process of “creative destruction,” we’ve certainly had the destruction. But the creation side of the equation has been delayed by numerous unusual risks, heightened uncertainty, and a lack of confidence. This is what I want to talk about today. I want to discuss the impact of the crisis on Canadian business and how the firms that have survived have changed and are responding. We need business confidence to continue to heal. This matters very much to the Bank of Canada. Our understanding of these issues will be part of the rigorous distillation of information that drives our policy decisions. As part of the process, we meet, we talk, we argue and do our best to understand the significant forces driving the economy. With our next policy decision on 17 July, we are now at the early stage of this round. Standard macroeconomic models can only go so far in capturing today’s dynamics, and especially when uncertainty is greater than normal, it is important to supplement the models with insights directly from business. My messages today will be relevant for companies across Canada, but they resonate particularly in this region. As a native of Oshawa, I understand that well. I have seen the impact of the crisis and the recession on the auto sector in my hometown. I have heard about it from the manufacturers and exporters in this region. And the Bank has heard about it from the financial community on Bay Street and from all types of business leaders in southern Ontario who participate in the Bank’s quarterly business outlook surveys. Worst recession since the depression I probably don’t need to tell anyone in this room that the recent global recession was the worst downturn experienced since the Great Depression. In very short order, global GDP fell more than 3 per cent and millions upon millions of jobs were lost. In Canada, 432,000 jobs were lost and GDP fell 4.2 per cent. The unemployment rate spiked to 8.7 per cent. The severity of the global economic and financial crisis delivered a direct, sharp blow to Canadian business. Canada experienced a particularly deep contraction of investment and exports. The trauma was severe and long-lasting. Its impact was felt by businesses across the country, businesses that saw their markets dwindle and their balance sheets deteriorate. In a downturn that lasts, say, nine months, a bank will likely let its clients ride out the recession. But in a prolonged crisis, the story is more complex. Credit can become tough to find. Anecdotally, we know that otherwise solvent and creditworthy firms were left with considerably less credit than they needed. In too many cases, temporary plant shutdowns were not sufficient to match the fall in demand or the decline in financing. Some firms reduced their operations. Others simply closed their doors. Let’s look at some of the facts. During a normal growth period in Canada, there is a steady increase in the number of businesses in operation. In short, creative destruction results in the net creation of new firms. But since the onset of the recession, there has been limited net creation of businesses. Canada’s exporters have been particularly hard hit. The group most profoundly affected has been manufacturing exporters, whose ranks have continued to shrink. Canada is not alone in this regard. In the United States, the dynamics were similar but even more dramatic. The net number of new establishments fell for three years in a row until 2011, when, finally, the trend turned around. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 The reconstruction challenge Perhaps there should be no surprise, then, given the decline in global demand, the drop in the number of American companies to trade with, and the related drop in the number of Canadian exporters, that Canada’s export sector has lagged. It is the only component of Canada’s GDP that remains below its pre-recession peak. Our annual exports are more than $100 billion lower than would be typical at this point in a recovery cycle. Regaining the lost output of companies that have disappeared or downsized will require that existing firms boost their production, that they invest to expand their capacity, and that the net creation of new firms resumes a higher growth path. The good news is that the balance sheets of corporate Canada are healthy and the capacity to invest exists. We could see that the recession was causing a significant structural change in the Canadian economy at the time. The Bank acknowledged that this destruction of potential was happening in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report in April 2009. Reflecting its best judgment, the Bank reduced its estimates of potential output growth in each of the years from 2009 to 2011. Nonetheless, we were relatively fortunate in Canada. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, stimulative monetary and fiscal policies proved highly effective in maintaining domestic demand, particularly household expenditures. Household spending was supported by strong growth in borrowing, which resulted in record-high debt-to-income levels. Given the circumstances, it was a good thing that households had the capacity to expand their spending – this provided a necessary cushion from the worst effects of the global contraction. The Bank has been careful to remind people that interest rates will rise at some point. We have urged homeowners and other borrowers to do the arithmetic to ensure that they will be able to manage their debts at more normal interest rates. I am confident that this is exactly what people are doing. This growth model has been effective, but its limits are clear. In fact, while recent data are choppy, we continue to see a constructive evolution of activity in the housing sector. What needs to happen next is for export momentum to build and business investment to recover while the household sector settles into a more balanced and sustainable growth path. For all of this to happen will require the rebuilding of Canada’s economic potential. That is what makes this recovery cycle unique. Automotive sector Let me use some cases studies to illustrate this. The structural transformation of the auto sector has been dramatic. The 70-per cent decline in production from peak to trough was brutal. Machinery was boxed up and sent overseas. Plants closed. These were very hard times for this sector and those who make their living from it. The crisis in the auto sector prompted the federal government to step in with extraordinary financial support. That support helped save thousands of jobs throughout southern Ontario. The firms that survived have lowered their cost structures. We are seeing more innovative processes and accelerated new product development. These elements improve the competitiveness of Canadian firms and position them well to go head-to-head with U.S. and global parts-sector firms. They also help Canada to gain a foothold in global supply chains. The recovery of auto sales in the United States is clearly under way – the first essential ingredient. But it remains to be seen how the reconstruction process I’ve discussed today will play out for this important sector. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Forestry I could tell a similar story about Canada’s forestry sector, which – like the auto sector – is much smaller than before. In 2012, the Canadian forestry industry accounted for about 1.2 per cent of total GDP, down from around 1.6 per cent in 2007. During the same period, almost 60,000 workers – about 20 per cent of the forestry workforce – were displaced. Here, too, the recovery in U.S. housing and the building of new relationships in fast-growing markets, such as China, are contributing to improved confidence. I could describe similar stories for other sectors including ICT (information and communications technology) and biotechnology. These are all stories that we need to keep watching. What businesses are telling us From the frequent conversations the Bank has with business leaders, we know that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in Canada. Some of the decline in exports reflects the ingenuity of Canadian firms, including firms in this region, in responding to the U.S. slowdown by pivoting their products and marketing to the faster-growing segments of the Canadian economy. Others became more competitive through restructuring or finding a niche adjacent to their traditional market. Such insights feed importantly into the Bank’s understanding of the workings of the Canadian economy, and thus into the policy deliberations of the Bank – and I strongly believe that, especially in these unusual times, as we work to understand the undercurrents of the recovery, this kind of dialogue with the private sector is critical. Confidence To realize the economic growth that Canada is looking for – a return to self-sustaining, self-generating growth – we need to see the rebuilding of capacity, through both the expansion of existing companies and the creation of new ones. This will require growing confidence among existing businesses and entrepreneurs. The gathering momentum in foreign demand, especially in the United States, should help lift the confidence of Canada’s exporters. This is critical for Canadian firms to boost their investment to expand their productive capacity. The sequence we can anticipate is the following: foreign demand will build; our exports will strengthen further; confidence will improve; existing companies will expand; companies will invest to increase capacity; and new ones will be created. This sequence may already be underway. Conclusion To conclude: In monetary policy, actions are critically important. The Bank is absolutely committed, as I mentioned earlier, to keeping inflation predictable, stable and on target so firms can make longer-term decisions in an environment of confidence. But words, too, matter a great deal. By explaining the cross-currents at work in our economy, our projections for what’s ahead, and our monetary policy response, we can help to heal business confidence. And in order to expand our understanding of what’s happening in the real economy, we listen to businesses, to labour groups and to industry associations. Beneath our economic and financial statistics and analysis are real people, making real decisions. Those decisions are hard to make at any time, but when uncertainty is high and confidence low, they can be even more difficult. I am optimistic that the signs are there that the process is under way. Right now, what we need most is stability and patience. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 To help nurture confidence, an active engagement with Canadians must remain a cornerstone of the policy of the Bank of Canada. So thank you for being here today. I’m keen to hear your views, and I would be pleased to take your questions.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Deepak Mohanty: Impact of the euro area crisis on South Asia Paper by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, presented at the SAARCFINANCE Group Meeting, Islamabad, 18 June 2013. *      *      * The assistance provided by Dr. Mohua Roy and Mr. Somnath Sharma is gratefully acknowledged. The global financial crisis originated in the US and then spread to Europe. While the global growth has recovered from the trough of 2009, Europe has lapsed into recession again. The continuing uncertainty in the euro area poses a major risk to the global economy today. It has affected the growth prospects of both advanced and emerging market economies through trade, financial and confidence channels. Given the interconnectedness of global financial markets, the principal risk to emerging markets and developing countries (EMDEs) arise from ‘risk on’ and ‘risk off’ behaviour of global financial market. Of late through following resolute policy actions, financial conditions have improved in the euro area (IMF, 2013)1. However, the real economy has shown no sign of improvement. With very little fiscal space, macro policy response to growth slowdown remains limited.  The euro area crisis first surfaced in 2009 when Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain slipped into recession with exceedingly high budget deficits. The crisis deepened further in 2010 with credit rating agencies downgrading the sovereigns and banks in the peripheral Europe. This significantly dented confidence, even threatening the very existence of the euro. Consequently, the risks to the global economy rose. Against this backdrop, I briefly touch upon the causes of crisis and subsequent stability enhancing policy measures in euro area. I then turn to how the crisis affected South Asia, particularly India. I conclude by highlighting some mitigating measures that we have taken to strengthen our external account.  Causes of the crisis The problems in the euro area are largely structural in nature and existed even prior to the crisis. The global crisis only amplified the weaknesses in the system. “In the years preceding the crisis, the EU became divided between countries with positive trade balances and sound budgets – the core - and those with growing budget deficits and external deficits financed by private credit flows increasingly sourced from the first group of countries for unproductive spending – the periphery. With the onset of global financial crisis, the external deficits, budget deficits and levels of public debt of the countries in the second group largely became unsustainable once they were no longer financed by the rest of the EU (Draghi, 2013)2. The origin of the euro area crisis is in the high level of fiscal deficit and debt. First, a large part of the fragile fiscal position in these economies is attributable to expenditure on entitlements due to an ageing population without commensurate increase in revenues and lack of growth- enhancing structural reforms. In this process, the public sector structure has become bloated. Second, due to low domestic saving rate, public debt had to be financed through borrowings resulting in widening of current account deficit and a growing external debt. While the membership of the euro area gave a false sense of comfort to the periphery countries, the intra-euro area financial imbalance remained severe. Third, as the euro area crisis unraveled, the interconnection between sovereigns and banks was reflected in the                                                  1  IMF (2013): ‘Old Risks, New Challenges’, Global Financial Stability Report, April 2013. 2  Draghi, Mario (2013): ‘The euro, monetary policy and reforms’, Speech on the occasion of receiving an honorary degree in political science at LUISS “Guido Carli” University, Rome, 6 May. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches positive correlations between sovereign and bank credit default swap (CDS) spreads especially for the periphery countries.  The management of the euro area crisis has become complex because of three reasons. First, consequent to rating downgrades, a number of countries have faced rising bond yields and challenges in funding the sovereign debt. Second, euro area banks are undercapitalized, mainly due to losses on sovereign bonds, and have faced liquidity problems leading to credit constraints. Third, slow/negative economic growth accentuated fiscal risks (Chart 1). Let me now turn to policy measures taken to stabilize the euro area.   Policy measures The crisis has prompted the European Union (EU), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to take several measures to stabilize the European economies. The creation of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) in 2010 and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) in 2011 responded to the urgency of crisis in the periphery. However, many subsequent improvements that led to the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) have placed the regional financing arrangements on a much stronger footing.  In addition, the EU is also addressing the institutional deficiencies in the monetary union by gradually moving towards banking and the fiscal union. Europe took its first big step towards banking union in December 2012, as EU finance ministers agreed to make the ECB the common bank supervisor.  The EU has also tried to make fiscal rules more stringent. In this regard, the treaty on stability, coordination and governance known as “fiscal compact”, has come into force in January 2013. This is an intergovernmental Treaty which establishes that member states must enact laws, preferably at constitutional level, requiring their national budgets to be in balance or in surplus within the Treaty's definition. The laws must also contain a self-correcting mechanism to prevent any breach. The Treaty defines a balanced budget as a general budget deficit of less than 3.0 per cent of GDP, and a structural deficit of less than 1.0 per cent of GDP if the debt level is below 60 per cent. If the debt level is above 60 per cent of GDP, the structural deficit norm is more stringent at below 0.5 per cent of GDP. The “two-pack” regulations subject euro area countries to the obligation of ex ante notification of budgetary plans to the European Commission (EC). Should countries be subject to an 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 excessive deficit procedure (EDP) or be involved in a financial assistance program by the ESM, they will also be subject to an enhanced monitoring by the EC (Praet, 2013)3. The ECB has taken a number of policy measures ranging from lowering the policy interest rate, substantial bond buying and provision of concessional loans to banks. The ECB launched its Long Term Refinancing Operations(LTRO) which made available three-year loans to banks: 523 banks borrowed €489 billion in December 2011 and 800 banks borrowed € 530 billion in February 2012. The ECB launched Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) in September 2012 to make discretionary purchases of short-term sovereign bonds with a prior request by the concerned sovereigns for international assistance via the EFSF/ESM.  The IMF contributed to emergency lending and has elaborated and monitored the economic adjustments programs for Greece, Ireland and Portugal in close cooperation with the EC and the ECB known as the ‘Troika’. Even though the major share of the financial support has come from euro-zone countries, the scale of the IMF’s lending has been substantial. Since the size of the rescue packages has been huge, the cooperation with the EC and ECB was important as IMF alone would not have been able to raise the entire quantum of emergency funds. Let me now turn to the impact of the euro area crisis on SAARC region. Impact on South Asia The euro area has traditionally been an important economic partner for South Asia. The share of exports to the euro area in total exports ranged from around 38 per cent for Maldives to 10 per cent for Nepal with India’s share being 13 per cent in 2012. Between 2011 and 2012, share of SAARC’s export to euro area has contracted significantly (Table 1).          In addition to absorbing a significant share of the region’s exports, it has been a source of foreign direct investment and other forms of capital flows (Lee et al. 2013)4. It is interesting to note that when the euro area crisis hit the global economy in 2010, our exports to that region did not decline immediately. This was mainly because of our two major trading partners, viz., Germany and France, which were doing well. In the subsequent period, as the crisis intensified, our exports to euro area declined (Chart 2).                                                   3  Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, ‘The crisis response in the euro area’, Beijing, 17 April 2013. 4  Lee, Minsoo, Donghyun Park, Arnelyn Abdon, and Gemma Estrada, (2013) ‘Economic Impact of Eurozone Sovereign Debt Crisis on Developing Asia’ ADB Working Paper Series No. 336, January 2013. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Another way in which euro area crisis has impacted the South Asian economies is through the finance channel. European banks have been an important source of credit to South Asia. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), at the end of December 2012 consolidated claims of the European banks on South Asia amounted to around US $164 billion, equivalent to 44 per cent of the region’s total foreign banks’ claims. There has also been an impact through the stock markets. While deleveraging by European banks reduced lending to emerging markets, shifting of investor sentiment reduced flow to emerging stock markets (Avdjiev et al. 2012)5. Let me now turn to the impact on India.  Impact on India Indian economy is significantly integrated with the euro area. The impact so far has been mainly through trade and finance channels. As a result of slowdown in euro area, the India’s merchandise exports to the region declined from US$ 42.7 billion in 2011 to US$ 37.8 billion in 2012 (Chart 3). Consequently, its share in India’s total exports declined from 13.9 per cent to 12.8 per cent. In fact, euro area’s share in India’s exports was much higher at 16 per cent in 2008 (Table 1).                                                  5  Avdjiev, Stefan , Zsolt Kut , Előd Takáts: (2012) ‘The euro area crisis and cross-border bank lending to emerging markets’, BIS Quarterly Review, December 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Furthermore, the share of India’s software services exports to Europe declined from 26 per cent of total software export earnings in 2009-10 to 24 per cent in 2011-12. Europe accounts for more than one-third of total tourist arrivals in India. Travel receipts have also suffered because of lower tourist arrivals from the euro area, particularly from the affected countries.  Deleveraging in European banking system impacted credit flows to India (Chart 4). The consolidated claims of the European banks on India declined from US$ 146 billion in December 2010 to US $ 139 billion in December 20126.   Euro area is also an important source of foreign direct investment (FDI) to India. It accounted for around 18 per cent of the total FDI into India in 2012-13. Given the more stable nature of these flows as compared to foreign institutional investment (FII) flows, the crisis has had a                                                  6  Excluding UK and Switzerland, European banks’ claim on India stood at US $ 56 billion at end-December 2012. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches marginal impact on the FDI flows to India. When the crisis began, the FDI flows from euro area economies declined from about US$ 3.5 billion in 2009-10 to about US$ 3.1 billion in 2010-11. However, it recovered to US$ 4.2 billion in 2011-12 and around US$ 3.5 billion in 2012-13 (Table 2).                In addition, Europe constitutes a major source of private transfer inflows to India, around 19 per cent in 2008-09. As the unemployment situation in euro area continues to deteriorate, it may have an adverse impact on remittance flow to India.  Conclusion The uncertainty about the duration of the euro area crisis persists as there has not been much improvement in its real economy despite a string of policy steps. While reforms are being initiated, fresh concerns are surfacing: for example, recent downgrade of both Italy and France.  In India, we have been proactive in addressing the challenges posed by the uncertainties in the global economy, particularly in the euro area. As capital inflows to our economy have turned volatile, financing of our large current account deficit has become a challenge. In this context, various policy measures have been undertaken by the Reserve Bank and the Government to moderate imports and to improve capital inflows.  Oil and gold are the two major items of our imports. With regard to oil, the domestic pricing has increasingly been made market determined. It is expected that this will help economizing the domestic oil consumption. Recently import duty on gold has been raised and bank finance against pledge of gold has been restricted. The efficacy of these measures, however, is yet to be tested. We have also introduced inflation indexed bonds which should help contain gold demand to the extent these bonds are used as an investment hedge against inflation. Notwithstanding these measures for a fast growing economy like ours, import demand is bound to be high. Hence, we have to step up exports to narrow the trade gap. But in a phase of sluggish global economy, it is difficult to push up exports. Nevertheless, initiatives have been taken to diversify trade towards emerging markets. On balance, however, the current account deficit remains high thus needs to be financed through capital inflows.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 The policy measures taken to encourage capital inflows include liberalisation of the interest rates on non-resident deposits and external commercial borrowings, rationalisation of norms related to foreign institutional investment (FII) in infrastructure debt and allowing foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail. The sectoral limit for FII investment in government securities and corporate bonds has been hiked.  To sum up, while national authorities are taking steps, international financial institutions (IFIs) like the IMF need to be more proactive to suggest ways to limit the spillover and prompt actions to be taken to arrest further deterioration in global economic condition. In this context, speedy implementation of a complete banking union in the euro area with an integrated regulatory and supervisory structure assumes importance. In this scenario our economies need to strive for increasing resilience while being prepared to deal with the negative spillovers from the crisis. The immediate concern for India is to reduce the current account deficit from its present high level. Over the medium-term, efforts made to diversify trade towards emerging market and developing economies should be stepped up. In this context, there is greater scope for trade and financial integration in the SAARC region which will be mutually beneficial. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Prasarn Trairatvorakul: Financing tomorrow – the Greater Mekong Subregion Keynote address by Dr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Euromoney Greater Mekong Subregion Investment Forum, Bangkok, 13 June 2013. *      *      * Excellencies, Honorable Speakers, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1.  It is a great pleasure to be here at the Euromoney Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Investment Forum once again and an honour to give some remarks on the topic of ‘Financing Tomorrow: The GMS’. A year ago, I had the opportunity to talk about this topic once. At that time, I shared my thoughts on the roles of Thai financial intermediaries as a ‘connector’ bridging between global financial players and small local institutions. 2.  This year, we are gathered during a time when the GMS is undergoing tremendous economic reforms. Member countries are transitioning towards higher degrees of openness and are integrating with the global economic mainstreams. The GMS economies have grown at some of the fastest rates in the world since the early 1990s, averaging close to 8%, despite the gloom of the recent global financial crisis. This transformation has contributed to economic convergence and narrowed the development divide within the region. The gap of income differences between the GMS and the rest of Asian countries in their neighbourhood has been reduced continuously. 3.  With the promising economic potentials ahead of us, I would like to reemphasize our shared vision of “What we shall expect to see for the future of the Greater Mekong Subregion” and “How we can achieve such prosperity.” 4.  I picture the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in the next twenty years as a much more connected and integrated region: a region where we are not only connected solely by a river, but by various modes of transportation, where one can travel conveniently, where trade and investment can flow across efficiently, and where prosperity can be widely enjoyed even by those in the rural areas. Although we are not yet there, I strongly believe that this vision can come true. 5.  We always hear the saying “Rome was not built in a day”. Thus, we have to start working together towards our shared vision starting today. There is a great deal of preparatory work to be done; but in my view, some of the most crucial tasks are infrastructure development and businesses access to funds. The first task is channelling intraregional funds to infrastructure projects, followed by the second task of promoting economic growth and equality within the region through enhancing financial markets and supporting private financing. Ladies and Gentlemen, 6.  Let me highlight key issues on the first preparatory work, which is financing infrastructure development. The ADB has already committed at least 9 billion US dollars1 to fund its GMS development projects in the pipeline. Besides, it has also estimated that roughly 8 trillion US dollars2 will be required to meet the infrastructure needs of Asia over the next decade. Although this amount is daunting, I believe that it can be fulfilled, given the current global capital surge and the fact that Asian savers put away around 7 trillion of US                                                 1  2012, ADB website (http://www.adb.org/countries/gms/news-releases) 2  http://www.adbi.org/files/2009.08.31.book.infrastructure.seamless.asia.pdf pp.181 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  dollars3 each year. Like directing the flow of flood to the right river so that it can become benefit for those living in the area, this overflowing capital can be harnessed to benefit needed long-term projects. 7.  To meet the region’s financing requirements, we should look into new means to attract funding. Firstly, by promoting private sector participation in infrastructure development through public-private partnership (PPP). The PPP model can improve the efficiency of long-term projects by adopting the private sector’s expertise and reducing the burden on government budget. Although the PPP model has long been discussed, the implementation of this model is still a trial-and-error practice. Regardless, I believe that through clear governance and suitable regulatory framework, PPPs could promote private sector’s participation and bring in the untapped resources. Secondly, by customizing innovative financial instruments. This calls for inter-agency collaborative efforts to introduce innovative financial instruments which link specific funding requirements and market preferences. To name a few, Thailand has recently launched its first infrastructure fund to finance its sky train extension. On an international scale, financial cooperation initiatives, such as the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF) would also complement domestic endeavors in channelling intraregional savings to needed projects. 8.  This leads me to the second of the preparatory work, which is improving supportive framework for private financing. The Mekong river is made up of small tributaries flowing towards the same end to form a large fertile river. The benefits we receive from the confluence of these small tributaries as opposed to one waterway are incomparable. Likewise, strengthening domestic capital markets would help allocating available savings to the most productive use, thus, facilitating real sector’s economic activities and supporting economic growth. 9.  A deep and liquid financial market could reduce business over-reliance on bank financing channel. On the other hand, it could also serve as a less-expensive alternative source of funds for local entities. The initial stepping stone towards a well-developed financial market is to improve the cross-country interconnectedness of local financial markets. Financial connectivity could be enhanced by linking capital and bond markets, creating regional exchange trading system, as well as developing a network of payment and settlement system. Another important step is to streamline rules and regulations to facilitate cross-border movement of capital. Such a process can be achieved through promoting flows of capital among member countries via reducing regulatory obstacles to stimulate foreign participation and outward investment. Currently, Thailand allows non-residents of ASEAN to issue both foreign currency-denominated and local currency bonds. The derivative market also serves investors to hedge against financial risks. In addition, regional financial cooperation such as the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) and the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) could also help support the development of local bond markets. 10.  To sum up my remarks, the process of strengthening financial markets and enhancing their capacity to absorb large long-term development projects is a long-drawn process in which the commitment of public sector alone cannot guarantee success. Of course, the public sector must fulfill its integral role in creating a supportive regulatory framework and in distributing public goods so that economic benefits can be enjoyed and shared by social participants through the whole range of the income spectrum.                                                 3  Gross national savings in 2012 of 32 Asian countries is approximately 7.14 USD trillion (Countries used in calculation include China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and others) from IMF Source; WEO 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  However, private entities must collaborate with the public sector and step in to bridge current financing gaps and take part in the structural reform process. Ladies and gentlemen, 11.  In light of our historical background, we, as part of the GMS community, have shared long-lasting prosperity throughout the Mekong River areas. Looking ahead, it will be our future that needs more commitments and a more united aspiration from each of us to move forward together as a cohesive region. The opportunities ahead are apparent, if we can transform each member countries’ strengths into regional competitiveness, these opportunities can be multiplied. By taking this conference today as a platform to share our common vision, I believe this is the initial important step that shall lead our region towards its sustainable and inclusive potentials. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yves Mersch: The European Central Bank’s role in overcoming the crisis Speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the UniCredit Business Dialogue, Hamburg, 17 June 2013. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, Many thanks for the invitation to the Business Dialogue. When I last gave a speech in Hamburg – almost exactly two years ago – I also focused on overcoming the crisis. Though the crisis is indeed not over yet, much has certainly happened in the meantime: • we have a powerful set of instruments for overcoming the crisis; • the economic governance framework at European level has been reinforced; • we are on the path towards a banking union that can break the negative feedback loop between banks and sovereign debtors. The organisers have asked me to address the ECB’s role in this context and I’m happy to honour their request. But let me make it quite clear from the start: the ECB has an explicit mandate. Our task is to ensure price stability in the euro area, and our non-standard measures have contributed to that objective. But monetary policy cannot be called on to overcome the crisis. A sustainable resolution to the crisis lies in the hands of the Member States. So this evening I would like to look at two questions: • First, what is the role of monetary policy in overcoming the crisis? • Second, are the euro area governments living up to their responsibility to eliminate the causes of the crisis? Let me begin with the role of the ECB. The ECB’s core task is to ensure price stability. That has not changed, nor will it change. We have a clear mandate, which was conferred on us by the Member States’ governments at supra-national level under the European treaties. It is virtually cast in stone. At the same time, we have operational leeway in choosing how to fulfil this mandate – provided that we stay within its limits. During the crisis it emerged that, in some places, the transmission of our monetary policy signals to the real economy was restricted or uneven. In central banking we speak of a distorted monetary transmission mechanism. We therefore took non-standard measures so that our monetary policy would be more effectively passed through to the financing conditions for the real economy. These non-standard measures complement our traditional set of instruments. Put simply: our interest rate decisions are aimed at price stability. The non-standard measures seek to ensure that the desired effect of these decisions also spreads across the entire euro area. One of these non-standard measures is the policy of full allotment in our refinancing operations against appropriate collateral. We have also extended the maturities of our refinancing operations up to three years and have expanded the collateral framework. These measures are geared towards banks‘ refinancing conditions, which in turn make it easier for credit institutions to provide sufficient credit to the economy at favourable terms. Last summer we decided on more far-reaching measures – notably the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions. Prior to this announcement, we had to observe that market 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  financing conditions were increasingly characterised by the fears among market participants that Member States would revert back to their national currencies. The markets hence priced in a conversion risk premium. Owing in part to this premium, the refinancing conditions of many commercial banks – and thereby the real economy – deteriorated dramatically. The ECB’s monetary policy is committed to maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. So we had to take measures that would ensure that our single monetary policy would take effect in all Member States. Since the summer of last year, financing conditions for the real economy in the euro area have clearly improved. The situation is clearly returning to normal. That is also felt by savers, pension funds and insurance companies here in Germany: the yields on German government bonds have increased, having previously been extremely low because some investors had been panicked into reshuffling their portfolios in favour of supposedly safer havens. These yields had even turned negative at times. The distortions of the monetary transmission mechanism have thus visibly receded. At the same time, the influence of monetary policy on the return on savings is overestimated. For one, the real return is what primarily feeds savings in an economy. In the long term, the real return is mainly defined by production potential. By adjusting the interest rate, monetary policy only serves to smoothen developments in order to prevent the economy from overheating, causing an acceleration in inflation or – during a crisis, say – from entering a deflationary spiral. Second, monetary policy behaves neutrally towards different savings instruments. It does not give preference to savings over investments in equities or in fixed income securities, both of which have gained considerably in value in Germany over the past few months. All of our non-standard measures are only temporary. For a short time, an overly ample provision of central bank liquidity to the banking sector is not incompatible with our mandate to maintain purchasing power. We can adjust the interest rate for these operations at any time. And excessive liquidity is automatically returned: banks demand less liquidity as soon as the monetary transmission mechanism improves. This process is in full swing. The three-year longer-term refinancing operations that I referred to before will expire at the beginning of 2015. Many banks have, however, already repaid the funds they had borrowed. So the design of our non-standard measures is such that a special withdrawal strategy is not required. At the same time, we are aware of the long-term risks to stability associated with extremely low rates and excessive liquidity over too long a period. It is hence imperative that repair efforts in other areas are carried out resolutely and thoroughly. The ECB is indeed making an important contribution to crisis management but it cannot resolve the crisis by monetary means. In the end, it can only win time for other policy sectors to carry out the necessary adjustments and reforms. It is up to the governments of the Member States to live up to their responsibility. They need to remedy remaining deficiencies in the European governance framework. And they must gear their economic policies to the demands of an economic and monetary union. Important steps have been taken since the outset of the crisis. The Member States must now single-mindedly continue on the path towards a new and more robust political economy. The first step taken was the establishment of an effective set of instruments for the management and resolution of crises in the euro area. Initially, crisis-related measures by the Member States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had had to be arranged ad hoc. Since October last year, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has replaced the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) that had been designed as a temporary measure. The ESM has the organisation structure of an intergovernmental body. With a view to the progressive deepening of European integration, its further development into a truly 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  federal institution would certainly be more appropriate that any questioning of the ECB’s mandate. The new measures taken at the European level have proved to be effective in countering contagion in the euro area in the most serious stages of the crisis. Financial markets and consumers are gaining renewed confidence in the euro area, even though the prospects for growth and employment remain weak over the medium term. Combining financial assistance with strict conditions has brought the negative economic trends in the programme countries to a halt. The economic downturn in some of the most strongly affected countries may even have bottomed out in the near future. What is crucial now is to ensure that the programme countries do not stray from the path of essential fiscal, financial and structural adjustment. The second step undertaken was the strengthening of the framework for steering economic policy at the European level. It is aimed at preventing dangerous imbalances in both public budgets and current accounts more effectively in future. The Governing Council of the ECB has urged time and again that economic governance in the euro area be improved, calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be strengthened, for procedures to be put in place to counter macroeconomic imbalances and for the ceilings on public debt and deficits set out in the Stability and Growth Pact to be transposed into national legislation in all Member States. We welcome that the regulatory framework has been reformed accordingly. However, the regulatory framework alone cannot ensure that economic policies are sound. Paper doesn’t blush, as clearly evidenced by the failure of the original Stability and Growth Pact. The new governance framework can only be successful if it is implemented consistently, according to both the letter and the spirit of what has been agreed. Its success thus depends on the action taken by the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. All this is confirmed by taking a brief look at the current “European semester”, the new process for the coordination of economic policy in the European Union. I fear that the unsound economic policies in some Member States are once again not being opposed decisively enough. The rules of the new European governance framework can only be effective if they are strictly applied. In particular, deadlines for the correction of excessive budget deficits should, for instance, only be extended, by way of exception, in the event of exceedingly adverse circumstances. Extensions should not become the rule. The third set of measures is to be found in the first steps undertaken towards a banking union. The measures are aimed, in particular, at disrupting negative feedback loops between banks and public sector debtors, and at halting the increasing fragmentation of European financial markets. All banks in the euro area, as well as the credit institutions in Member States that have arranged for close cooperation with the ECB, will be subject to European supervision, the “Single Supervisory Mechanism”. Although the ECB will be responsible for the direct supervision of only large, systemically important credit institutions, this does not mean that other banks will not be covered by the ECB’s supervisory framework. National supervisory authorities will have to comply with the regulations, guidelines and instructions of the ECB. Moreover, the ECB will be able at any time to take over the direct supervision of smaller credit institutions. Current plans envisage that common supervision will commence in the second half of next year. However, common banking supervision is only one element of a true banking union. In parallel, we also need a common resolution mechanism. The two elements are somewhat like Siamese twins – one cannot survive without the other. Their combination is the only way in which negative feedback loops between the banking sector and public budgets can be disrupted. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The detailed design of the “single resolution mechanism” is still the subject of debate in Brussels and the Member States’ capital cities. Without prejudice to any decisions thereon, I would like to highlight two elements that I regard as being particularly important when designing the single resolution mechanism: on the one hand, the geographical and institutional scope of applicability of the single resolution mechanism should be the same as that of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. A European resolution authority would ensure that decisions are taken in a timely and objective manner. A network of national authorities would fall short of what is necessary in this respect. Cases where a bank finds itself in a precarious situation call for swift and efficient action. A European resolution authority would be able to avoid unnecessary delays and overcome coordination-related constraints. That would also keep the resolution costs low. On the other hand, the use of taxpayers’ money should be limited to exceptional cases. The first step should be to use equity and bail-ins of shareholders and creditors to the greatest extent possible. The next step should then be to tap a European resolution fund financed through bank contributions. Public funds such as those of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) should only be used temporarily in emergencies. Such temporary assistance should be covered by subsequent levies on banks, so that it ultimately has no fiscal policy impact. The European Commission will be submitting draft legislation on a common resolution mechanism at the end of the month. Thereafter, the Member States will need to ensure that we establish an effective resolution mechanism in addition to common supervision. That brings me back to where I started my speech today: it is the Member States who are responsible for finding a lasting solution to the crisis. What the central bank has to do is to ensure that the transmission of monetary policy functions properly again. The instruments we need for doing so are at our disposal. However, our hands are tied where disruptions to the socio-economic transmission mechanism are concerned. Returning to more realistic views when making election promises and both explaining and implementing unpopular measures wherever necessary are the prerogative and responsibility of the – national – political domain. Werner Schneyder, an Austrian political satirist, once said that Europe consists of countries that do not want to be ruled by what they themselves have decided. That must change. Only then will it be possible to sustainably resolve the crisis. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Manuel Sánchez: Mexico in a weak global environment Remarks by Mr Manuel Sánchez, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mexico, at Morgan Stanley’s Mexico’s Moment Investor Conference, Mexico City, 17 June 2013. *      *      * It is a privilege to participate in this conference dedicated to examining investment opportunities in the Mexican economy. I appreciate Morgan Stanley’s invitation to share a few thoughts with you on the economic situation and outlook in Mexico. My remarks will be divided in three parts. First, I will briefly review the status of the Mexican economy in the current context of global economic softness; second, I will analyze recent developments in Mexican financial markets in connection with the monetary policies of developed countries; and third, I will describe some challenges to monetary policy and inflation in Mexico. Developments in the Mexican economy Mexico’s economic performance of this year has been limited by the weakness of the world economy. On the one hand, the United States has shown signs of recovery, confirmed by indicators such as those related to personal consumption, the housing sector, lending, and the labor market. Yet, growth has been dampened by a contraction in public spending, reflecting fiscal consolidation efforts, as well as by a recently lower contribution from net exports. Forward-looking indicators reveal that economic activity in the United States may continue to strengthen. So far this year, analysts’ consensus forecasts posit GDP expansion higher in 2014 than for this year. However, this expected growth is still insufficient for the U.S. economy to return to its secular trend, something that continues to challenge current economic policy. On the other hand, the euro zone remains in recession, despite progress on financial stability. In addition, emerging economies appear to be slowing, as shown by the performance of industrial production and exports. Even if PMIs from the manufacturing and services sectors imply that expansion in these economies will continue, both indicators exhibit a declining trend. In short, global growth forecasts for 2013 have been revised slightly downward, and those for 2014 are unchanged, all remaining below the average rates seen before the crisis.1 So far in 2013, Mexico’s economic output has continued the upturn begun four years ago, although at a slower pace. Moderation in the Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE) stems from stagnation in industry and a contraction in agriculture, the latter largely resulting from March frosts. The lack of strength in manufacturing reflects weakness in the sector’s exports, both those directed to the United States and especially those to other markets. In contrast, the services sector has remained highly dynamic. Lending to the private sector, in particular consumer lending, has kept growing, albeit at lower rates. Additionally, the number of formally employed workers has continued to increase, but the unemployment rate remains somewhat above the historic average.                                                  1  Consensus forecasts for U.S. GDP growth are 1.9 and 2.7 percent for 2013 and 2014, respectively. The world economic growth forecast for 2013 dropped from 2.6 to 2.5 percent between January and June 2013, while estimates for 2014 have remained at 3.2 percent during the same period. See Consensus Economics (2013), Consensus Forecasts, January and June. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Some indicators imply that lower external demand has likely had negative repercussions for domestic spending. Retail sales have lost momentum and gross fixed investment has recently slowed. Nevertheless, most prospective indicators, including the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs and other leading indicators, still suggest that economic performance may improve. Consistently, analysts have revised their forecasts for Mexican GDP growth downward for the current year but, in general, they have kept their forecasts the same for 2014.2 Even though downside risks to near-term growth forecasts appear to have increased for this year, for next year upside risks may remain. In particular, if the recovery in U.S. manufacturing consolidates in the following months, the upswing could fuel manufacturing in Mexico, with favorable effects on other sectors of the economy. In the medium term, economic expansion in Mexico will continue to depend on productivity growth, the lack of which has been the biggest drag on income improvement. Progress on the nation’s structural reform agenda is encouraging, including changes affecting the labor market, government accounting, education, and competition and telecommunications. Finally, approval of a financial reform initiative submitted recently to Congress could yield additional benefits. Capital inflows and financial markets During the last three years, emerging markets saw significant capital inflows, which appear to have accelerated during the first four months of 2013. In Mexico, the largest proportion of flows went to peso-denominated government bonds. The relative abundance of external funds for emerging markets seems to reflect three fundamental factors. First, loose monetary policy in developed nations, which in the case of the United States has implied policy interest rates cut to near zero and significant quantitative easing, has triggered a search for higher yields. Second and not completely unrelated to the preceding factor, global risk aversion has remained relatively tame since 2010. Third, individual characteristics of different countries contribute to explaining why capital inflows have not been equal in all emerging economies. In particular, Mexico’s attractiveness could involve factors such as the openness of the capital account, the free-floating exchange rate regime, the certainty of no discretionary intervention in the markets, moderate country risk, and positive prospects for structural reforms.3 During the last few weeks, sentiment has changed in global financial markets. Favorable U.S. economic data and various Federal Reserve officials’ statements have fueled market and analysts’ expectations for an imminent start to the tapering of quantitative easing in the United States. Hence, the April employment report published in May approximately coincided with the beginning of a rising trend in long-term government bond rates in the United States and other nations. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has been appreciating with respect to many currencies.                                                  2  Economic growth expectations for Mexico in 2013 dropped from 3.6 to 3.0 percent between January and May 2013, while those for 2014 have remained at 4.0 percent during the same period. See Banco de México (2013), Survey of Private-Sector Economic Analysts’ Expectations, May. 3  Two empirical analyses of factors that explain capital flows, including idiosyncratic factors, are Ghosh, A.R., et al. (2012), “Surges,” IMF Working Paper, WP/12/22, January; and Fratzscher, M. (2011), “Capital flows, push versus pull factors and the global financial crisis,” ECB Working Paper Series, No. 1364, July. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 The resulting volatility in global financial markets has brought about considerable increases in Mexican government bond yields. For some maturities, the upward shift in the yield curve has offset the downward shifts seen in the first four months of the year. Like other emerging-market currencies, the peso has been depreciating against the dollar. Adjustments in Mexico’s financial markets have occurred in an orderly way. FX market volumes have continued to be high, bid-ask spreads have remained slim, and foreign holdings of peso-denominated bonds are still near record highs, although portfolio duration has been declining throughout the year. Recent global financial volatility is a foretaste of what could happen when the process of U.S. monetary policy unwinding begins in earnest. Hence, it is likely that some turbulence may continue. Given this scenario, the Mexican economy is expected to confront any new episode of uncertainty in a solid manner. However, it is important that creditors as well as debtors remain wary of their FX and interest-rate risk exposures. At the same time, authorities need to remain vigilant in order to ensure that financial markets operate normally at all times. Inflation and monetary policy In the last decade, monetary policy in Mexico has sought the convergence of inflation toward the 3 percent permanent target. Progress in price stability over the same time has been considerable. Nevertheless, during the current year, inflation has posted somewhat higher levels, since March surpassing the Bank of Mexico’s upper limit in the variability interval of plus or minus one percentage point around its inflation target. Higher inflation mainly reflects pressures in the noncore component of the CPI, from agricultural prices as well as energy prices and government tariffs. However, the negative supply shock is expected to be transitory. At the same time, moderation in core inflation continues to depend, to some degree, on a positive shock from certain services prices. Nevertheless, core inflation has remained around 3 percent during the last few months and is expected to stay around this level during the rest of this year and next. Up to now, there is no evidence of secondary effects from recent changes in relative prices. Analysts’ short-term inflation expectations have increased somewhat, but expectations for the medium and long terms have remained stable, albeit above 3 percent. The Bank of Mexico expects inflation to return to the variability interval in the second half of this year, and to be very close to the permanent target in 2014. Upside risks to inflation prevail, including greater-than-expected hikes to transportation prices, additional agricultural price pressures, given avian flu, low precipitation and reduced water levels in dams, and greater volatility due to uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy normalization. The persistence of higher inflation carries the risk of fueling second-round effects that may contaminate the price and wage formation process. Thus, the Bank of Mexico Governing Board has warned that it will remain alert to adverse supply shocks in order to keep them from producing these effects so that the process of convergence to the permanent inflation target remains on track.4                                                  4  See the Bank of Mexico’s monetary policy announcement, June 7, 2013. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Concluding remarks Recent indicators highlight slower expansion in the Mexican economy, largely caused by global economic weakness. By next year, as the external environment improves, Mexico’s economic activity is expected to post a healthier pace. Also, in the medium term, structural reforms could enhance productivity. The financial volatility of the last few weeks has had significant implications for emerging markets. Adjustments in Mexico have been orderly. In the face of the possibility that uncertainty may continue, prudence should prevail on the part of creditors and debtors, and the authorities should remain alert in order to ensure that at all times financial markets operate normally. Finally, an increase in annual inflation so far this year is due to negative supply shocks, reflected especially in the noncore component of the CPI. Given the temporary nature of recent pressures, it is likely that inflation will soon resume a downward trend toward the 3 percent permanent target. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yves Mersch: Monetary policy in an environment of low growth and interest rates Speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Nordea 3rd Annual Nordic AAA Seminar, Copenhagen, 13 June 2013. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It’s a great pleasure to speak to you at this 3rd Annual Nordic AAA Seminar. Today’s seminar will examine the AAA fixed-income market, considering both the investor and the issuer perspective. It is clear that we as central bankers are closely watching these markets as they are of crucial importance. Take, for instance, the working of monetary policy transmission. The impact of central bank action on the term structure of ‘risk-free’ rates is the backbone for the wider transmission of our monetary policy stance to a broad range of asset prices, to real activity and eventually to price developments. The price level is the ultimate objective of our mandate defined by the Treaty on the Union level which therefore can only be challenged by the European Court of Justice or a Treaty change. Moreover, high-rated sovereign debt also plays a key role in our collateral framework and for the implementation of monetary policy. And finally, the yields on AAA-rated sovereign bonds provide central bankers with a rich set of information about the market’s outlook for inflation or future interest rates. The recent years of crisis have provided two important lessons on sovereign debt markets. First, for sovereign issuers, an AAA rating is not working like an automatic life-time subscription. It must rather be interpreted as an award that requires healthy public finances and sound economic fundamentals in order to keep it. And second, both financial stability and monetary policy transmission could be at risk if the smooth functioning of sovereign debt markets is hampered. In my remarks, I will address three issues from a euro area perspective: • First, I will give you a summary of the current economic environment in the euro area and the outlook for economic activity and inflation. • Second, I will elaborate on our latest monetary policy decisions. • And third, I will address some of the specific questions for our monetary policy. That is on the one hand, the challenges close to the zero lower bound in an environment of slowly receding financial sector fragmentation and very low interest rates. And on the other hand, the challenges arising from keeping interest rates low for too long. But be aware that there is no forward guidance in any of my remarks that would provoke undue volatility. The currently low inflation environment certainly warrants an accommodative monetary policy stance to improve credit conditions in the economy. But we are not the only player in this game. Engineering a broad based recovery and returning to sustained growth in the euro area can only be based on the appropriate structural policy efforts. Subdued price pressure over the medium term, economic activity expected to stabilise slowly Let me start with the current economic conditions in the euro area which show a combination of subdued underlying price pressure, a shallow recovery of economic activity and weak credit dynamics. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In the euro area, the output has continued to shrink in the first quarter of the year, so that we have now witnessed a decrease in gross domestic product (GDP) output for the sixth quarter in a row. Confirming this bleak picture, the unemployment rate has stayed in double digit territory. On a somewhat more positive note, economic sentiment appears to be slowly picking up from low levels. Looking ahead until the end of next year, the Governing Council expects euro area export growth to benefit from the recovery in global demand. Turning to price developments, euro area headline inflation stood at 1.4 percent in May. Our definition of price stability is a positive inflation rate below 2 percent. As capacity utilisation is low and the economic recovery is expected to be slow, we expect price pressure to remain subdued. Inflation expectations are well anchored. Finally, the dynamics of loans to the private sector is still very feeble in the euro area. The weakness in current and expected economic activity is certainly an important factor in depressing loan dynamics to the private sector in the euro area economy. The need for deleveraging for several banks, corporations and households is further dragging on growth dynamics. On top of that some borrowers are still facing elevated costs of financing, which also differ strongly across the euro area. While fragmentation on the funding side has receded, this cannot be said of lending activity to the real economy. Focusing on euro area banks’ lending policies – the supply side of loans – credit risk and macroeconomic uncertainty remain their main concerns, according to the last wave of our Bank Lending Survey in April. In addition, the need for further balance sheet adjustment across sectors has certainly contributed to the slow pace in the provision of loans. Euro area monetary policy remains accommodative What I just described was a sketch of the situation which we saw in the ECB’s Governing Council last Thursday: On this basis, we decided that our monetary policy stance should remain accommodative as long as necessary and we kept interest rates unchanged. Beyond this decision on rates, there is an on-going debate on further measures the ECB could take, if necessary, to provide additional accommodation or improve funding conditions, although, as I mentioned, fragmentation on the funding side is of lesser concern than on the lending side. This debate has taken a broad scope, including for instance: measures to revitalise the market for Asset Backed Securities; additional long-term refinancing operations; enhancing the framework for additional credit claims; and broader or targeted changes in collateral policies. All these limited measures are under study or theoretically available on the shelf. It is in this context, that also the issue of setting a negative rate on the deposit facility has come up. Speaking here in Denmark today, I would like to say a few more words on our decision on the level of that deposit facility rate. Some commentators wondered whether we would consider taking this rate to negative territory, and many of those drew comparisons to the Danish case, where the central bank had decreased the rate on certificates of deposits to minus 20 basis points in July 2012. The possibly negative deposit rate is one facet of the so-called “Zero Lower Bound” debate. While this concept enjoyed some prominence in the academic literature for several years, it seems to have now spread into something routinely discussed in taxi-drive small talks. At first sight, the term “Zero Lower Bound” seems to provide for an unambiguous metric: once the relevant monetary policy rate is zero, it cannot fall any further. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  One reasoning behind this is that any type of nominal interest rate cannot fall below zero. Anybody holding an asset with such negative remuneration would simply switch to cash. Then he would ‘at least’ earn a nominal return of zero. However, this reasoning may be incomplete. One example is the case of negative deposit certificate rates at the Danish central bank that I already mentioned. So obviously, under certain circumstances, some assets provide particular services that make market participants willing to hold these assets although they display negative interest rates. To understand the nature of the question on possible negative deposit rates in the euro area, let me quickly recall that the ECB operates a corridor system consisting of three rates. First, the main refinancing rate is the interest the ECB charges in the main refinancing operations with its counterparties. It usually provides the mid-point of the corridor system. Second, the marginal lending rate is the interest charged on overnight lending from the Eurosystem to banks. It constitutes the ceiling of the corridor system. Third, the deposit facility rate governs the remuneration for excess reserves that our counterparties hold with the Eurosystem as overnight deposits. It constitutes the floor to the corridor system. Moreover, it also provides the floor on interbank market rates as banks have no incentive to lend funds below this rate in the market. Setting the deposit rate to a value below zero would imply that the remuneration for excess reserves in the euro area is negative. In other words, banks are charged for making overnight deposits with the ECB. From a technical point of view, we are ready to implement a negative deposit facility rate. And, in general, there are constellations conceivable where the Eurosystem could deploy such a negative rate, if it is deemed required by our mandate to safeguard price stability. So what are the pros and cons? Theoretically, a negative deposit rate may provide additional accommodation. In the current environment of excess liquidity, the relevant overnight interest rates have shifted close to the deposit rate. In this situation, reductions in the deposit rate could push down overnight interest rates further. At the same time, possible caveats and unintended side effects of this move have to be kept in mind. In particular, crossing the zero line can set off actions in the market that may run counter to the central bank’s policy easing intentions. For example, there can be a substitution by private actors towards cash which becomes the highest yielding short-term asset. Similarly, the money-holding sector may promote financial innovations that could emulate currency and allow tax avoidance. These actions may undermine the underlying purpose of the move towards negative deposit rates. Overall, the consequences are subject to considerable margins of uncertainty as such a move has never been observed in the Eurosystem or in any other major currency area in the world. How do these considerations differ from those underlying the move by Denmark’s or the Swiss central bank? Both countries apply a fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro area. In contrast, the ECB does not consider the euro exchange rate as a policy target. This adds an additional complexity to the monetary policy objective function. What could be the effects of introducing a negative deposit facility rate on the euro exchange rate? One can in principle single out three factors that would be at work. First, the traditional interest rate differential channel could exert a downward pressure on the euro. Second, a signalling effect may amplify this downward pressure, as market participants would see a realisation of a completely new scenario, which they had previously priced in as a mere 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  possibility. At the same time, an improvement of macroeconomic prospects – the very intention of that policy move in the first place – would possibly exert upward pressure on the exchange rate. Overall, also for the exchange rate, any gauge of the impact of a move to a negative deposit facility rate might be subject to considerable uncertainty. Also the historical experience is of limited help: the few instances of such policy movements happened under different economic constellations and for central banks that worked under different monetary policy paradigms. So, in conclusion, we are in a situation of a professional golfer who has a huge set of specialised clubs at his disposal – and he is in principle able to master them all. He will then draw the most suitable one depending on the position of the ball and the landscape he is facing. That is, negative rates are in our bag of tools, but may or may not be deployed depending on the economic landscape. This applies to all other tools and measures that I mentioned before as well. In this context, our monetary policy strategy provides the necessary flexibility to react to different economic and market constellations. This flexibility derives from our medium-term policy horizon and the definition of price stability. It is defined not as a point target but as a range of permissible inflation outcomes. These two elements of flexibility ensure that we do not have to mechanically react to temporary shifts of prices. Instead, we can adopt a steady hand approach. This avoids policy-induced volatility. Challenges to monetary policy in an environment of fragmentation and the implications of protractedly low interest rates This brings me to my third and last part: where do we stand and what are the challenges that we are facing in the euro area? Since the outset of the financial crisis in 2007, we had to adjust and expand our toolkit in order to be optimally equipped in serving our objective of price stability amid evolving challenges. The biggest challenge that we saw during the last year, I would summarize that with the term ‘fragmentation’. What is behind this? Recall that our objective is to safeguard price stability for the euro area as a whole. However, fragmentation in financing conditions means that for two firms with the same credit risk, the financing conditions would depend on the area of residence. The same holds for private households. As a result, our monetary policy stance is not transmitted homogeneously in all parts of the euro area. In other words, before the crisis, an interest rate cut of 25 basis points was passed through to bond yields, bank deposit rates and lending rates in a similar fashion throughout the euro area. Now, this pass-through has become smaller on average and its effect very disparate across jurisdictions. One of the main factors contributing to fragmentation was the increasingly perceived risk that the euro area might break up and some countries would return to a domestic currency – the so-called redenomination risk. Such fears manifested themselves as undue and sizeable spread surcharges in sovereign bond yields. But it also affected all sorts of other financial asset prices, such as corporate bond yields and other financing rates, through various contagion channels. So if ‘fragmentation’ is the one word characterizing the main threat to our stability-oriented monetary policy, one of our most successful answers to it can be summarized in only three letters: OMT. This stands for the programme of Outright Monetary Transactions. OMT keeps up all motivation of the respective countries for consolidation and the necessary structural reforms. This ‘incentive-preserving’ feature of OMT results from the implied conditionality as well as from the fact that after the removal of the excessive ‘panic’ component of bond yield spreads, capital markets can exert their disciplining function via sovereign debt pricing. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Finally, although not a single Euro has been spent on OMT yet, the programme has been highly successful already. Let me give you a few examples, where the OMT announcement has certainly contributed to positive developments, while – of course – it cannot be singled out as the sole responsible factor: Sovereign bond spreads for stressed jurisdictions came down from the excessive levels observed in summer 2012; sovereign bond yields in core countries also normalised by moving upwards reflecting a reversal of previously extreme flight-to-safety flows; bank deposits have been slowly flowing into peripheral countries; banks’ recourse to Eurosystem financing has decreased; corporate bond spreads and financial market volatility has come down; and TARGET balances – the aggregate gross claims of national central banks against the Eurosystem – have also decreased. While this improvement is certainly welcome, we are facing two challenges: first, significant fragmentation – while mitigated – remains. Second, we must be wary of the potential side effects of our monetary policy. In fact, the partial relaxation in financial markets, which I mentioned, has already induced some commentators to ventilate the idea that we may face renewed exaggerations – not unlike the underpricing of risk that we have seen before the crisis in some market segments. Some even assert that the protracted period of low interest rates could by itself be a factor to trigger such distortions. In fact, a low-interest-rate environment may in principle spur an underpricing of certain risks, support the emergence of asset price bubbles, or provide incentives to delay certain adjustments in bank balance sheets with the risk of zombie-banking and evergreening. However, in the euro area we do not see evidence of broad-based mis-alignments in asset prices. As a case in point, common valuation metrics of major stock price valuation levels are near their historical averages – rather than exaggerated as was the case in earlier low-rate periods. At the same time, there is no reason for complacency, and a future build-up of imbalances in certain market segments cannot be excluded. But this is exactly the field where macroprudential authorities have to be alert and intervene with market-specific instruments. So, let me repeat in this context my appreciation for the micro- and macroprudential policies at EU and national level that are underway. Regarding the required balance sheet adjustments the benign market environment should rather be a supportive factor for that. Decent stock market valuation levels, for instance, tend to decrease the cost of capital. That’s helpful for re-capitalisation. Moreover, banks’ balance sheets will be scrutinized upon transition to the Single Supervisory Mechanism – once the required backstop for possible recapitalisation needs will be in place. In any case, the level of our policy rate has to be always understood as reflecting our best attempt of safeguarding price stability in the euro area as a whole. I think, in this respect, the single objective is a very important guide post to anchor inflation expectations, but also to make transparent and traceable the trajectory of our rate setting. Conclusion and outlook Let me conclude. Almost six years after the outbreak of the financial crisis in summer 2007 the economic situation in the euro area is far from back to normal. Unemployment is high in several member states, growth is expected to return only gradually and credit to the real economy is reaching the real economy fairly reluctantly overall and at different speed levels across euro area countries. Following its objective of safeguarding price stability, the ECB had to activate a variety of non-standard measures to improve the transmission of its accommodative monetary policy stance. However, we are still operating in a difficult 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  environment and fragmentation of financing conditions across the euro area is one of the most prevalent problems. So let me finish with some key messages that, I think, characterise the policy landscape in the time to come: 1. Monetary policy has helped to prevent economic outcomes to be even worse than what we see today. Monetary policy accommodation is needed to keep prices in line with the ECB’s definition of price stability. 2. The ECB has not run out of ammunition. We can employ more tools and measures whenever they will be needed. 3. But monetary policy has limits: it is not effective when it comes to structural issues and we should keep in mind the challenges that arise from keeping interest rates too low for too long. Therefore we should not forget about the responsibilities of other policy areas: 1. A properly designed banking union is essential to restore financial integration and to support a new steady state where bank balance sheets will be fit for lending 2. Fiscal consolidation is required to spur and maintain confidence of consumers and investors 3. Structural reforms are key to bring euro area economies back on a sustainable growth path. For the ECB, the different crisis modes required various modifications in our tool box of monetary policy instruments. But our objective of price stability remained time-invariant. It has served as an anchor of stability in the euro area during the crisis; it is helping the transition to a new steady state of a better-integrated euro area economy; and it will certainly remain our guiding principle in the future. Thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Gill Marcus: Celebrating what is good about South Africa and its economy Address by Ms Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, to the FM Top Companies awards function, Johannesburg, 26 June 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me to address the FM Top Companies awards function. It is an honour to be part of a tribute to the best companies in our country. It is appropriate that, at a time when much of the economic news is gloomy, we hold our heads high and celebrate what is good about our country and our economy. South Africa has a sound economic foundation and hundreds, if not thousands, of firms and business leaders that are outstanding in any context. It is a major source of strength that South Africa has a large number of companies that continue to grow, innovate, employ people and generate revenue and export earnings for our country. It is even more impressive that in times of very difficult and uncertain economic conditions, both globally and locally, many firms are performing so well. You and your firms are a significant reason why we can proudly say that while our economy faces many challenges, it is also highly resilient. We are here today to recognise these firms and their achievements. The economic environment is a difficult one. The world is in its sixth year of crisis: a crisis that has repeatedly mutated, shifting its epicentre from a sub-prime crisis to systemic banking crisis; a liquidity, fiscal deficit and sovereign debt crisis. Measures taken to address each of these elements have had unintended consequences. Austerity measures have contributed to an unemployment crisis of immense proportions, particularly for the young. There will probably be at least one or two more forms of the crisis before we can safely say that recovery is sustainable. And even then, as we can see in the United States where there are signs of recovery, the measures that are outlined to be taken very cautiously and with considerable conditionality, such as a tapering off of Quantitative Easing, have also had unintended consequences. As we have seen in recent days and weeks, the exchange rates of many emerging market economies have been impacted negatively by an outflow of capital. This development could well mark the start of a new mutation of the ongoing global crisis. If things do not get any worse it will probably still take a number of years before the world is back to more normal growth and output gaps are fully closed. Even then, there is debate about whether that new normal would be at a lower rate of growth than in the past. All in all, it is a very uncertain and difficult decade for individuals, companies and countries. South Africa’s weak first quarter annualised growth rate of 0,9 per cent is, to some extent, consistent with what we see happening globally and in other emerging markets and these developments have, in part, contributed towards a weaker rand exchange rate. But domestic factors have also contributed. These have to do with lost production in the mining sector, instability caused by violent and often illegal strike action and persistent capacity constraints in infrastructure, electricity in particular. The source of this vulnerability is primarily a large current account deficit, a high budget deficit, rising public debt and relatively low foreign exchange reserves as well as high household indebtedness and inflation close to the top of the target range – all suggesting limited room for fiscal or monetary support. South Africa is actively taking measures to stabilise the labour relations environment led by President Zuma who, in his budget vote speech, set out concrete steps to diffuse labour tension and ensure that labour disputes are conducted peacefully and within our legal 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  framework. President Zuma also focused on the structural reforms that are being implemented, within the framework of the National Development Plan, to ensure higher and more inclusive growth going forward. Currently the financial markets appear to be confused about the monetary policy reaction function. This is not altogether surprising, as monetary policy is facing an extremely difficult dilemma. On the one hand, slowing growth with a downside risk, and the widening output gap should signal the need for further monetary accommodation, given the absence of significant demand pressures in the economy. These conditions have already resulted in the Bank being more tolerant of inflation at the upper end of the target range than would normally have been the case. This is consistent with a flexible inflation targeting framework. On the other hand, we are seeing increasingly strong upside risks to the inflation outlook, primarily coming from exchange rate developments. Had these pressures been simply a result of excess demand pressures, the response would have been relatively straight-forward. But this is not the case. There are a number of issues that we have to consider in our decision making: to what extent is the depreciation going to be sustained? Will the currency continue to depreciate, settle at current levels or has it overshot in which case it will strengthen at some stage? This is critical in terms of the extent of the pass-through to inflation. We have observed that the pass-through thus far has been far more muted than has been the case in previous episodes of currency weakness, possibly also a reflection of the weak state of the economy. We have to assess whether the pass-through remains as low as it has been, or will we reach a stage where the margins of importers can no longer be squeezed? Furthermore, if there is a spike in inflation as a result of the depreciation, is it a one-off increase that will pass through the numbers by next year, or will it generate a depreciation-inflation spiral? Most importantly, will inflation expectations remain relatively contained at current levels? These are not easy issues to determine with confidence, and have been complicated by the strong market reaction to the suggestion that the US Fed may begin slowing the pace of its bond-buying programme. Our core mandate remains price stability, so our primary objective is to keep inflation within the target range. Currently our forecasts (and those of nearly all private sector analysts) suggest that inflation is likely to remain at the top of the band or slightly above, and then to return to within the target range. The downside risks to the growth outlook would suggest that we should tolerate inflation at these levels. However, the upside risks to the inflation outlook make further accommodation more difficult, but do not automatically imply a tightening of the monetary policy stance. This will be highly dependent on how we see the inflation trajectory unfolding in this very uncertain environment. In other words, it has become even more data dependent. There is of course always the danger that we are “behind the curve” and that we leave it too late (and this we will only know ex post). But at the same time, a sustained breach of the inflation target is not our central forecast, and the downside risks to growth imply that we would not want to be unnecessarily pre-emptive. This is the essence of the monetary policy dilemma, and requires a fine balancing act. As already mentioned, South Africa’s high quality firms are a key source of strength for the South African economy. South Africa is a vibrant, robust democracy with a sound Constitution that protects the rights of all citizens. This is essential for long term economic growth and for the fruits of that growth to be shared more equitably. There are several other economic foundation-stones which will help us navigate through these difficult times. South Africa’s macroeconomic policies are sound, clear and transparent. Our macroeconomic institutions enjoy a high degree of credibility and respect, both globally and locally. Flexible inflation targeting has helped anchor inflation expectations and has provided the Reserve Bank with some scope to support economic growth. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Allow me to list at least five additional strengths and opportunities for the South African economy: • South Africa’s emerging middle class is a source of strength, contributing to rising consumption, the creation of new firms and greater social stability. • Our proximity to high growth African countries is already having a positive impact on our exports. • Our natural resources, both mineral and natural beauty, provide huge potential for investment in mining, agriculture, tourism and niche manufacturing sectors. • South Africa’s financial services sector is a recognised strength, with the country ranked in the top three in the world in the regulation of securities exchanges, soundness of our banking sector and access to financial services as part of a considered policy of financial inclusion. • The efficacy of our legal framework and the strength of our auditing and accounting capacity provide a conducive environment for the private sector to operate in. I can list many more areas where steady progress is being made. These strengths are a cause for optimism for our economy and reflect the significant potential for growth, employment creation and shared economic prosperity for all in our country. South Africa’s infrastructure programme has the potential to crowd in the private sector to expand investment and employment. Investments in electricity, renewable energy, freight rail, ports, water, roads and telecommunications will enhance the capacity of the economy, enabling faster growth as well as improve the efficiency of private firms. Two examples are worth mentioning here. First, adequate electricity provision is critical. We know that at present we cannot grow at a rate much in excess of 3 per cent without hitting against electricity supply constraints. We are also aware that certain investment projects do not get off the ground because of lack of certainty of electricity supply. Thus new energy capacity must be brought on stream as soon as possible, and on-going investment in sustainable energy capacity remains an imperative. Second, we have invested in a world-class road infrastructure in Gauteng which has already had a major impact on economic efficiencies. According to an independent study, the overall average travel time on the N1 north road section between Buccleuch and the Old Johannesburg highway has been reduced by 50 per cent to 13 minutes. The improved travel time and travel speeds come despite a 28 per cent increase in traffic volumes since the implementation of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Programme. Furthermore, petrol consumption has also declined as less time is spent idling on the highways, not to mention improved road safety and reduced vehicle running costs. The need for and benefit of such economic efficiencies brought about through an expanded infrastructure programme cannot be overestimated. Investment in infrastructure is for the benefit of both current and future generations, and should provide the private sector with a longer term time horizon, encouraging private investment, which has been very weak over the past few years. We hope that the private sector will respond appropriately, and public-private partnerships should be promoted in the process. Growth in gross fixed capital formation is currently led by state owned enterprises, but for South Africa to reach its growth potential the private sector’s role is essential. In general, the private sector contributes around two thirds of such investment. Gross fixed capital formation as a ratio to GDP presently stands at 19 per cent, down from a high of 23 per cent in 2008, and compared for instance with that of Indonesia, a fast-growing emerging market, where it stands at over 30 per cent. South Africa’s infrastructure programme will have benefits for many sectors in the economy. Going beyond South Africa, Africa’s infrastructure investment increased from about 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  US$10 billion in 2000 to about US$45 billion in 2010, and is set to rise to US$93 billion a year by 2020. South African construction firms are well placed to be an integral part of these opportunities in our region. In the 1960s, Korean construction firms won large contracts to build roads in South East Asia. These firms sourced their inputs from South Korean manufacturers, providing the first growth stimulus for them. Similarly, South African construction firms can grow their order books globally and use a proportion of South Africa material and capital equipment, stimulating our manufacturing sector. Long term growth requires a partnership between the public and private sectors, which requires a much longer horizon. Too often we are caught up in the paralysis of short-termism. A long term perspective requires policy certainty, trust in institutions and confidence in the longer term growth outlook. There is increased recognition within the private sector that sustainable earnings growth requires such a longer term horizon and the chase for short term returns is not always consistent with longer term sustainable growth. At least some of our woes in the mining sector arise from a degree of short termism amongst all stakeholders in the sector. Before the era of global capital markets, mining companies were able to adjust to the volatility of commodity prices. When prices were high, they were able to accumulate cash on their balance sheets. They saved this money for times when prices would fall. More recently, shareholders penalised companies for keeping large piles of cash on their balance sheets. This resulted in large dividend payments. In turn, management took large bonuses when prices were high. Workers too demanded higher salary increases when commodity prices were high. When prices fell, mining companies made losses and there was no cushion. It becomes much more difficult for a company to raise capital when they are making losses. Similarly, management bonuses and workers’ salaries are sticky. The necessity of taking a longer term perspective does not just apply to shareholders and fixed capital investment. It also applies to human resource management. South African firms spend a lower proportion of their revenue training their staff than comparable firms in other countries. For all firms globally, staff development is a win-win investment helping to raise productivity and make work more meaningful and interesting for individuals. In a country such as ours where so many were denied adequate education, firms play a crucial role in training their staff. We need to remember that lack of education, or poor education, is the greatest exclusion there can be. In many cases, it is not the absolute salary that workers feel aggrieved about. It is the lack of a career-path and opportunities to move up the ladder that is the source of frustration. Peter Drucker, one of the fathers of theories on management, wrote in The New Realities (1989): “Management’s fundamental task is to make people capable of joint performance through common goals, common values, the right structure, and the training and development they need to perform and to respond to change”. To bring several strands of my talk together, I refer to two studies, one by the IMF and the other by the OECD, into how countries can avoid the middle income trap, which is defined as a period of slower growth or even stagnation when countries reach a GDP per capita of between US$5,000 and US$10,000 (in PPP terms). These studies suggest that to break out of this middle income trap, countries need to move from being adapters of technology to being producers of technology. Countries that move up the value chain to capture a larger share of the intellectual property or innovation succeed in breaking the trap. While South Africa’s expenditure on Research and Development (R&D) has increased in the past decade, the country still lags its peers. R&D expenditure in South Africa amounts to about 0,9 per cent of GDP, well below the 2,3 per cent average for OECD countries. In most countries, about two thirds of R&D spending is undertaken by the private sector, but in almost all cases there are strong institutional links between firms, higher education 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  institutions and science councils contributing to both higher levels of research spending and more domestic commercialisation of the ideas and innovations. South Africa has many innovative firms that are able to compete with the best in the world. The most successful firms take a long term perspective, invest in their people and take innovation seriously. Allow me to quote Sipho Nkosi, the CEO of Exxaro: “We spend money on innovation and research and development because we believe that companies focusing on this will survive in the future and will have an advantage over those that don’t innovate.” The studies referred to also suggest that the presence of local firms that have a global footprint are critical to this process. Countries that have firms with strong global brands are more likely to move up the value chain. This is partly because so much of the value addition in the world economy today rests in research and development, innovation, branding and marketing, and logistics and distribution. How relevant is such a strategy for South Africa? On the one hand, South Africa has large numbers of poorly skilled people either unemployed or employed doing relatively low productivity jobs. On the other hand, we have sophisticated firms who operate at the cutting edge of global innovation with highly skilled staff. South Africa needs to pursue both strategies. We must grow our mining, agriculture, manufacturing and tourism sectors where we have significant comparative advantage. Parts of these sectors are also labour intensive and require relatively low skilled workers. Growth in these sectors has the potential to create millions of jobs. At the same time, South Africa needs its firms to develop brands and technologies that it can export. We are already well placed in many respects in telecommunications, banking, retail, brewing, construction and mining and we have firms with a significant global presence and strong brands. These firms generate significant export earnings for South Africa through the provision of knowledge services. For example, in 2011, South Africa exported US$7 billion worth of mining equipment and had a trade surplus of US$472 million in mining equipment. Such exports have strong backward linkages to our own manufacturing sector. By 2050, the world will need to produce about 80 per cent more food than today to satisfy growing populations and rising food consumption. Africa contains the largest proportion of underutilised arable land on the planet. This provides a huge opportunity for investment, not just in agriculture but in agro-processing, in water management, in roads and ports and in cold storage facilities. South African firms in the agricultural and agro-processing sector have the expertise, the knowhow and the capital to invest in food production and processing on the continent. Again, there are strong backward linkages between such investments abroad and jobs back home. Ladies and gentlemen, yes these are difficult economic times. We have strong firms that significantly contribute to South Africa’s economic development. From our perspective at the Bank, we will endeavour to maintain a sound and predictable macroeconomic framework and enhance our economic environment. South Africa’s progress requires firms and businesses to become partners in development. Growing firms mean a growing economy and a growing economy is essential for firms to grow. These are mutually reinforcing developments. I am inspired by the successes of South African firms domestically, on the African continent and globally. We have high calibre business leaders who are smart, professional and innovative. We need closer ties and partnerships across our economy to raise our growth level and to make our growth more inclusive. Our appeal to you is to continue with your good work, take a longer term perspective and invest in people and technology to drive higher and more inclusive growth and reduce the unacceptably high income differentials. I am confident that through such partnership, drawing on our many strengths as a nation, South Africa will grow and continue to prosper.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile: Uganda’s financial sector at 50 – achievements, challenges and expectations for the future Remarks by Mr Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the annual general meeting of the Uganda Institute of Banking and Financial Services, Kampala, 14 June 2013. *      *      * The Board Chairperson of the Uganda Institute of Banking and Financial Services Members of the Board of Directors of the Institute, Members of the Institute present, CEOs of Financial Institutions and all Bankers Present, Invited Guests in your respective capacities, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to address this AGM of the Uganda Institute of Banking and Financial Services. I will begin by thanking the Board and members of the Institute for arranging the AGM and for their choice of theme: “Uganda’s financial sector at 50; Achievements, Challenges and Expectations for the future” which is clearly very pertinent for everyone involved in the sector. In keeping with this theme, I want to share with you my thoughts on what I believe are the most pressing challenges facing the financial services industry in Uganda today. These are challenges which must be confronted if the industry is to contribute fully to our efforts to transform the structure of the economy and move it towards middle income status. I would like to highlight three issues in particular; the need to reduce interest rate spreads in the banking industry; strengthening the financing of small and medium scale enterprises and the diversification of our financial sector. The regional Financial Sector Assessment Program, which was conducted in May of this year, showed that bank interest rate spreads in Uganda are the highest in the East African region after Burundi and among the highest in the world. The interest rate spread in Uganda in 2012 was 15 percent, compared to less than 12 percent in both Kenya and Tanzania. Spreads are high mainly because of heavy overheard costs and high profits earned by banks. Overheads and profits before tax accounted for 42 percent and 28 percent of banks’ gross income respectively in the 12 months ending in March of this year. Unless we can reduce spreads, it will be very difficult to bring bank lending rates down to levels which are more affordable for borrowers. To reduce interest rate spreads it will be necessary for banks to cut overheads as a share of their income, by becoming more efficient. The banking industry is very profitable in Uganda: the average return on assets earned over the last 12 months was 3.6 percent. But banks should also recognize that high lending rates, although they enable large profits to be made in the short run, may damage the long run prospects for the banking industry if they stifle the growth of bank lending to the private sector. Since the turn of the millennium, bank intermediation has grown dramatically in Uganda. Credit to the private sector has risen from 6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 14 percent of GDP today. This is an important achievement which demonstrates that the banking industry has strengthened its contribution to the broader economy. Nevertheless, there are still important gaps in the credit market which will have to be closed. In particular, many small and medium scale enterprises still struggle to obtain the finance they need, in the forms which are most appropriate, to support their business activities and investment requirements. Part of the reason for this lies with the borrowers themselves, especially with regard to poor business 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  management. But banks also have a contribution to make in enhancing access to credit by small and medium scale enterprises; for example by strengthening their capacities for evaluating the business prospects and creditworthiness of loan applicants and by developing new ways of securing loans to business enterprises. Although the financial sector in Uganda has grown strongly since the turn of the millennium, less progress has been made in terms of diversification. The growth of the non bank financial sector, with the exception of NSSF, has been rather disappointing. Our insurance industry, for example, is only a fifth of the size of its counterpart in Kenya in terms of assets. As our economy expands and becomes more sophisticated, I believe that demand for non bank financial products, such as life insurance, will increase. Consequently, unless the financial sector can diversify its product range to meet this demand, customers in Uganda might be forced to look to firms elsewhere in the region to purchase financial services. I hope that the forthcoming amendments to the Financial Institutions Act, which will allow banks to undertake bancassurance in partnership with insurance companies and to offer Islamic financial products to their customers, together with the liberalization of the pensions industry, will help to stimulate the diversification of our financial sector. With these remarks, I would like to thank the Management and Board of Directors of the Uganda Institute of Banking and Financial Services for giving me an opportunity to speak at this year’s AGM. I also want to wish all of the stakeholders in the financial services industry the best of luck for the next fifty years. We have together overcome enormous challenges in the first fifty years of independence, especially in the 1970s and 1980s when the economy collapsed. The industry hung on and survived during the economic turmoil of those years and then rose, Phoenix like, to recover in the 1990s. With the same spirit of enterprise, hard work and cooperation we can help to ensure that the next half century is one of prosperity, sustainable growth and structural transformation for the Ugandan economy. Thank you very much for listening. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Christian Noyer: The euro area perspectives Keynote speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the IIF (Institute of International Finance) 2013 Spring Membership Meeting, Paris, 26 June 2013. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to such a distinguished audience and I thank the President for his invitation. In the light of the discussion you have just had on “The Future of Europe”, I wish to first give you an overview of the current economic and financial situation in the euro area and then discuss the major changes currently underway that are considerably strengthening our monetary union. 1. Overview of the current economic and financial situation in the euro area. Before I start this overview, I would like to quote a famous sentence by Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of Europe: “what matters is neither to be optimistic nor pessimistic, what matters is to be determined”. In other words, what the euro area needs is neither euro-bashing nor celebration, but awareness and action. As you all know, overall growth in the euro area has been very weak for a few years. The most recent figure is a 0.2% contraction in GDP in the first quarter of 2013, following a decline of 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Output has thus declined for six consecutive quarters, with labour market conditions remaining very weak. The euro area economies were badly affected by the crisis (first financial, then economic, then sovereign debt), and the fiscal adjustment that became necessary to overcome it has had a negative impact on growth as well. ECB projections see a gradual recovery taking shape later this year. A number of elements support this view: • Our accommodative monetary policy stance – which will remain so for as long as necessary – should contribute to underpinning this recovery; • Recent developments in economic sentiment survey data have shown some improvement from their low levels; • Looking ahead to later in the year and to 2014, euro area export growth should benefit from a recovery in global demand, while domestic demand should be supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance and by the recent real income gains due to lower oil prices and lower overall inflation. • Furthermore, the significant improvements in financial markets seen since last summer boost confidence and generate wealth effects and should work their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. Nevertheless, the Governing Council continues to see downside risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area. They include the possibility of weaker-than-expected domestic and global demand and the slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. Overall, the June 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual real GDP declining by 0.6% in 2013 and increasing by 1.1% in 2014 thanks to three main drivers: export growth, accommodative monetary policy and low inflation. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  2. How can we boost growth further in the euro area? A strong fiscal stimulus obviously appears unfeasible, given the necessity to rebalance public finances. I want to stress two things here: • The euro area has very rapidly and efficiently set to work to cure its fiscal weaknesses and can today boast some of the best results among the major developed economic regions: its public deficit has been reduced from 6.3% of GDP in 2009 to approximately 3% today; by the end of 2013, the euro area should show a positive primary balance; • While the commitment to progressively achieve sustainable levels of public debt and deficit has to be achieved; the measures need to be designed in such a way as to limit the negative side-effects on growth. For instance, efforts need to be focused on non-productive spending. In fact, there is only one way to durably raise the growth potential of our economies, and that is by structural reforms that enhance competitiveness. It is clear that the euro area is well equipped to confront the challenges of the 21st century. With 370 million consumers and high purchasing power, it remains the biggest market in the world. It is also the most economically integrated area, with highly qualified manpower and very good infrastructures. Too often, however, euro area countries are prevented from reaping the benefits of their position by the rigidities that have accumulated over time, during the periods of easy growth. Now, the international environment is more challenging: new and powerful competitors have emerged and comparative advantages are shifting. There is no alternative to adjustment. In this field too, the euro area has made considerable progress over recent years, especially in the countries that had a particularly large competitiveness gap vis-à-vis the rest of the zone and which, as a result, fell deeper into the crisis than their neighbours: • We have seen a significant improvement in cost competitiveness as measured by unit labour costs (ULC). Between 2008 and 2012, in the three programme countries (Greece, Portugal and Ireland) cumulated ULC growth stood about 12 percentage points below the euro area average. • The current account balances clearly show a strong correction. In the three programme countries, the current account balances as a percentage of GDP improved by more than 9 percentage points between 2008 and 2012. In Spain, the current account deficit improved by more than 7 percentage points over the same period. Most of the adjustment has been driven by a contraction in domestic demand. However, in Ireland, Spain and Portugal export performance has been very strong compared with the pre-crisis period. In total, the euro area generated a trade surplus of more than 1% of its GDP in 2012 compared with around zero in previous years. We expect this surplus to continue growing in the coming years. The speed and depth of the reforms underway in euro area economies is unprecedented. They have undertaken reforms in the areas most important for competitiveness, growth and the sustainability of public finances such as labour markets, products markets, social security, pension systems, etc. These reforms are a prerequisite for dynamic and sustainable growth in the future and they must be vigorously pursued. In addition to this very clear determination at the different national levels to reduce deficits and introduce the necessary reforms, Europe has equipped itself with a new disciplinary framework. The Heads of State signed a new fiscal compact over a year ago that fixes very strict rules and gives very extensive powers to the European Commission to assess the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  compliance of Member States. This new compact goes hand in hand with the introduction of rules for monitoring macroeconomic imbalances. It is important to understand what these institutional advances represent: in effect, they represent a new Treaty creating very strong commitments for the States via rules that are far better calibrated and far more binding than those in place when European monetary union began. 3. Monetary Union is to be enhanced with a banking union. As well as being a year that saw a considerable strengthening of fiscal and macroeconomic discipline in Europe, 2012 also saw significant progress towards a banking union. Why has a banking union suddenly become such an indispensable and urgent project? Simply because we are now certain that many of the problems we have experienced, could have been avoided with a banking union. A banking union is necessary for the smooth functioning of a monetary union for the following three reasons: • It breaks the link between banks and sovereigns by bringing banking supervision and crisis management to the federal level. With the banking union, banks will be considered as euro area institutions over and above their nationality; it will ensure that credit conditions in the euro area will not depend on where you are but on who you are, which is what should be expected of an efficient financial market. • It allows re-integration of the European banking system. A supra-national supervisor is in fact better placed to assess the risks of cross-border activities and therefore to protect and encourage such activities; it is not subject to national biases that can lead to the temptation of economic introversion. It is therefore more credible and strengthens stability and confidence in the area; • Moreover, it restores the full efficacy of monetary policy. If our monetary policy impulses are not transmitted uniformly to all of the area’s countries because of the bank-sovereign link, it undermines the very foundation of Europe’s monetary union; remember that three quarters of the financing of the euro area’s economy consists of bank loans. By breaking this link, a banking union would restore the federal dimension of monetary policy. Today the first pillar of the banking union is being constructed: the Single Supervisory Mechanism. We are currently working on legal issues, on identifying systemically important banks within the euro area, on the supervisory model, on the future data reporting and, of course, on the asset quality review that will be undertaken before we take on the responsibility of supervision. The governance structure we have adopted will guarantee that, while the Governing Council will keep the decision power, there will be no conflict of interest between monetary policy and banking supervision. On the contrary, more consistent supervision across the euro area should allow for the early detection of potential risks and imbalances and, ultimately, improve the transmission of monetary policy. This is a fundamental first step and its rapid implementation will be a major success for the euro area. But, alone, it cannot achieve the objectives of a banking union. That is why we must rapidly construct its two other pillars: a supranational bank resolution authority and a unified deposit insurance system. The banking union will deliver a higher level of structural coherence to the euro area’s financial system, which has already been considerably strengthened since 2008: banks’ capital levels have been substantially consolidated, certain activities have been streamlined and the most stressed banks have been restructured. Recent numbers show major advances for European banks in their efforts to strengthen their capital base, in line with Basel III requirements and, in particular for big international banks, quite comparable to capital 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  strengthening in US banks (when differences in accounting standards are neutralised). The banks have reimbursed half of the liquidity injected via the two LTRO programmes. 4. The Eurosystem From the very first signs of the crisis (remember the Eurosystem injected 90 billion euros in August 2007 to counter the impact of the first freeze in the financial markets), the Eurosystem has provided constant support to bank funding (and thereby underpinning credit to the economy). We have been able to use our collateral framework – with a wide range of counterparties accepted – to relieve the liquidity constraints faced by banks. The maximum maturity of our operations has increased from three months before the crisis to three years. Through these measures, we have addressed the liquidity pressures on banks and avoided a genuine credit crunch. Both our standard and non-standard monetary policies have prevented the materialisation of deflation risk. The programme we launched a year ago – Outright Monetary Transactions – succeeded in countering speculation about a euro area break-up. Its basic functioning is as follows: if a given State suffers unwarranted tensions on its debt, we could decide to intervene as far as is necessary, provided that State commits to an agreed recovery programme. Undoubtedly, the announcement of the creation of the OMTs had a very strong impact: banks and firms regained access to capital markets; the spreads between the yields on Spanish and German 10-year bonds fell from more than 6pp in July 2012 to just under 3pp in May 2013, while the premium on Italian 10-year bond halved. This new monetary policy instrument has therefore fostered a considerable improvement in financial conditions in the euro area and represents a solid shield against further speculative attacks. The ECB’s Governing Council has stressed that monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. In the period ahead, we will monitor very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and stand ready to act if necessary. ********* The euro area is getting stronger: it is undergoing major reforms, building new institutions and setting up powerful crisis management instruments. These major and in many respects historical advances will lay the foundations for the future of our monetary union. The effects on financial markets are already very visible: tensions have abated and signs of defragmentation are starting to appear (TARGET balances for instance have declined by almost 300 billion euros or 25% from their peak). We must now pursue the efforts already initiated and do our utmost to ensure that these improvements feed through to the real economy so that economic growth can return and unemployment can reverse its rising trend. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Dimitar Bogov: Impact of international regulatory cooperation on the Republic of Macedonia Opening speech by Mr Dimitar Bogov, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, at the 36th meeting of the European Banking Federation, Skopje, 7 June 2013. *      *      * Distinguished participants to the 36th European Banking Federation Associates’ Meeting, Dear Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me wish you a very warm welcome at today’s meeting. The topic I want to dedicate my welcoming speech on is international regulatory cooperation. The banking system in the Republic of Macedonia is predominantly foreign-owned and consists mostly of either subsidiaries of foreign banks or of banks owned by foreign portfolio investors. Foreign ownership has assisted banks in their efforts to follow sound market practice, develop and maintain high credit standards and receive encouragement and advice from their larger and longer established parent institutions. The global financial crisis and Eurozone debt crisis have not fundamentally changed this relationship. Nevertheless, these exceptional crises do constitute a real challenge for international and global banking. The Vienna Initiative, the framework to safeguard the financial stability of emerging Europe, has been valuable in raising awareness that the deleveraging process in developed Europe should not unduly restrict operations of bank subsidiaries in emerging Europe. In this context, it is important to note that even before the crises stroke, deposits raised in the Macedonian banking system by the predominantly foreign-owned domestic banks were lent by those same banks to borrowers in the Republic of Macedonia. As a rule, foreign funding, excluding equity and reserves, did not exceed 10% of all sources of financing of the banking sector. There has always been a difference amongst individual banks, a reflection of the different strategies for funding and acquiring sources, yet the overall importance of foreign funding is not in its percentage, but in its long-term nature. This is the premise on which the good business relations between parent banks and subsidiaries is based. When the crises stroke the relative importance of domestic deposits in financing the claims on Macedonian borrowers actually increased. In the Republic of Macedonia the ratio of loans to domestic GDP is still 47–50%, while the ratio of deposits to domestic GDP is around 55%. These ratios in the developed world tend to be above 100%, which shows the potential for growth. Similarly, the ratio of household debt, including mortgages, to household disposable income, is around 25%, substantially lower than most countries at a similar level of development, also offering opportunities for the banking sector. Regulatory capital allocation, on average, is 17%, more than two times the legal minimum of 8%. The high capitalisation of banks means they have the capacity to take losses and do not need to evergreen existing loans, but lend to new customers that are more likely to borrow. Strong capital ratios are one of the bright spots of the Macedonian economy. The Macedonian banking sector comprises 16 banks. This is still a somewhat high number, given the country’s population, and above all, the similarity of products banks are offering. Further mergers and acquisitions may have a positive impact on cost management, which will in turn make it easier for economies of scale to be achieved. On the other hand, domestic mergers and acquisitions are unlikely to involve a cutback in foreign ownership. Enhanced cooperation amongst regulators and supervisors from home and host supervisors is thus essential to the continuing stability of the system. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Yet there exists no precise definition what international regulatory cooperation is. Most of the time, it brings to mind the system of committees and working groups meeting in Basel, at the Bank for International Settlements. The international regulations which are the outcome of the Basel system, comprise among other documents, Basel III, the bold new guidelines at the core of which is the concept of risk-weight; some assets are riskier than others and this should be reflected in the percentage of capital that should be held against them. For credit risk, this riskiness is taken to depend on the obligor, i.e. it is taken that savers and investors are almost inherently more averse to obligations of some entities than to obligations of other entities. This approach is not new, but an enhancement of the existing Basel I and Basel II infrastructure. Most of the criticism directed at Basel III is that higher capital ratios will have an adverse impact on lending because of the high opportunity cost of holding capital. In the economies of emerging Europe, including South East Europe, this criticism is heard less often, given that foreign ownership implies that decisions on capital increases are made at the group or parent level. More generally, the proposition that an increase in capital leads to a reduction in lending is often not validated by the facts. The cost of bank equity, the compensation an investor requires for a bank, falls as the bank’s safety and soundness improve. As equity investors are last in the priority structure in case of a possible bankruptcy, higher capital allocation is likely to increase the confidence in the whole banking sector, which is also an aim of the Basel system. To conclude, the Basel III document is an important milestone in development of international financial regulation. It has both a regulatory and constitutive dimension: on the one hand, it operates as a further development requiring central banks and other regulators to behave in accordance with its principles in order to strengthen financial stability; on the other hand it establishes even firmer the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision as the pivot of international regulatory cooperation centred on the concept of risk-weight. But Basel III also invites the question of a perhaps different representation of entities taking part in its consultative phases. In this context, it is a logical next step that supervisory colleges encompassing home and host central banks and regulators from this region cooperate in having a greater input in the Basel Committee’s deliberations. Not only will this make everyone more aware of the variety of banking practices that exist in this region, but in conferring together at a senior level, during and between college meetings, central bankers and supervisors will secure a reasonable agreement between all parties as the best course on Basel III implementation. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia continues to be committed to the adoption of the principles and frameworks contained in the Basel guidance papers. In adopting this commitment we take care that implementation is adjusted to our circumstances. In order for individual rules not to harm the bank business in hand specifically, and the economy in general, overall regulation should allow the wise exercise of judgement or discretion by the banks applying it and by the regulator overseeing that application. I wish you, the European Banking Federation Associates’, a successful Meeting today and a pleasant stay in the Republic of Macedonia.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Muhammad bin Ibrahim: Catalysing SME growth Speech by Mr Muhammad bin Ibrahim, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Official Book Launch of “Catalysing SME growth”, organised by Credit Guarantee Corporation Malaysia Berhad (CGC), Kuala Lumpur, 21 June 2013. *      *      * Saya ingin mengucapkan tahniah kepada CGC atas pelancaran buku “Catalysing SME Growth”, sempena menyambut ulangtahun yang ke-40, yang merakam sejarah CGC dalam menyokong institusi kewangan di Malaysia bagi mambantu menyediakan pembiayaan kewangan untuk perusahaan kecil dan sederhana. CGC sebagai satu institusi, terus kekal kukuh dan teguh serta mempunyai pengetahuan yang dalam mengenai teras perniagaannya setelah melalui pelbagai kitaran perniagaan dan ekonomi sepanjang 4 dekad. Izinkan saya meneruskan ucapan saya dalam bahasa Inggeris. The Malaysian economy has undergone many changes in terms of both size and sectoral composition since CGC’s establishment in 1972. From being an agricultural-based economy with a GDP per capita of RM1,5981, Malaysia has become a more industrialised and service-oriented economy with a GDP per capita of RM32,124 as at end-2012.1 This remarkable story of growth is supported by the expansion of financing to the private sector by the financial system. In 1973, outstanding loans by commercial banks in Malaysia stood at RM5.5 billion. As at 30 April 2013, total outstanding loans by commercial banks increased to RM1,138.6 billion2 with annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.6% since 1973. The outstanding amount of SME financing stood at RM184.5 billion (16.2%). Relative to large companies, SMEs were traditionally considered riskier, as SMEs tend to have fewer assets that can be offered as collateral, lack of sufficient credit history and regarded as unbankable for some. CGC was established to address these concerns, by providing guarantees that enable SMEs to have expanded access to loans offered by financial institutions. Thus far, CGC has done a commendable job, providing guarantees to more than 420,000 companies, representing about 65% of the total SMEs, with total loans approved of more than RM51 billion as at end of 2012. SMEs are an important agent of growth and a component to support the nation’s aspiration to transform into high income and a high value-added economy. As a group, SMEs is a formidable force in the economy, as it forms 97.3% of established businesses and provides employment to 57.3% of the nation’s workforce. This contribution was recognised in the SME Master Plan where the growth by SMEs to the GDP is targeted to increase from 32.5% currently, to 41% by 2020. As the economy grows and becomes more sophisticated, so does the needs and requirements by the SMEs. In this regards, CGC has shown its ability to constantly reinvent itself to meet the needs of both the SMEs and financial institutions over the last 40 years. Looking at the list of CGC schemes throughout the years, the development of CGC’s products had mirrored the development of the country and the increased sophistication of the economy. From the book, we can see a long list of CGC schemes introduced throughout the years, each reflecting the stage of development of the country then, and also consistent with the strategy of the country’s economic policies. From CGC’s earliest products such as the                                                 1 Keluaran dalam Negeri Kasardan Pendapatan Negara Kasar pada Harga Semasa dan Harga Malar, Economic Planning Unit (EPU) statistics 2 Bank Negara Malaysia data

CGC’s achievements would not have been possible without the support of the financial institutions. The successes of CGC’s guarantee schemes were the result of the trust and collaboration between the corporation and the participating financial institutions. It is for this reason that over the years many achievements have materialised. CGC has achieved a lot of success it can be proud of, but as with life, we must move forward. Change is constant it becomes more rapid. There are a few things that we could do for the SMEs. First, we can lower the financing cost for SMEs which obtain guaranteed financing under CGC. On the average, SMEs are being charged between 10 to 12 percent. This is about BLR plus 5 to 6 percent. The rate imposed is much too high. It seems that pricing mechanism doesn’t price properly the guarantees given by CGC. We ought to work on this. On the part of CGC, we need to response quickly to the banks when guarantees are being called upon. An ideal situation is akin to an irrevocable undertaking where once a guarantee is called upon, it will be made good immediately. Second, to intensify promotion and awareness program on CGC products and services. CGC needs to work closely with the trade associations and generate more media exposures through radios and TVs. Make CGC a household name among the SMEs. Third, expand further advisory services, its reach and contents. Not all SMEs require financing, some might need more “hand holding”, and rather than access to financing above. Lastly, come up with new and specific guarantee products for new growth area, start-ups and young entrepreneurs. Existing guarantee products might not be suitable to meet the needs of these groups. CGC should embark a study on this matter and come up with an action plan. Before I end my speech, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations and appreciation to the Board, Management and staff of CGC for 40 years of service to the Malaysian SMEs. It is our greatest wish that CGC will continue to walk and grow alongside our SMEs in our effort to make our country prosperous.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Choongsoo Kim: Bank of Korea’s 63rd anniversary Speech by Dr Choongsoo Kim, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the commemorating ceremony of the Bank of Korea’s 63rd anniversary, Bank of Korea, Seoul, 14 June 2013. *      *      * Dear fellow members of the Bank of Korea, We come together to commemorate the anniversary of the Bank of Korea’s establishment each year, wherever we work – in Seoul, and in our domestic branches and overseas representative offices. By honoring the history and tradition established by those who served before us, and by reflecting on what our contributions are to the development of our national economy and of the Bank of Korea, and on what kind of legacy we will leave to those who come after us, we use this as an opportunity to look back on the past, to analyze the present, and to seek future directions. It was on this occasion back in 2010, when we celebrated our 60th anniversary and started out on a new sixty-year cycle, that we pledged to ourselves to make the BOK ‘a leading advanced central bank’ under the banner of a “global BOK”. This declared our resolve to develop ourselves to fully qualify as members of a leading world-class organization and to reform the Bank of Korea with strong resolve so that, reborn as a leading central bank, the BOK can play a vital role in steering the course of the Korean economy’s development. And three years have now passed already since we began our bank’s second sixty-year cycle with this solemn declaration before the nation and the world.  Although countries around the world have over the past five years struggled to emerge from the Great Recession, which is seen as the worst period of economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, their efforts have until now not borne sufficient fruit. On the one hand countries have tried various new and unprecedented macroeconomic policies, in order to overcome the crisis as quickly as possible and to achieve economic recovery. And on the other hand they have devoted utmost efforts to pursuing global financial regulatory reforms, to forestall a future crisis and prevent crisis from recurring. And the Korean economy is no exception to this trend of change, and is facing a variety of challenges and tasks in line with the changes in environment at home and abroad. This situation can be comparable to the adventure of exploring an unspoiled and unknown world, and the effectiveness of our knowledge and experience are being tested. In the past, of course, the future was always uncertain, but once the uncertainties had lifted we were able to enter into a new economic paradigm. What kind of economic paradigm will take shape before us once we overcome the serious uncertainties we are presently experiencing? What kind of new lessons will our recent ordeals have for us? I believe that the time is not far off when we will be able to look back on our current situation as one which we have been able to overcome wisely, and that it is our responsibility to bring this time forward. Admittedly we were unable to prevent the crisis erupting, but its outcome will be largely decided by our skill in tackling it. As is the way of the world, we must have the wisdom to turn current misfortune to our advantage.  In today’s global economy, where all economies are mutually interlinked, efforts on the part of just a few countries to solve global problems can hardly meet with success. Considering the analysis that the high degree of economic interconnectedness together with procyclical policy have increased systemic risks to the economy, and that this was a decisive factor behind the current global financial crisis, it is obvious that the involvement of many countries, and not just a few, is essential to overcoming it. Although the participation of a large number of countries will of course involve the problem of a complicated decision-making process, I do not believe there can be any objection to the view that global problems can only be solved by securing effective momentum toward their solutions through a system of international cooperation. What is important to us now is that, through our active involvement in the international decision-making process, we must express our positions and views and strive to articulate our visions so as to nudge the world economy onto the course of global economic development that we wish. Indeed, we should involve ourselves actively in the clear 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches awareness that this path coincides with the maximization of our national interests. If we are unable to take part in the international decision-making process, not only will we be unable to secure the reflection of our positions but we will also face the difficulty of not being able to obtain information enabling our timely adoption of appropriate policy responses. Today, in commemorating the 63rd anniversary of the Bank of Korea, I would like to share with you three tasks – related, specifically, to policies for tackling the global financial crisis and the trends of change in the international economic environment, to redefining the role of the BOK in line with the changes in economic conditions at home and abroad, and to the cultivation of the BOK’s and its staff’s potential. Dear friends and colleagues, We are paying more attention than ever before to the possibility of policy normalizations in the major advanced economies that implemented quantitative easing policies over the past few years, and to the influences that this will have on the international financial markets and emerging market economies. Needless to say, normalization does not necessarily mean a return to the pre-crisis state. It does, however, comprehensively involve the process of resolving matters such as when advanced economies will end their uses of unconventional tools, how the effects on other countries of their policy normalizations will develop, whether normalization will take place in an orderly manner through appropriate international policy cooperation, and what will be the economic vision in the post-crisis era. And none of these issues are unrelated to the Korean economy. The financial crisis that originated on Wall Street, and the consequent international financial reform efforts including Basel III; the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis caused by spread of the global financial crisis, and the continued unrest in the international financial markets; the fiscal problems in the U.S. including the sequester, and the uncertainties surrounding their resolutions; the unprecedented policy tools, each mobilized for a particular purpose, including Japan’s qualitative and quantitative easing(QQE) which have completely changed the basic framework of monetary policy – none of these are by any means easy to analyze, either separately or comprehensively. Some common characteristics of the countries implementing these policies, however, are that their policy rates are close to their zero lower bounds, and that their currencies are key currencies used in international settlement. Monetary policy is in principle conducted through taking into account the domestic economic situation, but key currency countries should understand that their monetary policies inevitably have international spillover effects. If a key currency country overlooks such externalities this can be interpreted as a dereliction of its responsibility to maintain the stability of the international economic order, and its currency may face the risk of possibly losing its credibility as a reserve currency in international community. For countries like Korea, meanwhile, whose currencies are not key currencies and have not yet been sufficiently internationalized, measures for responding to policies such as the quantitative easing by key currency countries cannot be found in economic textbooks written in the past. A new task for us, therefore, is to find alternative measures appropriate to our domestic circumstances by ourselves, through our own research. Under the assumption of the relative values of currencies being maintained, empirically identifying the effective lower bound of our policy rate, corresponding to the zero lower bounds of the key currency countries, is another homework assignment that we must solve. In an environment in which the magnitudes of change are increasing as globalization spreads more widely than ever before, these are newly emerging policy tasks that we must work proactively to find solutions for. It may sound a bit ironic, but we should always bear in mind that, although one of the causes of the current financial crisis was the further strengthening of interconnectedness among economies due to the rapid progress made in globalization, the process of overcoming this crisis will in its consequences also further strengthen globalization. Discussions of quantitative easing termination and exit strategies are likely to be at the tops of the agendas in advanced economies in the near future, and reviews of action plans for the normalization process are being carried out. Needless to say, the extent of the impacts of the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 normalization process on the world economy will depend upon whether advanced central banks have the capacities to manage market expectations appropriately so that the markets can refrain from overreacting. The importance of communication with the markets thus becomes emphasized still further. Although the pace of economic recovery is understood as a key to determining the timing of a change in monetary policy stance, the fact that the cost of sustaining quantitative easing may become ever larger over time, relative to its benefits, is also working as a factor moving forward the times of changes in policy stances. There is in addition the unavoidable reality that the marginal utility involved has been gradually diminishing as several countries have come to undertake quantitative easing. There are several issues before us in this regard that we must focus on and address. First, there is the question of whether the normalization will take place in a synchronized or in a sequenced fashion. The former is not all that likely, as the circumstances of the individual advanced economies concerned vary, but if synchronized normalization does actually happen its influence is likely to be enormous. And even in the case of the latter method of normalization, the occurrence of increased capital flow and exchange rate volatility will persist for an extended period, meaning that we can most emphatically not say that its costs will be low. Since the range of fluctuation will depend upon the relative influences of the effects of various policies and systems, we will need to maintain a timely watch on changes in the international financial markets and adopt a flexible stance when responding so as to prevent any excessive volatilities of capital flows or exchange rates. The process of sequenced normalization will meanwhile be sequenced not only across countries, but also across the various different policy tools introduced in each country Second, the process of normalization will entail rises in interest rates, and we can therefore not rule out the possibility of facing the risk of a global interest rate increase. We need to also pay attention to the increased burdens on the financial sector for maintaining soundness, such as the demand for raising of additional capital due to potential valuation losses on bond holdings. From a historical perspective, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in the mid-1990s caused long-term Treasury bond rates to rise significantly, and due to the consequent drastic capital outflows Latin American countries experienced a series of financial crises. In contrast, the Fed’s interest rate hikes in the late-1990s did not trigger any increase in long-term bond rates, and in the mid-2000s, despite rate hikes by the Fed long-term yields on government bonds even fell, triggering a phenomenon referred to as “Greenspan’s conundrum”. Bearing in mind that the results of a policy rate hike may therefore vary significantly, we must keep a close eye on market changes. We should note that while the economic crises in many countries during periods of interest rate increases over the past few decades can be traced in part to common phenomena such as rises in funding costs and declines in asset prices, they have also been attributable to large extents to financial institutions’ adverse selection. And this is because the adverse side effects and economic vulnerabilities built up through the widespread pursuit of high-risk, high-return investment during periods of low interest rates become evident once rates begin to rise. Third, we should work internally to identify the effects of our various policy instruments, and make preparations for dealing with any changes in external conditions promptly while at the same time devoting active efforts to eliciting global cooperation. The ratios of exports to GDP stand at only around 10 and 13 percent respectively in the U.S. and Japan, but in Korea reaches nearly 50 percent. We should note that stability in the international economic environment achieved through global cooperation is all the more important for the Korean economy, whose growth is so heavily dependent upon external conditions. Meanwhile, since it is a global rather than a regional equilibrium that must be achieved in order to maintain global economic growth and stability, we need to redouble our efforts to promote global cooperation so as to create an environment that is favorable to us. My dear friends and colleagues at the Bank of Korea, The revision of the Bank of Korea Act at the end of 1997 gave us a single responsibility, for price stability, and to achieve this goal we have operated an inflation targeting regime. With 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches the 2011 revision of the Act we have now assumed partial responsibility for financial stability as well, but are all well aware that this can be achieved only through cooperation among the government, the supervisory authorities and the central bank. In light of this, we need to closely examine the cases of the U.S., which operates, as its organization in charge of financial stability a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), consisting of the Treasury Department, the nation’s supervisory organizations and the Fed, and of other countries. All over the world today, central banks are increasingly being asked to participate in the efforts to promote economic growth and prevent future crisis through more active and diverse means. Although based on the premise that it is within the central bank’s legal responsibilities, the fact that ECB President Mario Draghi's promise last July to do “whatever it takes to preserve the euro” has been the most frequently mentioned and most strongly supported policy intention since then is direct proof of this. Mr. Draghi’s words show us how the central bank’s standing and roles are rapidly changing in directions different from in the past. And in fact the roles of the Bank of Korea are also expanding in various ways, in line with changes in our internal and external environments. I would like now to consider the current tasks that we face, by dividing them into four areas:  First, and above all, maintaining price stability is our responsibility stipulated in Article 1 of the Bank of Korea Act. We have set the medium-term inflation target range at from 2.5 to 3.5 percent for the next three years beginning from 2013, and are operating monetary policy accordingly. It is the central bank’s primary goal to stabilize and ensure that the medium- to long-term inflation expectations of economic agents converge to the inflation target, but since we use CPI as an inflation indicator, which has a decisive influence on inflation expectations, it is also very important that we manage changes in the CPI appropriately. One of the characteristics of the structure determining inflation in Korea is that price determinants on the supply side, such as oil and vegetable prices, have greater influences than they do in other countries. And the stability of these prices has kept inflation below the lower bound of the target range for the past few months. Since economic agents’ inflation expectations remain at around the 3 percent level, however, there still exists an inflationary bias. Moreover, when we look at the international discussions we see two extremes of arguments. Some on the one hand say, considering the sustained low inflation in many countries since the crisis, that inflation concerns have now vanished and we should prepare ourselves instead for the risk of deflation resulting from the hoarding of liquidity. As an aftereffect of the excess liquidity supplied by advanced countries’ quantitative easing policies, in contrast, others expect inflation to be unavoidable in the future. And since the Korean economy is very sensitive to changes in external conditions, we, as the nation’s central bank, must be prepared to cope with whatever future course the global economy takes.  Second, maintaining financial stability has become one of the major responsibilities of the Bank of Korea, as since the 2011 revision of the Bank of Korea Act we have begun placing greater emphasis on macroprudential issues than before in our joint inspections of financial institutions, and have gained increased access to data from financial institutions. We have also successfully constructed an econometric model for systemic risk assessment, and are working now on improvement of our Financial Stability Report, a statutory report submitted biannually to the National Assembly, so that it can be recognized at the global level. While in the process of overcoming the global financial crisis advanced countries have been managing their own economies in exceptionally low interest rate environments, we must bear in mind the comment that, in such an environment, the possibility should never be overlooked of the accumulation of economic vulnerabilities. The possibility of funds flowing continuously to businesses subject to restructuring can also not be ruled out, and the vulnerabilities of these businesses will become immediately apparent if there is any hike in global interest rates. We must continuously monitor the markets to pick up imperceptible signs of a crisis, closely analyze the data to identify any possibilities of tail risk, and develop capabilities to maintain financial stability. We must also redouble our efforts to ensure that we are not overlooking any tail risks, by closely examining whether the probability distribution that we rely on excessively truncates specific parts of the upper and the lower areas, or 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 whether the distribution does not represent the entire population of the economy due to any kind of selection bias. Third, the expanded application of credit policy is a task that the Bank of Korea must also focus on going forward. Despite central banks around the world having adopted accommodative monetary policy stances and provided sufficient liquidity to the markets, this liquidity has not been linking with the real economy, and this fact has been pointed out as the main cause for countries around the world being unable to properly achieve growth. To overcome this, central banks are, through commercial banks, attempting to strengthen their roles in providing funds to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with the potentials to contribute to economic growth. The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) for SMEs is cited as a good policy example, and the ECB is also considering measures to support SMEs. With the recent introduction of the Supporting Program for High Quality Technology Start-up SMEs, we at the Bank of Korea have also enlarged and reformed our Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loan system dramatically, seeking to contribute to enhancing the nation’s growth potential by improving SMEs’ productivity. Such policies and financial inclusion policies had previously been considered as falling within the government’s brief, but are gradually coming to be considered now to lie within the domain of the central bank. Central banks are endeavoring to play more active roles in the efforts to strengthen the real and financial sector linkages. And by heightening the role of credit policy in complementing monetary policy, we are trying to redefine the expression “monetary and credit policies” specified in Article 1 of the Bank of Korea Act to conform with circumstances of our era. Fourth, we must redouble our efforts to build up our networking with leading central banks. To ensure global economic growth and stability, we cannot stress too much the importance of the sharing of information among economies and their collaboration and cooperation in policy. The Bank of Korea has, by utilizing the proceeds of the won-yuan swap agreement between the Bank of Korea and the People’s Bank of China, initiated use of the domestic currencies in trade settlement from early this year. Although we are still in an initial stage of striving to organize and foster the related systems, we can say that we have taken the first step, albeit cautiously, toward internationalization of the Korean won, and that there may ultimately be a need to examine measures for expanding this effort to all economies with which Korea has concluded FTAs. In order to support economic exchanges involving Islamic banking, an area in which economic cooperation is expected to increase in the future, we signed an MOU with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates last week. Going forward we also plan to sign MOUs with central banks in South America, and we would like to meaningfully expand our personnel and resource exchanges with the various central banks that have signed exchange agreements with the Bank of Korea. To my mind, it is only when all of these various efforts bear fruit that a ‘Global BOK’ will truly be established.  Dear members of the Bank of Korea, If the various wide range of new operations that we have discussed so far is limited to the purview of only a small number of departments, then we can never achieve the sought-after results. Their effects can only be realized when all departments of the Bank of Korea, including our domestic branches and our overseas representative offices, hold them as common goals and put them into practice. I would like to make it clear that no one among the 2,200 staff members of the Bank of Korea is unconnected with these activities. I emphasize this because the operation of our organization must not be rigid, and we can come up with effective alternatives as needed only when we have established a climate of flexible mutual cooperation. If globalization refers to the disappearance of borders between countries, then we can only truly find ways of responding to globalization within our organization when the borders between our departments disappear. The mission given to us is to be able to nurture individuals who are in tune with these changes in our environment, meaning those whose ways of thinking and behavior are globalized. It is in truth impossible to overemphasize the importance of a multi-disciplinary knowledge. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches It is my judgment that the education and training of our staff carried out over the past few years, to strengthen their potential capabilities, have come to great fruition. Increases in various kinds of publications written under our staff members’ names, as well as the spread in the writing of papers to staff from almost all departments are major features in this regard. For example, the numbers of entries in the BOK Staff Paper Competition were 23 in 2011 and 27 in 2012, and have increased substantially to 38 this year. The numbers of contest participants have also increased during these years – from 38 to 44 and then 56. Another visible change, moreover, is that among these participants there have been eight lead, principal or senior economists. The number of our staff participating in international conferences has meanwhile also increased greatly, from 351 in 2010 to 412 in 2011 and 457 in 2012. Classified by rank, among all of these people in 2012 there were 141 economists, 103 senior economists and 77 principal economists, with marked increases being seen among senior economists and economists. I promoted the participation of lower-ranking staff in working-level conferences in the belief that their experiences there would enable them to play proper roles when they participated in conferences as higher-ranking officials in the future. I believe that this is now starting to show the desired results, and am convinced that the continuation of this trend will lead to a bright future for our Bank.  An even more significant change can be identified by looking at the numbers of joint research projects carried out by our headquarters and domestic branches. These numbers were one in 2010, 35 in 2011 and 64 in 2012. Among them, the number of projects conducted jointly with foreign institutions has exhibited a dramatic change – from zero in 2012 to four in 2011 and 20 in 2012. And even though the first half of this year has not yet passed, there are already 20 such projects currently under way. The number of joint research projects carried out at the domestic branch level was one in 2010, but these projects have also became active recently, increasing to 15 in 2011 and 17 in 2012. In the meantime, collaborative joint research among our domestic branches has begun from this year, and in next month the general managers of all domestic branches and director generals of our headquarters departments plan to meet to discuss three joint research projects among domestic branches. From the next quarter we also plan to release a “BOK Quarterly Regional Economic Report”, in which all domestic branches will take part. We expect to see in this the birth of a Korean “Beige Book, utilized as useful information on our nation’s regional economies. The majority of studies conducted by our domestic branches have meanwhile been recommendations in the studies have been adopted in policy-making by the local governments concerned.  Since their introductions in 2011, the numbers of staff who have participated in job training have been 286 in our Global Initiative Program (GIP) and 144 in our intensive training program for principal and senior economists. There have also been 83 staff from foreign central banks who have participated in the GIP, helping to establish networks between their banks and the Bank of Korea, and the number of foreign central bank applicants for the program has been on the rise. Every year we also have around 10 BOK staff members taking part in the training programs of international institutions and foreign central banks.  In sum, I think that staff with great potential are provided with opportunities to display their potential freely, and that we have seen positive results from this. Intangible assets, which are necessary in order for the Bank of Korea to become a leading advanced central bank, are being accumulated almost without our noticing it. I believe these are proud and inspiring achievements, that have produced considerable changes in a short period of time.  Dear fellow BOK members, At international meetings I have often raised the new issue that an era of central bank competition is on the horizon. I believe that this is a natural outcome of the increased impacts of central banks on their national economies in line with the changes characteristic of our times. Although there were opinions raised at first that the concept of competition applied to central banks seemed somewhat awkward, since the central bank is the only such institution in its country, this is in fact a valid concept since there are a number of different central banks in the global economy as a whole. And as I have stressed to you at every opportunity, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 the Bank of Korea’s contribution to Korean economic development must not be smaller than those made by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the People’s Bank of China to their own respective economies.  By now we should have the capabilities to comprehend other central banks’ activities, and to establish and implement policies tailored to our own national economic conditions as well. Performing such varied functions could be compared to facing a situation in which we sometimes need to aim at a moving target. And in this environment, it cannot be said that we are performing an appropriate role if we simply follow theories or practices established under other economic conditions. We should instead be developing our abilities to create alternatives befitting our own national economy. Fostering the potential to understand what has gone wrong is just as important as the effort to find the answer to a problem. We are living in an era in which people equipped with critical minds and the capacities to uncover new tasks are urgently needed.  If we consider our future by putting together the things I have just said, the global financial crisis facing us now will be ultimately overcome by strengthening the dynamic characteristics of our economy and by eliminating its uncertainties. It should be borne in mind that this crisis was not just a temporary one, and that a new steady-state equilibrium might have been created as the crisis has become prolonged. Low interest rates may have already become entrenched in our economy, for instance, and breaking from them to achieve normalization could carry other costs. To achieve economic recovery to normalcy and thus escape crisis, animal spirits must serve as a catalyst for our economy’s dynamic growth, while at the same time its productivity must be enhanced through constant restructuring. In order to contribute to national economic development by encouraging these economic conditions, the Bank of Korea should carry out the four roles that I have discussed above more faithfully. On the macroeconomic policy side, the Bank must support growth until our national economy has recovered to the level of its potential growth, while from the microeconomic policy perspective maintaining its accommodative monetary policy and devising means for financial facilitation to ensure that the productivity of SMEs can increase.  In this process, meanwhile, the importance of financial stability should not be downplayed. We must not forget that during the Great Moderation, in which we enjoyed stable inflation and appropriate growth for a long period of time, we failed to sense that the seeds of a crisis were being sown. We have so far been paying greater social and economic costs due to the uncertainties stemming from the crisis than we have yet realized. The rising corporate savings amid the crisis in most countries clearly indicate a lack of corporate investment due to uncertainty. And the resulting low growth is the price that we have been paying. Since there is a risk of mutual interaction between uncertainty and speculative activities, central banks have the responsibility to closely monitor market conditions in order to reduce the adverse effects caused by disruptive factors stemming from speculative capital.  Before concluding, I would like to say a few more words. Today we have been able to confirm together that there are incalculable challenges lying ahead of us. However, only an organization that confronts rather than shrinks from such challenges will thrive. It has become clear recently that our organization’s response capability has been greatly enhanced, and that our employees have been actively utilizing their potentials. Based upon this confidence, let us further cultivate our public servant spirits as central bankers, so as to further strengthen our Bank’s status as a central bank held in great respect by the public. We will need to develop ourselves so that our society becomes more interested in and more in demand of our talents. To this end, greater spirits of sacrifice and service should be the foundations of our lives. If we steadily move forward with consistency and a strong belief in our future, the Bank of Korea will be recognized for its contributions to the national economy. Perspiration, tears and pain are the fates of those who sow seeds. I look forward to seeing many such leaders emerging in our Bank.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  William C Dudley: Are recent college graduates finding good jobs? Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Chairman of the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), at the Regional Economic Press Briefing, New York City, 27 June 2013. *      *      * Good morning and welcome once again to the New York Fed’s Regional Economic Press Briefing. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region – and through you to the people in our District. This morning I will briefly discuss conditions in the national economy and then focus on regional economic conditions, with particular attention to the question of whether recent college graduates are finding good jobs. We will examine the trends and see how they are playing out in the region.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.  National economic conditions  I would like to begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment. Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014. Since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009, we have had 15 consecutive quarters of positive growth of real GDP. However, the average annual growth rate over that period has been just 2.1 percent. Although the unemployment rate has declined by 2.5 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, much of this decline is due to the fact that the labor force participation rate has fallen by 1.5 percentage points over this period. Recall that discouraged workers who do not actively look for work are regarded as not participating in the labor force and so are not counted as unemployed even though they are without jobs. Using an alternative measure, the employment to population ratio, which is not influenced by changes in the number of discouraged workers, there has been limited improvement in labor market conditions. Job loss rates have fallen, but hiring rates remain depressed at low levels. Taken together, the labor market still cannot be regarded as healthy. Numerous indicators, including the behavior of labor compensation and household assessments of labor market conditions, are all consistent with the view that there remains a great deal of slack in the economy. That being said, I see persuasive evidence of improved underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy. Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now at the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade. Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining liabilities. Banks are beginning to ease credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightness. As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods. For example, light-weight motor vehicles sold at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 15.3 million in May, not far from the 16.1 million sales in 2007.  Similarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade. Housing starts and sales are now on a clear upward trend, and a widely followed national home price index is up around 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  12 percent over the twelve months ending in April.1 Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a lack of homes for sale. Unfortunately, the improvements in consumer spending on durable goods and housing are not yet showing through in the overall GDP growth rate due to the significant headwinds that we continue to face. First, federal fiscal policy has recently become quite contractionary. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that this fiscal restraint is on the order of 1.75 percentage points of potential GDP this year. In the period since 1960, there have been only two previous episodes of fiscal contraction of this order of magnitude – 1969 and 1987 – both of which occurred when the economy was on a more solid footing than it is today. Second, the euro area is experiencing a protracted recession and growth in many of the largest emerging economies has slowed. This has resulted in a very sharp slowing of U.S. exports, with an associated slowing in production and employment growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Thus, I continue to see the economy as being in a tug-of-war between fiscal drag and underlying fundamental improvement, with a great deal of uncertainty over which force will prevail in the near-term. This tug-of-war is clearly seen in the monthly employment data. Over April and May, the average monthly gain in employment in the private service-providing sector has been well maintained at 175,000. In contrast, employment in the manufacturing sector and the federal government declined a combined 20,000 per month. And the resulting uncertainty is, I believe, an important contributing factor behind the relatively sluggish pace of business investment spending. My best guess is that growth for all of 2013, measured on a Q4/Q4 basis, will be about what it has been since the end of the recession. But I believe a strong case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up notably in 2014. The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag will begin to subside. I also see some indications that growth prospects among our major trading partners have begun to improve; for example, the rise in the June euro area composite Purchasing Managers’ Index. And this combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will gather strength. Finally, I believe this tug-of-war analogy is useful in explaining the recent inflation dynamics. As is well known, total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has slowed sharply over the past year and is now running below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent. Much of the slowing of total inflation is due to declining energy prices resulting from the weakening of global growth mentioned earlier combined with increased energy production here in the U.S. However, it is also the case that core inflation, that is, excluding food and energy, has slowed sharply as well. A decomposition of the slowing in core inflation reveals that some of it is due to slowing in the rate of increase in prices of non-food and non-energy goods. This probably is due in large part to the softening of global demand for goods and the modest appreciation of the dollar that has occurred since mid-2011.  In the service sector, the rate of increase in prices of medical services and “non-market” services – the latter includes some financial services – also has slowed notably recently. In contrast, the rate of increase in prices for other non-energy services has been relatively stable. Comparing this set of conditions to that in 2010, the recent slowing of inflation has been less widespread across core goods and core services, and inflation expectations so far have declined less appreciably than they did in 2010. Thus, my best guess is that core goods prices will begin to firm in the months ahead as global demand begins to strengthen and inventories get into better alignment with sales.                                                  1  CoreLogic Report Shows Home Prices Rise by 12.1 Percent Year Over Year in April. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  As is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will be monitoring U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly in response to new information. At its meeting last week, the FOMC decided to continue its accommodative policy stance. It reaffirmed its expectation that the current low range for the federal funds rate target will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well-behaved. It is important to remember that these conditions are thresholds, not triggers. The FOMC also maintained its purchases of $40 billion per month in agency MBS and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities, with a stated goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in a context of price stability. In its statement, the FOMC said that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve. As Chairman Bernanke stated in his press conference following the FOMC meeting, if the economic data over the next year turn out to be broadly consistent with the outlooks that the FOMC sees as most likely, which are roughly similar to the outlook I have already laid out, the FOMC anticipates that it would be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchases later this year. Under such a scenario, subsequent reductions might occur in measured steps through the first half of next year, and an end to purchases around mid-2014. Under this scenario, at the time that asset purchases came to an end, the unemployment rate likely would be near 7 percent and the economy’s momentum strengthening, supporting further robust job gains in the future.  Here, a few points deserve emphasis. First, the FOMC’s policy depends on the progress we make towards our objectives. This means that the policy – including the pace of asset purchases – depends on the outlook rather than the calendar. The scenario I outlined above is only that – one possible outcome. Economic circumstances could diverge significantly from the FOMC’s expectations. If labor market conditions and the economy’s growth momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC’s outlook – and this is what has happened in recent years – I would expect that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for longer.  Second, even if this scenario were to occur and the pace of purchases were reduced, it would still be the case that as long as the FOMC continues its asset purchases it is adding monetary policy accommodation, not tightening monetary policy. As the FOMC adds to its stock of securities, this should continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, making monetary policy more accommodative.  Third, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep most of these assets on its balance sheet for a long time. As Chairman Bernanke noted in his press conference last week, a strong majority of FOMC participants no longer favor selling agency MBS securities during the monetary policy normalization process. This implies a bigger balance sheet for longer, which provides additional accommodation today and continuing support for mortgage markets going forward.  Fourth, even under this scenario, a rise in short-term rates is very likely to be a long way off. Not only will it likely take considerable time to reach the FOMC’s 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold, but also the FOMC could wait considerably longer before raising short-term rates. The fact that inflation is coming in well below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective is relevant here. Most FOMC participants currently do not expect short-term rates to begin to rise until 2015.  Some commentators have interpreted the recent shift in the market-implied path of short-term interest rates as indicating that market participants now expect the first increases in the federal funds rate target to come much earlier than previously thought. Setting aside whether this is the correct interpretation of recent price moves, let me emphasize that such an expectation would be quite out of sync with both FOMC statements and the expectations of most FOMC participants.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Regional economic conditions Let me turn now to the regional economy, the focus of our presentations today. Our last briefing on the regional economy took place at a difficult time – soon after Superstorm Sandy. While economic life has returned to normal across most of the metro area, some of the hardest-hit areas are still struggling to recover and rebuild. Just blocks from here, in fact, the South Street Seaport business district is still far from business-as-usual. And there are many such neighborhoods across the metropolitan region, from the low-lying and coastal areas of New Jersey to Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island; from Staten Island to southern Connecticut. One encouraging sign, though, is that our broader regional economy has shown remarkable resilience. It has been growing and adding jobs at a reasonably good pace. Moreover, the rebuilding effort appears to be giving a bit of a boost to the job market in industries such as construction.  As we’ve discussed before, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor the performance of New York State, New York City and New Jersey. Based on these measures, New York City has continued to grow strongly, and New Jersey’s economy has seen some pickup in growth since the beginning of this year. However, growth in New York State has slowed, and Puerto Rico’s economy is not faring well at all; the activity index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico shows that the Island’s economy has yet to show any signs of bottoming out.  The job situation has varied somewhat across our region. Improvement has generally been broad-based, with New York City and Long Island doing particularly well, though Puerto Rico continues to weaken. Both Connecticut and New Jersey have recently been growing roughly in line with the nation thus far in 2013. Unemployment rates across the region are roughly matching the national rate, with the exception of the relatively high rate that has characterized Puerto Rico’s labor market for some time. Housing continues to be a focus of our regional monitoring efforts and home prices in our region appear to have bottomed. Our economists will elaborate on these points this morning.  Are recent college graduates finding good jobs? The special topic of today’s press briefing is a look at how well recent college graduates are faring in the job market, both nationally and here in our region. A college education represents an important investment in one’s human capital, meaning the knowledge and skills people build. Historically, it’s been pretty clear that those who’ve invested in a college education have tended to earn a sizeable economic return. And the benefits of college-educated citizens go well beyond the individual. Regions with a higher concentration of college graduates tend to be more innovative, have higher living standards and experience more rapid economic growth.2 So a college education plays an important role in helping individuals prosper, as well as in strengthening the broader economy. More recently, though, rising costs, increasing student debt and widespread reports of recent college graduates not being able to find good jobs have raised some troubling questions about whether going to college is still a good investment. In fact, some of our own research, including material that we discussed at our last press briefing, has shown the dramatic increase in student debt over the past decade.3 In today’s briefing, we’re going to take a                                                 2  See, for example, Edward L.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  close look at the question of just how weak today’s labor market is for new college graduates by putting their recent experience into context using some hard data. It is important for us to undertake this kind of analysis because, as we’ll show, newly minted graduates always take some time to transition into the labor market and find jobs that utilize their education. And young people with college degrees still fare far better than those without. At the same time, with the sluggish jobs recovery from the recession, it’s clear that the transition of recent graduates into the labor market is taking longer, and they’ve experienced higher unemployment and higher underemployment than in years past.4 Still, while times have gotten tougher for recent graduates, we shouldn’t be too hasty in concluding that getting a college education won’t help people find good jobs.  I will now ask Jason Bram to present an update of economic conditions in our region.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jens Weidmann: Making the financial system more resilient Keynote speech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the 2013 FESE (Federation of European Securities Exchanges) Convention, Berlin, 27 June 2013. *      *      * 1.  Introduction President Jochumsen Ladies and gentlemen Thank you for having me here today at this year’s FESE Convention. It is the first time I have attended this event, although there are numerous points of contact between securities exchanges and central banks. Central banks and securities exchanges have in common that they provide the economy with an infrastructure which is essential for a well-functioning market economy. Exchanges provide functioning and regulated platforms for the trading of securities, and so contribute to an efficient allocation of capital and resources. Central banks maintain price stability, thereby among other things also contributing to allocation efficiency and laying the foundation for sustainable growth. Another important task of central banks is to smooth the operation of payment systems. The Eurosystem provides important infrastructure for the financial system, in particular TARGET2. By establishing TARGET2-Securities the Eurosystem will also provide a harmonised and centralised method of settling securities in central bank money in Europe that will improve settlement efficiency. 2.  The role of financial market regulation Some years ago, financial integration in Europe was considered a one-way street leading to greater wealth. This view has been challenged by the financial crisis, since it has shown the flip-side of financial integration in Europe, which is mutual contagion. In order to reap the benefits of financial integration without having the downside risk of contagion effects, micro-prudential regulation needs tightening and effective macro-prudential regulation has to be established. More generally, the crisis has also challenged the formerly wide-spread view that the outcome of financial deregulation is always good. Adair Turner, the former Chairman of the British FSA, self-critically confessed in a speech he gave at Cass Business School in 2010: “We were philosophically inclined to accept that if innovation created new markets and products that must be beneficial, and that if regulation stymied innovation that must be bad.” I definitely do not want to deny the merits of innovative, flexible financial markets. But with hindsight, I think it is also hard to deny that insufficient financial market regulation as well as inadequate oversight and supervision helped macroeconomic and financial imbalances to emerge or to intensify. Moreover, differences in the speed and scope of financial deregulation at the national or regional level led to regulatory arbitrage by financial market players. The pendulum has been swinging back since the onset of the financial crisis. When the leaders of the G20 pledged in November 2008 “to strengthen our regulatory regimes, prudential oversight, and risk management, and ensure that all financial markets, products and participants are regulated or subject to oversight”, this was the starting shot for a comprehensive global regulatory reform agenda. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Almost five years later, a great deal has been done. Many issues have been tackled and reforms have already been implemented. Yet a great deal still needs to be done and we have to maintain political interest in a stable financial system with appropriate regulation. The key objective of financial regulation should be to make the financial system more stable and therefore more resistant to shocks. On the other hand, regulation must maintain the financial system’s ability to fulfil its servicing role for the real economy appropriately. In this regard, I agree with Robert Shiller, who believes in the value added of the financial system. In his most recent book he writes: “Finance, despite its flaws and excesses, is a force that potentially can help us to create a better, more prosperous and more equitable society.” Hence, financial regulation is about addressing market failure and not about abolishing the market mechanism. 3.  Strengthening the principle of liability In order to achieve the key objective of a more stable and shock-resistant financial system, it is essential to strengthen the principle of individual responsibility and of liability. The principle of liability is one of the basic principles for the functioning of market economies, and it should clearly also apply to the financial system. Essentially, it says that those who have the benefit should also bear the costs. One of the root causes of the financial crisis is that, in the financial sector, the principle of liability was too weakly implemented. However, lacking liability creates incentives to take excessive risks. The problem of banks that are “too big to fail” may illustrate this. Ultimately, systemic importance infringes the principle of liability. Excessively risky transactions go unpunished because those who have the benefit do not bear the costs. The decisive question now is how the principle of liability could be strengthened by regulatory measures. • In the case of banks, higher capital requirements are the favourable and chosen way. They enable banks to shoulder greater losses by themselves, and thus shift the risk back to the owners. The implementation of Basel III – not only in Europe but hopefully in the United States, too – is therefore an important step towards making the financial system safer. In addition to the implementation of Basel III, I am convinced that it would make the banking sector less vulnerable and, thus, strengthen its liability if banks were required to hold sufficient capital for claims on sovereigns and not be allowed to accumulate them on too large a scale in future. • The principle of liability is also important with regard to the establishment of a European banking union, which is currently the subject of heated debate. The main task of the single resolution mechanism that is currently being developed is to ensure the correct sequence of liability. If a bank is to be restructured or resolved, equity investors should be called on first to take losses, followed by the providers of debt capital and only then by depositors, taking due account of deposit guarantees in the respective member states and national or European rescue funds. Taxpayers should only be called upon as a very last resort.  While joint liability implies joint control, the other way round is also true. However, even after the creation of a banking union, banks’ balance sheets also remain a mirror of national economic and legal developments. Changes in national insolvency law i.e. would have an impact on the burden possibly to be financed by European funds. Hence, the banking union needs far-reaching coordination and tighter joint regulation. Remaining room for manoeuvre in regulation at national level has to be considered when deciding on the distribution of the financial burden between the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  member states. Legacy risks, however, should not be related to the banking union. If it is actually decided to communitise legacy debts, this would be a financial transfer. Transparency for members of the general public and taxpayers then also requires that this transfer be disclosed as such. Of course, transfers are usually not reinforcing the liability principle. It goes without saying that strengthening the liability principle goes beyond bank regulation. Regulatory measures in other fields of the financial system have to make sure that non-bank financial entities become more liable and accountable, too. Let me give you two examples In future, credit rating agencies will be held liable in the event of intentional or grossly negligent violations of the respective European regulation. I appreciate this, but it is clear that it will be difficult to prove deliberate intent or gross negligence in practice. However, while making credit rating agencies more liable and accountable helps to improve the quality and integrity of credit ratings, it is not sufficient to ensure proper risk management in the financial system. In order to improve due diligence, it will also be required – as intended by the new EU regulation CRA III – to reduce the mechanistic reference to external credit ratings in financial market regulation, which has led to an overreliance on external ratings. Although external ratings will still have a role to play in financial markets, investors should become better able to conduct their own risk assessment, and so become more responsible for their investment decisions. After all, a rating is no substitute for thought. Another case that could be seen as an example of regulators’ commitment to increase the liability of all market participants is the reform of OTC derivatives markets. Much progress has already been made by requiring sufficient collateralisation for derivatives positions, especially when cleared centrally through central counterparties. In other words, market participants will be forced to bear further costs of their derivatives business in the near future. The clearing obligation will be complemented by a trading obligation for eligible OTC derivatives. Last week EU finance ministers agreed on a common position regarding a revision of MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) which will have a significant impact on European exchanges and other trading venues. The MiFID review will shift a significant share of OTC derivatives trading to exchanges or other regulated trading venues. Light will be shone on dark trading by trade transparency requirements, leading to more accountability for derivatives traders. 4.  Beware the risk of government failure The basic task of financial regulation is to cure market failure. The large number of regulatory work strands might create the impression that the, at times, exaggerated faith in the efficiency of the markets before the crisis is now being replaced by excessive faith in governments. The financial crisis, however, is not only the result of market failure. To some extent, it is also the result of government failure and undue regulation. Just think about how public incentives for home ownership helped housing bubbles in various countries to emerge or how the zero-risk weighting of sovereign bonds gave incentives to over-invest in sovereigns. Hence, regulators should refrain from substituting and fine-tuning markets and private agents. We should bear in mind what Walter Eucken, one of the founding fathers of German ordoliberalism, once wrote, namely that economic policy should aim at “the shaping of the forms of order of an economy” and “not the direction of economic process”. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Regulation is not an end in itself. The costs and benefits of the planned measures, including their side-effects and interactions, have to be weighed up. One example of this is the planned financial transaction tax. While a fundamental political consensus has been reached on the introduction of the tax in some countries of the EU, the unintended side-effects have to be considered carefully. In its originally envisaged form, the tax would also cover collateralised money market transactions, known as repo transactions. This would cause considerable harm to the repo market, which plays a key role in the redistribution of liquidity among commercial banks. However, hampering it would make banks more dependent on liquidity provision by central banks. 5.  Conclusion To sum up, over the past five years, substantial progress has been made in the regulation of the financial system. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency. There are still shortcomings in financial regulation to be eliminated. This notwithstanding, it is necessary to thoroughly assess the impact of the different reforms and measures. Ensuring that players in the financial system have to, and are able to, better bear losses and risks themselves in future will make the financial system more stable. Strengthening the principle of liability will help the financial system to serve the economy and society better. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jens Weidmann: Crisis economics – the crisis as a challenge for economists Lecture by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Annual Gala Meeting of the Munich Volkswirte Alumni, Munich, 13 June 2013. *      *      * 1.  Welcome Mr Baader Members of the Munich Volkswirte Alumni-Club Ladies and gentlemen I would like to extend a very warm welcome to you here at the Deutsche Bundesbank in Munich. At the same time, I wish to thank the Volkswirte Alumni-Club for inviting me to give this year’s lecture. Even at the Bundesbank, it is not every day that so many economists are gathered together, and the Bundesbank employs a large number of economists. I would therefore like to take this as an opportunity to talk about economists and their role in the crisis. Before that, however, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to this evening’s prize winners on receiving their awards. 2.  Have economists failed? On 6 April 2009, a severe earthquake occurred in the central Italian town of L’Aquila with the tragic loss of more than 300 lives. Only six days earlier, there had been a meeting of a national commission for the forecast and prevention of major risks. Afterwards, the experts made a public declaration that, despite a few tremors over the past few days, there was currently no heightened risk of an earthquake in the region. Ladies and gentlemen I am telling you about this incident because it is possible to draw instructive parallels with the role played by economists in the crisis. In much the same way as seismologists are accused of not giving ample warning about the possibility of an earthquake, economists are accused of not giving ample warning about the looming financial and debt crisis. And much as engineers are accused of making buildings that are not earthquake-resistant, economists are accused of building design flaws into the financial and economic system, with whole nations now suffering under the consequences. Economists have never had the best of reputations, even in the academic world. Many may feel that the topics which occupy economists are too common or vulgar – such as money. As Silvio Gesell wrote in 1911, “Lofty idealists can easily find subjects of investigation more attractive than money. Religion, biology, astronomy, for example, are infinitely more edifying than an investigation of the nature of money.” By the way, Silvio Gesell himself found this object of investigation interesting enough to develop his own theory of money, even though, from today’s perspective, it cannot exactly be classed as part of the mainstream. Fortunately, there have been a sufficient number of other “lofty idealists” in the ensuing 100 years who have found it attractive and edifying to study money and the economy. Over the course of time, economists have gained a fair amount of influence in policymaking, too, while the opponents of this development have long been branding it as the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  “economisation” of politics and society. With the 2007 financial crisis and the ensuing critical developments, unease about economists clearly grew, however. It has become fashionable to berate economists. For instance, Philip Stephens, the associate editor of the Financial Times, recently wrote that “The economy is too important to be left to economists”. In my view, the accusations levelled against economists are, at best, only partly justified, however. Allow me to use the events at L’Aquila again by way of illustration. The global financial crisis has often been described as a “quake on the financial markets”. But that is an unsatisfactory metaphor. And that is because the financial crisis, unlike an earthquake, is not a natural disaster. On the contrary, the crisis is 100% man-made. Economics is not an exact science: it is a social science. The laws of economics are not laws of nature. Earthquakes can be explained as natural phenomena. When, where and with what force an earthquake strikes cannot be predicted with any accuracy, however. It is nevertheless possible to say in advance which regions are at severe risk from earthquakes and which are less exposed. Certainly, financial stability reviews and other economic studies prior to the crisis contained some hints at shifts in the financial system. BIS, for example, gave repeated warnings about the setback potential stemming from the rapid growth in the credit securitisation and credit derivatives segments. Just to refresh your memory: between 2001 and 2007, the volume of credit default swaps grew by the factor of 100. The macroeconomic risks arising from this development on the financial markets were scarcely perceived, if they were perceived at all, however. One key reason for this is likely to be the fact that the financial markets were modelled, at best, in a rudimentary manner in the macro models that serve as an important basis for economic projections. Looking back, it is possible to say that financial economics and macro economics have made impressive progress over the past few decades – but unfortunately more in parallel than in cooperation with each other. It is only recently that research has switched to focusing more strongly on the interactions between the financial sector and the real economy. Talking of progress: The ongoing refinement of statistical-econometric methods and their application in economic research have brought to light significant insights. Nevertheless, the crisis has aroused some doubts about the triumphal progress of mathematics in the economic sciences. By contrast, economic historians, who were already thought to be in something of a backwater, are now attracting more attention again. Having said that, modern economic historians do indeed also make use of methods of empirical economic research, but look back further into the past than is customary. The book “This Time is Different” by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff is not only one of the best-selling books in the crisis literature; it has also been a reminder that financial and debt crises have been a constantly recurring phenomenon for centuries. One classic of financial history, “Manias, Panics and Crashes” by Charles P. Kindleberger, is rediscovered in every crisis. In it, Kindleberger shows in numerous episodes that earlier centuries repeatedly witnessed speculative bubbles and exaggerations on asset markets: tulip mania in 17th century Holland, for example, or the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Bubble in the 18th century, which perhaps triggered the first international financial crisis. Kindleberger cites one banker who invested in shares of the South Sea Company in 1720 as saying that, if the rest of the world takes leave of its senses, one must join in to a certain extent. That is very reminiscent of Chuck Prince, the former CEO of Citigroup, who, in 2007, came up with the legendary remark that “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  There’s nothing new under the sun, one might say in summary. 3.  Do economists have to rethink? 3.1  Financial market regulation Yet, the crisis has also called into question a number of economic policy paradigms. First and foremost, the financial and debt crisis has revealed design flaws in the financial and monetary systems. The liberalisation of the financial markets is now viewed much more critically than before the crisis. Confidence in the efficiency of the markets has been severely shaken by the financial crisis and many financial market products have failed to demonstrate that they promote macroeconomic welfare. Now, financial market regulation is being tightened because the negative macroeconomic consequences of financial crises have moved into the spotlight again. Lord Turner, the former Chairman of the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) came straight to the point in 2010 when talking about financial innovations and regulation, admitting self-critically “We were philosophically inclined to accept that if innovation created new markets and products that must be beneficial and that if regulation stymied innovation that must be bad. We are now more aware of the instability risks which might offset the benefits of such innovation.” 3.2  Role of the central banks Since the financial crisis, there has also been more discussion about the role played by central banks. First, experience of the financial crisis has again raised the question of how monetary policymakers should deal with asset price bubbles. The prevailing opinion before the crisis was that monetary policy is a blunt sword when dealing with exaggerations in the asset markets. To “prick a bubble”, interest rates would have to be increased so sharply that it would entail severe macroeconomic collateral damage. As a further argument against pricking bubbles, it was claimed that central banks were unable to identify the emergence of such bubbles any better or earlier than other well-informed market players. Instead, the central banks should clear up the mess, so to speak, after the bubble had burst by means of massive interest rate cuts and injections of liquidity. However, this approach, or as it is also known the Jackson Hole consensus, the Greenspan doctrine or simply the “mop-up strategy” was discredited by the crisis. Even though those in favour of bursting speculative bubbles are few and far between, a policy of actively leaning against the wind is now gaining more widespread support. This approach is often referred to as “more symmetrical monetary policy". However, this does not mean that monetary policy should assume responsibility for financial stability. Macroprudential policymakers have a more appropriate toolkit for safeguarding financial stability. In this context, the Act on Monitoring Financial Stability (Gesetz zur Überwachung der Finanzstabilität) assigns the Bundesbank important tasks in the field of macroprudential oversight. The Bank is responsible, in particular, for analysing factors that are key to financial stability, identifying risks, making proposals to the Financial Stability Committee regarding the issuing of warnings and recommendations, and evaluating the implementation of such warnings and recommendations. Nonetheless, in keeping with their mandate of safeguarding price stability, the monetary policymakers can also contribute towards the stability of the financial system by not encouraging financial market excesses. Monitoring the effect of credit aggregates on long-
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  term price developments regularly and meticulously, as the Eurosystem does as part of its monetary analysis, brings forth valuable information. It is a well-known fact that financial crises are typically preceded by excessive credit growth, or to quote Charles Kindleberger once again, “Most increases in the supply of credit do not lead to a mania – but nearly every mania has been associated with rapid growth in the supply of credit to a particular group of borrowers.” The extremely low interest rates we are currently seeing in many economies are associated with risks over the long term. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, highlighted this not long ago. Thus, all central banks are faced with the challenge of timing the tightening of the extremely loose monetary policy currently in place, should any risks to price stability emerge. Against the backdrop of low price pressures and weak economic growth in the euro area, the ECB Governing Council loosened its monetary policy stance once again in May, cutting the key interest rate to a new record low. It is not only in the euro area that monetary policy has buttressed the economy and financial system so greatly and on such an unprecedented scale since the outbreak of the crisis. As well as cutting interest rates to a record low, the Eurosystem has also adopted some unconventional measures, the most significant being a virtually unrestricted allotment of central bank liquidity, extending the maturities on central bank refinancing operations to three years, broadening the Eurosystem’s collateral framework and introducing outright transactions, which include sovereign bond purchases. In the course of the crisis, central banks were entrusted with ever more responsibility – both officially and unofficially. ESCB central banks play a central role in macroprudential supervision, ie as part of the European Systemic Risk Board, and the Bundesbank forms an integral part of the German Financial Stability Committee (Ausschuss für Finanzstabilität). The European single supervisory mechanism is to be placed under the aegis of the European Central Bank (ECB). Furthermore, in the wake of the crisis, policymakers, the markets and the media have talked up the Eurosystem as the only body capable of taking action. However, this entails the risk of overloading central banks with too many tasks and too much responsibility. The crisis management measures taken by central banks have set a debate in motion, both in the euro area and in other economic areas. It is a debate which is anything but pleasant, and, above all, one that seemed to be long since over. Following the inflation shocks in the 1970s, the 1980s saw a consensus gradually emerging that central banks should be primarily responsible for safeguarding price stability and need to be as independent as possible to perform this task. Independent central banks such as the Bundesbank or the Swiss National Bank proved to be more successful in combating inflation than other central banks which were under political direction. As a result, central banks around the world were granted independence so that they could credibly carry out the task of fighting inflation. However, of late, central banks’ independence and their price stability orientation have been called into question again. Indeed, central banks are not completely innocent with regard to this issue. They, too, have greatly stretched the boundaries of their mandate at times in the crisis. Otmar Issing fittingly commented on this problem recently, saying, “It is clear that the more tasks central banks take on which go beyond the policy framework established to safeguard price stability, the more they come into the firing line of political disputes. Central banks also endanger their independence when they promise more than what they are actually capable of delivering with the monetary policy instruments available to them”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  3.3  European monetary union The roots of the current crisis in the euro area notably include excessive lending fostered by insufficient financial market regulation, inadequate compliance with fiscal rules, inefficient use of capital inflows and a cumulative loss of competitiveness in several euro-area countries. Much like an earthquake exposes design flaws in a building’s construction, the financial crisis has clearly brought to light the dangerous cracks lurking in the structural framework of the monetary union. The cornerstones of the Maastricht framework include the concept of an independent central bank with the primary objective of safeguarding price stability, and national sovereignty in fiscal policy matters. The framework assigns liability for and control over national finances to national governments. The framework sets out fundamental principles to ensure compliance with this agreement. Member states commit themselves to maintaining sound public finances; they are strictly prohibited from providing each other with financial assistance (no-bail-out rule), although some exceptions were allowed; and central banks are not permitted to finance governments. However, the crisis management measures have seriously called into question the binding force of these rules. When monetary policy is called upon to carry out fiscal tasks, it will sooner or later lose its ability to maintain stable prices. Furthermore, we should only go down the avenue of comprehensively mutualising liability if the shift in liability to the European level is accompanied by the transfer of control. However, there are no signs that member states are willing to hand over veritable control and intervention rights to Brussels. It is impossible to say with absolute certainty whether a monetary union is crisis-proof. Economists had identified design flaws and pointed them out beforehand. In many respects, however, policymakers at the time ignored the advice given by economists. In his book “Making the European Monetary Union” the economic historian Harold James also made use of an engineering analogy. He stressed that “the monetary union without a well-established base in fiscal regime and without a stable financial system had a very high centre of gravity that made for vulnerability and instability”. Before the Maastricht framework was established, the Bundesbank, too, pointed out that monetary integration would not be sustainable in the long term without bringing about political integration. In its statement of 19 September 1990 on the establishment of economic and monetary union, the Bundesbank made its position clear by saying that a “monetary union is an irrevocable community of solidarity which, on the basis of experience, needs a more far-reaching commitment in the form of a comprehensive political union for it to be permanent”. However, instead of political union, the above-mentioned Maastricht framework was established, which since has proven to be vulnerable. As long as political union does not enjoy the backing of the European general public and their governments, however, then strengthening the Maastricht framework by introducing something like “Maastricht 2.0” is the right approach to return stability to monetary union. So what does “Maastricht 2.0” mean for me? • It means strengthening the principle of national responsibility by reinforcing the regulatory framework and, in doing so, realigning liability and control. • It means keeping the crisis mechanism as a last resort for staving off threats to financial stability in the euro area. Nonetheless, sovereign default and bank insolvencies must be possible in future without posing too large a risk to financial stability; this includes, I believe, bringing an end to the regulatory privileges enjoyed by sovereign debt. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • It also means establishing a banking union, encompassing both a single supervisory mechanism for systemically important financial institutions and a clear-cut resolution and restructuring regime. The necessity to recognise and acknowledge a banking union is without a doubt one of the greatest lessons learned from the euro-area crisis. Therefore, the establishment of a European banking union, which is already beginning to take form, is a key component in a stable monetary union. Combined with efficient regulation, it would lessen the burden placed on the single monetary policy and reduce the interdependencies between banks and sovereigns which have escalated the effects of the crisis. 4.  Conclusion I would like to conclude with a few remarks. The crisis which we have experienced in various forms since 2007 poses a huge challenge to economists. It has cast doubt on so many issues which were beyond debate before the crisis. It has also raised many new questions. Economists need to face up to these questions and critically assess their own roles and responsibilities. And they need to adopt a new mindset in many fields. • We need an intelligent financial market regulation. • We need to keep a closer eye on the stability of the financial system and • We need a crisis-proof framework for monetary union. Yet, at the same time, there are areas where a paradigm shift would not be appropriate. Independent monetary policy that is geared to safeguarding price stability and is clearly segregated from fiscal policy, has not been rendered obsolete by the crisis – quite the opposite, in fact, it is more important than ever before. So there is no need for economists to call everything into question as it were. Even Philip Stephens, FT associate editor, who I already cited above, offers some comfort in his Financial Times opinion piece when he remarks, “Economists are not always wrong”. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Introductory remarks at the French Assemblée Nationale Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the French Assemblée Nationale, Paris, 26 June 2013. *      *      * Presidents, Honourable Members of Parliament, I would like to thank you very warmly for having invited me to address this historic chamber. As President of the European Central Bank, it is an honour to speak in a nation that has done so much to promote and further the cause of European integration. It was exactly 300 years ago, in 1713, that the Abbé de Saint-Pierre presented his Project for Perpetual Peace, one of the first visions for a union between European nations. That this vision emerged into reality is thanks in large part to generations of French thinkers and pioneers, like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, and Aristide Briand. It is also thanks to the makers of the modern European Union like Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, and Jacques Delors. In other words, this country has played a key role in building the peaceful, open and united Europe we see today. But as you know, the EU, and the euro area in particular, is faced with important questions about its direction. It needs a new consensus on how to move forward. I am confident that France will again play a key role in that process. In my introductory remarks today, I would like to focus on three topics: the ECB’s monetary policy, growth and adjustment in the euro area, and the progress towards building a deeper economic and monetary union. I am here today to present the ECB’s views, but also to listen and to learn. I look forward to hearing your opinions and taking your questions. The ECB’s monetary policy Let me begin with the ECB’s monetary policy. The ECB’s mandate is to maintain price stability, which is essential to support long-term growth, defend citizens’ purchasing power and maintain sustainable and high employment. In order to deliver our mandate, the ECB has done a great deal to support the euro area economy. First, we have reduced our main interest rate to the historic low of 0.5%. Second, we have introduced a series of measures to ensure that banks can pass on these low interest rates to borrowers in the real economy. These measures include allowing banks to borrow as much liquidity from the ECB as they need; expanding the range of collateral they can use to access that liquidity; intervening in bond markets that were malfunctioning, like the sovereign bond market or the covered bond market; and launching two three-year Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs), which injected more than 1 trillion euro into the euro area banking system. Overall, our balance sheet increased from just below 1.5 trillion euro before the crisis to more than 3 trillion euro at its peak. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Our measures are primarily focused on banks because, in the euro area, bank lending is the main channel through which firms and households get access to finance. Around three quarters of firms’ external financing comes from banks, compared with only around one quarter in the United States. Supporting the banking system is therefore essential to support growth in the euro area – and to fulfil our mandate to maintain price stability. More recently, the ECB has acted to remove unfounded fears about the future integrity of our monetary union. These fears were creating severe turbulence in financial markets and preventing our low interest rates from reaching the countries where they were needed most. As a result, we saw a risk of a widespread credit crunch in these countries. Questions over fiscal sustainability and growing market distrust were starting to spill over into their respective banking sectors. The effects for growth and employment would have been severe. Indeed, investors were suddenly losing confidence that the euro area could survive in its current composition. The prospect that claims on governments and private companies in certain countries could not be discharged in euros had become a possibility. Our response was to introduce the programme of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), which allows for ex ante unlimited interventions in sovereign debt markets. OMT has been effective in restoring market functioning and trust in the euro area. For example, since the OMT announcement, bond markets have steadied, providing discipline without becoming destructive. Spreads on long-term bonds for Spain, Italy and Ireland have declined by around 150–250 basis points, and for Portugal by almost 500 basis points. And this has helped reduce financial fragmentation within the euro area, as shown by the best indicator we have for fragmentation, the level of Target balances. These have declined by 285 billion euros, or 25%, since the peak last year. France, like all other member states, has benefited significantly from this stabilisation. In short, the ECB has been very active in responding to the crisis. We have robustly defended the stability of our monetary union and therefore of our money. And we stand ready to act again when needed. However, it is important to acknowledge that there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve. This is not a question of the scope of our mandate. It is fundamentally about what different institutions are empowered to do. One pertinent example is the current shortage of credit for many households and small- and medium-sized enterprises. Credit provision requires funding, capital and a positive risk assessment. The central bank can help ensure funding and address macroeconomic risk. But it cannot provide capital, nor can it affect banks’ assessment of the creditworthiness of individual borrowers. Similarly, monetary policy cannot create real economic growth. If growth is stalling because the economy is not producing enough or because firms have lost competitiveness, this is beyond the power of the central bank to fix. Yet, the euro area needs sustainable growth. There are currently more than 19 million people unemployed in the euro area. Almost a quarter of young people are out of work. Such high levels of joblessness are a tragedy. Moreover, a weak economy means fewer taxpayers and lower revenues. This puts pressure on public finances, and ultimately on our social models. So what is the best way to achieve the growth Europe needs? Let me turn to this issue now and share with you some reflections on this subject. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Growth and adjustment in the euro area Some euro area countries have in the past relied on debt to support growth and fund social spending. But this path has led them to a difficult situation today. They have ended up with high public debts while growth has steadily fallen. In this country, for instance, public debt has risen from around 20% of GDP in 1980 to over 90% of GDP today. In that time, annual GDP growth averaged 2.3% in the 1980s, 1.9% in the 1990s, and 1.8% in the 2000s up to the crisis. This suggests that, for all euro area countries, a new approach is needed. An approach that can deliver growth and jobs, and sustain social models, without creating an unsustainable debt burden for future generations. In my view, this requires two complementary responses. The first response is to ensure that fiscal consolidation, which is necessary to contain debt levels, is made as growth-friendly as possible. For instance, relying less on tax increases would help sustain citizens’ disposable income. Prioritising capital investment over current spending would do more to lay the foundations for future growth. Structural fiscal reforms, for example to pension systems, would also help support fiscal sustainability without negative effects on the economy today. The second response is to raise competitiveness and increase the underlying productive capacity of our economies. Here, the frontier is reforms that target the structure of the economy. These include reducing barriers to entry for new firms and young people, and removing burdens on business like complex tax and labour laws or distortionary regulations. Reforms to the labour market are also essential to create the highest possible opportunities for employment. We are already seeing progress on rebalancing in the euro area: unit labour costs are coming down in countries where they had grown excessively; current account deficits are narrowing where there had been large imbalances in the past; and export growth is generally picking up in countries under strain. But in many euro area countries, the gap the between wages and productivity is still out of line with competitiveness. To increase employment, this gap should be closed and all the many policy levers that can contribute to this should be used. Changes to two-tier employment systems that protect insiders and harm outsiders are one such lever. Let us not forget that those who suffer the most from unreformed labour markets are often young people, as evidenced by the very high levels of youth employment today. I therefore welcome the joint initiative of the French and German Labour ministers to tackle this issue. This underscores an important point about reforms: by restoring competitiveness and creating opportunities for a wider range of people, they benefit the many, not the few. Reforms are an expression of solidarity between citizens. Solidarity across countries is also important, but it would be meaningless without solidarity within countries. Building a stronger EMU What role can the euro area as a whole play in supporting growth and stability across Europe? Governments are today reflecting deeply on this question. They are considering what was missing in the original design of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): what responsibilities need to be shared at the European level, and what not, to make EMU function effectively. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In my view, this debate should be driven by a single question: how can we best protect the vital interests of euro area citizens? And where the answer involves transferring sovereignty to the European level, we should not hesitate to do so. The best example of this is Banking Union. Banking Union is essential to ensure that we make permanent the progress made in reintegrating financial markets; that financial conditions in both core and periphery countries return to normal; and that our monetary union becomes truly single again. It has two indispensable elements: a strong Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and a strong Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). A strong system of common supervision is key to increase confidence in the health of euro area banks, which has been damaged due to supervisory failures in the past. Progress is already well underway here, and the Single Supervisory Mechanism will take over supervision one year after the legislation is adopted. But to ensure that common supervision is credible, it needs to be accompanied by a mechanism that can wind down failing banks without causing financial instability. This is why we need a Single Resolution Mechanism. And it needs to have a strong European dimension to be able to deal effectively with large, cross-border banks. But Banking Union is not the only example of where closer union is needed. Ultimately, the euro area needs to be drawing closer in all fields of economic policy. The recent call from the leaders of France and Germany for closer economic union shows that this message is being understood. But it is important that form is fully aligned with substance. In my view, a true economic union means three things. First, it means every country ensuring its national economy functions properly, without external imbalances and high unemployment. We cannot have a strong economic union without strong national economies. Second, it means transferring some sovereignty over decision-making to the European level – accepting decisions that are made for the good of the euro area as a whole, even if, at that moment in time, individual countries may disagree with them. Third, it means applying the same rules to all members of monetary union. This is not only a condition of fairness between countries, but also a pre-condition for deeper integration. Only if there is trust that each member will play by the rules can a union of mutual solidarity become possible. For these reasons, moving towards closer economic union also requires an equivalent deepening of political union. Greater authority at the European level must be matched by greater democratic legitimacy. And here both the European Parliament and national parliaments have a key role to play. As Herman van Rompuy has reminded us, national parliaments have become EU institutions. Conclusion Let me now conclude. The euro area has made much progress in recent years, but it still faces many challenges. Solving them requires EU institutions and national governments to work in concert. The ECB has done as much as it can to stabilise markets and support the economy. Now governments and parliaments need to do all they can to raise growth potential, strengthen competitiveness and build a stronger, more stable EMU. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  I was impressed to learn that, back in 1871, Victor Hugo called in this Assembly for a United States of Europe. France today can be equally ambitious in taking the euro area forward. Thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Thomas Jordan: Challenging economic and financial conditions for the Swiss banking sector Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the media news conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 20 June 2013. *      *      * The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is maintaining its minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. The Swiss franc is still high. An appreciation of the Swiss franc would compromise price stability and would have serious consequences for the Swiss economy. In the current environment, the minimum exchange rate remains important in order to avoid an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions for Switzerland in the event of sudden upward pressure on the Swiss franc. We stand ready to enforce the minimum exchange rate, if necessary, by buying foreign currency in unlimited quantities, and to take further measures, as required. The target range for the three-month Libor will be left unchanged at 0.0–0.25%. Since March, the SNB’s conditional inflation forecast has remained almost unchanged, apart from inflation for the current year, which is slightly lower due to a reduction in the oil price. The forecast is again based on an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.0% over the next three years. For 2013, we now anticipate slightly lower inflation of –0.3%. For 2014, the inflation forecast is unchanged at 0.2% and for 2015 at 0.7%. Consequently, inflation in Switzerland will remain very low in the foreseeable future. In the first quarter of 2013, the global economy was weaker than expected. The recession continued in the euro area. In the US, the recovery remained hesitant and in China, economic activity lost strength. In Switzerland, real GDP rose significantly in the first quarter. However, we expect a perceptible weakening in growth for the second quarter. Overall, we still anticipate growth of 1.0–1.5% for 2013.  The risks for the Swiss economy remain high. They continue to originate, for the most part, from the international environment. A weakening in global economic momentum cannot be excluded. Further developments in the euro area financial and sovereign debt crisis remain uncertain. Tensions can reappear at any moment on global financial markets. Domestically, there is a risk that the imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets will grow, given the sustained period of exceptionally low interest rates.  Global economic outlook I would now like to outline the outlook for the global economy and Switzerland in more detail. I will then look at monetary and financial conditions and the SNB’s monetary policy.  In the first quarter, the growth of the global economy was weaker than expected, across the board. In many emerging markets, particularly China, economic activity lost strength. In the euro area, the recession continued, and in the US, the recovery remained hesitant. The only advanced economy to gain significant momentum was Japan. However, in the quarters ahead, global growth is likely to firm up gradually. In the US, the recovery will be supported by the labour market and rising asset prices. In Japan, the very expansionary economic policy is having an invigorating effect. Due to the upturn in world trade and the improvement in financing conditions, the euro area is also likely to emerge gradually from recession. In addition, the burden imposed by budget consolidation will be lower next year.  Overall, however, the outlook remains uncertain. The risk of a deterioration in the global economy continues to be high. As before, the biggest risk remains a renewed deterioration in the euro area financial and sovereign debt crisis. Even though our baseline scenario 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches assumes a gradual solution of the crisis, it is possible that tensions could re-emerge on financial markets at any time.  Swiss economic outlook In Switzerland, the economy experienced a temporary revival in the first quarter, as expected, and real GDP rose by 2.3%, in annualised terms. Thus, we experienced more favourable growth than our neighbouring countries. The difference is primarily attributable to domestic demand. Once again, growth was mainly driven by private consumption and investment in residential construction. These demand components benefited from the relatively robust labour market, a continued strong inflow of immigrants and the favourable financing conditions. In particular, the supply of credit in Switzerland is currently having a much stronger effect on the real economy than in most European countries.  In the case of exports, however, there are no indications of a lasting revival. Since the beginning of 2011, real exports have been moving sideways. They are being held back not only by the high value of the Swiss franc, but also by the subdued momentum in world trade. Moreover, investment by Swiss companies is hesitant. One reason for this is uncertainty about further developments in the global economy. However, further factors dampening investment activity are pressure on profit margins and the continued overcapacity in parts of the manufacturing industry. According to information derived from the quarterly survey carried out by SNB regional delegates, this cautious approach will persist in the near future. This means that domestic equipment investment in 2013 will probably stagnate. On the output side, too, developments were mixed in the first quarter. Construction, banking, insurance and health recorded clearly positive growth figures. In manufacturing, business activity merely stabilised. In this area, the situation in the metal processing and machine industries, in particular, remains difficult. Both of these industries are suffering from weak industrial activity and the lack of investment demand on the part of companies in many European countries. Most recently, growth in employment has slowed, and unemployment has risen again somewhat, in seasonally-adjusted terms. We expect that unemployment figures will increase again marginally to the end of the year. For the second quarter, we forecast a perceptible weakening in growth compared to the strong first quarter. In the following quarters, if the recovery of the global economy strengthens, economic momentum is likely to increase gradually again. We continue to expect growth of 1.0–1.5% for the year 2013 as a whole. Consequently, we do not expect that the Swiss economy will return to full utilisation of production capacity in the near future. Monetary and financial conditions  I will now turn to monetary and financial conditions.  In recent weeks, volatility in financial markets has again increased. Since the last monetary policy assessment, however, the export-weighted external value of the Swiss franc has remained largely unchanged. Recent developments suggest that safe-haven considerations continue to play an important role in the demand for Swiss francs. Overall, the value of the Swiss franc remains high and should fall further over the next few quarters.  The level of interest rates in Switzerland remained very low in the first quarter. On the secured Swiss franc money market, interest rates are in negative territory. Yields at issue for Confederation money market debt register claims also continue to be negative. By contrast, yields on ten-year Confederation bonds have risen slightly from the lows reached last December. Movements in long-term interest rates show that demand for secure investments 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 reacts strongly to the international environment. My colleague, Fritz Zurbrügg, will talk about developments on financial markets in more detail afterwards. Banks’ sight deposits at the SNB have not increased any further since September 2012. However, growth in the M1, M2 and M3 monetary aggregates, which measure the amount of money held by households and companies, remained strong. This growth in money was accompanied by robust lending on the part of banks. Although the rate of growth of mortgage loans to households has declined since mid-2012, it is still at a high level. Most recently, mortgage lending to companies, in particular in residential construction, has increased significantly.  Overall, lending has been growing faster than nominal GDP for several years. In addition, prices for owner-occupied apartments and single-family homes have risen strongly in the past few years. Given the sustained period of exceptionally low interest rates, there is a risk that the imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets will increase further. This development jeopardises financial stability and, in the event of an abrupt correction, can have wide-reaching consequences for the real economy.  SNB monetary policy Ladies and gentlemen, the SNB continues to face major challenges. In particular, the threat that the Swiss franc could suddenly come under upward pressure again has not been averted. In the current low interest rate environment, therefore, the minimum exchange rate remains the focal instrument for ensuring appropriate monetary conditions.  The financial crisis has shown that for balanced economic development more than just price stability is required; financial stability must also be guaranteed. In Switzerland, the fact that the SNB is required to contribute to ensuring financial stability was already laid down in the National Bank Act of 2004. Our annual Financial Stability Report is an important instrument in this respect. It draws attention to emerging imbalances and the existence of risks which, in our view, could jeopardise the stability of the banking industry as a whole in the medium term. In addition, last year a new instrument was created – the countercyclical capital buffer – based on the lessons drawn from the financial crisis. At the beginning of the year, the SNB proposed that this buffer be activated, and the Federal Council decided in favour of an activation in February. The countercyclical capital buffer will come into effect from the end of September 2013 and will strengthen the resilience of the banking industry. Moreover, it will help to counter a further build-up of imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets. My colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will now give you our assessment of the risks in the financial sector.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Fritz Zurbrügg: A snapshot of the financial situation in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Fritz Zurbrügg, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the media news conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 20 June 2013. *      *      * I will begin today with the situation on the financial markets. Then I will address the management of our currency reserves, before moving on to trends in the money market, as well as the current discussion regarding reference interest rates. Finally, I will say a few words on the future of the repo market infrastructure in Switzerland. Developments on the financial markets In December, at the last news conference, I remarked on an easing of tensions on the financial markets. This easing largely continued in the first half of 2013. The government bonds of the European peripheral countries, in particular, benefited from the greater trust of investors, with Ireland and Portugal raising funds via long-term bonds on the capital market for the first time since 2010 and 2011, respectively.  The buoyant mood on the financial markets was also demonstrated on the advanced economies’ stock markets. In May, there were new historical highs in the US, the UK and Switzerland. Investors’ risk appetite was encouraged not least by the very expansionary monetary policy around the world. Various central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB), again reduced their key interest rates early this year. The prospect of low yields on bond markets induced many investors to increase their equity investments. In Japan, monetary policy announcements resulted in significantly improved investor sentiment, with the Nikkei stock index climbing by 80% between November 2012 and May 2013 on the back of a strongly depreciated yen and the ensuing higher profit expectations of Japanese companies.  In the positive risk climate, investments perceived as secure have lost value. A prominent example is gold: The dollar price per fine ounce of gold had risen in 2011 to a high of USD 1,900. Currently, it is approximately a quarter lower. Government bonds perceived as secure have also fallen in value, even though their yields are still very low. This also applies to Confederation bonds. While the yield on ten-year Confederation bonds, for example, has significantly increased since the low point of last December, at around 0.8% it is still extremely low. Movements in the Swiss franc exchange rate matched this risk-friendly market environment. Since January, the euro/Swiss franc exchange rate has moved further away from the minimum rate of CHF 1.20, and at times, values were recorded which were last seen in Spring 2011, in other words, before the introduction of the minimum exchange rate. On a trade-weighted basis, however, the Swiss franc has remained largely unchanged since the beginning of the year.  The favourable developments on the financial markets, which have persisted over a lengthy period, were the result of a reduction in extreme risks. This was due, on the one hand, to measures taken by the ECB, and on the other, to the fact that, in the US, the ‘fiscal cliff’ was averted. As recent weeks have shown, conditions on the financial markets can change again swiftly. In Japan, there has been a sharp correction on the stock market and the yen has again gained somewhat in value. Meanwhile, in the euro area, there is a discrepancy between the  generally favourable trend on the financial markets and the disappointing economic data. Finally, in the US, a certain degree of uncertainty about the future monetary policy direction of the Federal Reserve (Fed) has gained ground. Overall, the market 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches environment continues to be dominated by high levels of uncertainty, thereby remaining susceptible to sudden shifts in mood. Management of currency reserves The easing of tensions on the financial markets also affected the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) currency reserves. These are mainly composed of foreign currency investments and gold. At the end of May, the SNB held foreign currency investments of just over CHF 440 billion (cf. chart 1). Due to our liquidity and security requirements, a large portion of our foreign exchange holdings are in government bonds and deposits with other central banks. This portion amounted to 78% at the end of the first quarter of 2013. To further diversify investment risk and increase investment in real assets, we raised our proportion of equities from 12% to 15% in the first quarter. We currently hold equities worth around CHF 65 billion, which is three times more than at the end of 2011. In this regard, we have widened our scope to include shares of companies with relatively small market capitalisation, as well as those in advanced economies not previously considered, with the result that our equity portfolio now covers all advanced economies. Since we have invested relatively little in these new markets, our currency allocation has hardly changed in recent months. The proportion of gold in the currency reserves amounted to 10% at the end of the first quarter of 2013. From an investment viewpoint, gold is important for a good diversification of the currency reserves. Historically, gold often moves in an opposite direction to other assets. In contrast to equities or bonds, however, gold does not yield interest or dividends. And as the recent months have shown, gold is also among the most volatile and therefore most risky investments, with a noteworthy example occurring in April, when the gold price fell by about 15% in less than a week.  Last December, the SNB announced it would be opening a branch office in Singapore. This will enable us to more efficiently manage our foreign currency investments, which have risen sharply, to expand our market coverage in Asia, and to position ourselves closer to key market participants. Singapore is one of the most significant trading centres for bonds in Asia. At the same time, the branch office in Singapore will facilitate the enforcement of the minimum exchange rate. It will open in July, with a staff of seven. The Singapore office will concern itself only with trading; settlement will continue to take place in Zurich. The branch office is completely subordinate to existing SNB oversight and control. Swiss franc money market and reference interest rates The continuing high level of Swiss franc liquidity has had the desired effect of keeping money market interest rates at close to zero. The three-month Libor has been at around two basis points since mid-January. Interest rate expectations, based on Libor future contracts, are also close to zero for the foreseeable future, but not negative, as was the case over much of last year. As a result of the very low money market interest rates and high liquidity in the banking sector, money market turnover has dropped substantially in recent years. This is illustrated in chart 2, which shows the total of banks’ sight deposits at the SNB, as well as turnover in the area of secured and unsecured call money. The small number of transactions on the money market is a problem for generating representative reference interest rates. In addition, the selection and setting of reference interest rates has come under the scrutiny of market participants and the public, as a consequence of the Libor manipulation.  As regards the problems surrounding the Libor, efforts at reform are underway on an international level. To ensure the continuation of the Libor, a raft of measures have already been initiated. These include both an improved regulatory framework for the Libor fixing, as well as enforced oversight by the relevant authorities. The aim is to make the Libor more representative and to restore the trust of market participants. Aside from these regulatory 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 steps, what is also vital for the continued existence of the Libor is that an adequate number of banks participate in the Libor fixing, and that the money market upon which the Libor fixing is based recovers its importance.  Credible and representative reference interest rates are of major importance for the financial markets. They serve as benchmarks in the pricing of loans, financial products and derivatives. In Switzerland, approximately 80% of banks use the Libor as a benchmark for loans, especially for mortgages. The responsibility for the provision of reference interest rates therefore lies primarily with the market participants. They should be aware of this responsibility, and become involved, where necessary, in exploring alternative reference interest rates. The SNB is playing a supportive role in this regard, in that it is participating in discussions with market participants, as well as with Swiss and foreign authorities. Future of the repo market infrastructure in Switzerland With regard to repo market infrastructure, it is important that we are well prepared for the future. A functioning, secure and efficient repo market is vital for the implementation of monetary policy, as well as for market participants’ access to central bank liquidity. Switzerland has a long tradition of organising its core financial market infrastructure as a joint enterprise, according to the ‘user-owned, user-governed’ principle. In the case of the repo market, the current solution has proven its worth. Nonetheless, due to changes in the stock market and regulatory environment, the SNB has undertaken a reassessment of the situation. In the light of this, the SNB has decided to conduct its monetary policy operations via a new trading platform, provided by SIX Group Ltd, as of May 2014. In this way, the repo market will be based on an integrated solution, in which the trading platform, securities settlement system and payment system are covered by a single source. Moreover, further developments will also be possible, for example the expansion of trading to incorporate further products. Since the new trading platform will resemble the existing Swiss franc repo system (Eurex Repo), access for market participants will entail only minimal adjustments. We are confident that an integrated solution is the best means of ensuring a robust repo market infrastructure.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jörg Asmussen: The global crisis – lessons for international policy cooperation Speech by Mr Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Kiel, 23 June 2013. *      *      * Sehr geehrter Herr Ministerpräsident, sehr geehrte Frau Oberbürgermeisterin, sehr geehrter Herr Professor Snower, dear laureates, meine Damen und Herren, It is my pleasure to be here today in Kiel and warmly congratulate Gro Harlem Brundtland, Joseph Stiglitz and Mohammed Ibrahim for winning the 2013 Global Economy prize. This prize has high reputation at the ECB where we believe that international cooperation and openness are crucial for improving people’s standards of living. Some of you might recall that the prize was awarded in 2011 to former ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet. I would like to focus my intervention today on some lessons that can be drawn from the global financial crisis for international policy cooperation. I will start with a question. Does the crisis call for a substantial change in the approach to international policy cooperation? My answer is yes, for the following three reasons: First, the world has become more interconnected and shocks are transmitted more rapidly across countries. Consider the following figures on global financial integration: Total foreign assets and liabilities of advanced economies rose from 68% of GDP in 1980 to almost 450% of GDP in 2010. The synchronisation of a severe economic and financial downturn, after the failures of major financial institutions in 2008, is a stark reminder of the significant interdependence of our economies. In 2009, 40 out of the 50 largest economies in the world experienced severe recessions. Second, we need a new approach to international cooperation because the potential sources of shocks have multiplied. Alongside domestic shocks, countries are now more exposed than in the past to external financial shocks and global shocks to confidence. Keeping one’s “house in order” is no longer sufficient to fully insulate domestic economies from these shocks. Third, we need a new approach to international cooperation because the crisis has unveiled structural vulnerabilities in the global economy. In particular, our current institutions were designed for the economic system of the 20th century. They are not suitable for the global challenges of the 21st century. Global economic cooperation is needed to design better institutions. For these three reasons, we have to take the crisis as a serious opportunity to tune global policy making to today’s interconnected world. The stakes are high, because the economic and social cost of the crisis has been large. Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, has significantly increased since 2008. As many as 73 million young people are estimated to be unemployed globally in 2013, especially in advanced economies – including the euro area – the Middle East and North Africa. Would reversing globalisation solve the problem? 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  My answer is no. Being in northern Germany today, with its long tradition of openness and free trade ever since many of the cities along the Baltic coast joined the Hanseatic League, is a stark reminder of the benefits of global and European integration. And perhaps the case of Germany shows these benefits even more clearly: • The share of Germany in global exports stood at around 8% in 2012. This makes Germany the largest global exporter after China (10%) and the US (9.8%). • Exports of goods and service from Germany to the rest of the EU increased from around 20% of German GDP in 2000, to around 30% of GDP in 2012. • Exports from Germany to the rest of the world increased from around 30% of GDP in 2000 to more than 50 % of GDP in 2012. Protectionism would clearly harm Germany and Europe. Therefore, we should not turn our back on globalisation. We should rather learn to better reap its benefits and make it more inclusive, in ways such that benefits are also fairly shared. The crisis offers an opportunity to learn from past mistakes. At the domestic level, it shows the importance of addressing imbalances with sound policies and structural reforms. At the global level, it shows the real cost of non-cooperative attitudes and policies. It therefore calls for a substantial change in institutional and governance frameworks for international policy cooperation. Let me first identify past mistakes by considering the main vulnerabilities unveiled by the crisis, both at the global and European level. On the global front, the crisis mainly revealed the existence of global economic governance failures and weak surveillance mechanisms. Global imbalances led to the accumulation of fragilities in the global financial system and to unsustainable global macroeconomic outcomes. For example, long term interest rates in the US and globally did not respond as expected to the Federal Reserve tightening cycle which started in 2004. This unusual behaviour of long term interest rates, which reflected the global savings glut, was labelled “Conundrum” by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Persistently low long-term interest rates led to an aggressive search for yield and capital misallocations in the financial system. How the impact of domestic policies could spill over to other countries was not sufficiently appreciated. And the need for stronger international cooperation on this front was not recognised that much before the crisis either. In 2007 the IMF attempted to broaden the focus of bilateral surveillance to the implications of domestic policies for external sustainability. The attempt failed because some countries resisted to having their exchange rates labelled as “fundamentally misaligned” and to adjust their policies accordingly. A forum for global economic governance tuned to the economic realities of the 21st century was missing. Institutional frameworks to create sufficient peer pressure at the global level to prompt systemic players to act were weak. Thus, global economic governance and multilateral surveillance were not fully equipped for the new challenges of a globalised world. But the crisis also revealed acute failures in the global financial system. While financial sectors became increasingly international, supervision and regulation remained largely national in scope and only loosely coordinated at the international level. This encouraged regulatory arbitrage, the creation of large, complex financial intermediaries, and poor risk management practises. Several of these features also characterised our European continent. The crisis revealed fragilities in the governance, surveillance frameworks and financial architecture of the euro area. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The rules and governance framework associated with the Stability and Growth Pact were not sufficiently enforced and, therefore, respected. Efforts to promote structural reforms, for example under the Lisbon Agenda, were weak. As we know now too well, macroeconomic imbalances within the euro area grew unabated. Competitiveness developments across Member States diverged to an unsustainable extent. For instance, a harmonised indicator of price competitiveness shows that between 2000 and 2008 Germany became almost 20% more competitive in real terms vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area average. Over the same period, price competitiveness decreased by around 10% in Italy and Spain vis-à-vis the euro area average. In addition, despite the unprecedented level of financial integration in the euro area, banking supervision remained domestic. Cross-border resolution frameworks, in turn, did not reflect the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of the European banking system. Overall, inappropriate policies in one country in the euro area could create negative externalities for other euro area countries, and possibly destabilise the monetary union as a whole. The crisis hence revealed that the euro area needs much stronger mechanisms to correct inappropriate domestic policies. It also revealed that the euro area’s ability to absorb shocks, especially asymmetric ones, and its frameworks for crisis management and resolution need to be significantly strengthened. What has been done so far to address the global and European vulnerabilities that were revealed by the crisis? Let me start with the global perspective. Economic governance and surveillance mechanisms have been strengthened appreciably. The G20 was upgraded to the Leaders’ level, replacing the G7 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation. This made governance more encompassing and legitimate. The G20 represents 65% of the world population (including the EU), while the G7 represented slightly more than 10% of it. The key emerging market economies are now at the table. The first three G20 Leaders’ summits (Washington, London and Pittsburgh) led to important achievements, including a coordinated policy response to the cyclical downturn, a solemn commitment to keep the global economy open and more resources to the IMF. The G20 also gave political impetus to a broad agenda for financial reform to make the global financial system more stable and more resilient. Work is under way in different fora to fill regulatory gaps, make regulation more consistent across countries, limit the possibility for arbitrage, improve supervision of cross-border institutions and facilitate their resolution. The crisis has also led to radical changes in the European institutional and governance framework. In little less than four years, we have created the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a permanent crisis resolution mechanism for the euro area. We have also strengthened euro area economic governance, for instance through the “Fiscal Compact” and the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. The creation of the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) at the ECB is also under way. It will make supervision consistent with the level of banking integration in Europe. These are essential elements needed to break the adverse feedback loop between banks and sovereigns. What needs to be done to finish the job and make the global economic and financial system more stable and resilient to reap the benefits of globalisation fully? We still have a long way to go, admittedly, and this is still not the time to rest on our laurels. Let me hence sketch what issues remain unsolved. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The global reform agenda has lost momentum, as the sense of urgency imposed by the crisis has vanished. On the global financial reform front, for instance, progress has slowed down in several respects. This has generated frustration and led to country-specific regulatory initiatives. These initiatives should not create market distortions, harm global and European financial integration or lead to regulatory arbitrage. Progress on the front of global economic policy-making has also slowed down. The G20’s effectiveness is now being questioned. Being larger than the G7, it is also more heterogeneous in terms of values and represented interests. Therefore, reaching an agreement at the negotiation table is more challenging. Also, the G20 might appear distant to citizens, which is not helpful for legitimacy, as the latter is intrinsically linked to local proximity. Finally, not all countries are at the table. An entire continent like Africa is only represented by one country, namely South Africa. Despite its limitations, the G20 remains essential for global economic cooperation insofar as there is no obvious alternative. Returning only to the G7 or the G8 is not an option. At the same time, it was premature to conclude that the former formats are dead with the rise of the G20. The conclusions of this week’s G8 Summit in Northern-Ireland on fighting tax evasion and on world trade for example showed that the smaller formats can stimulate important momentum for the G20 and other fora like the WTO. Where do we stand on the European front? An essential lesson from the crisis is that the Economic and Monetary Union is an incomplete project. The “Four Presidents” Report outlined the necessary steps to move towards a genuine monetary union, which I strongly support. First, we need to complete with great urgency the banking union. We need a clear and transparent assessment of the conditions of the banking system (“asset review”) before the Single Supervisory Mechanism takes over. We also need a strong commitment towards an effective Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) which is an indispensable element of the banking union and a necessary complement to the SSM. The SRM would allow for a smooth winding down of banks, especially those with large cross-border activities. It needs to entail both a strong Single Resolution Authority (SRA) as well as a Single Resolution Fund (SRF). The latter should be financed with ex-ante risk based levies on the banking sector. These arrangements would enhance the credibility of the system and ultimately break the link between banks and sovereigns. Second, we need to further strengthen and integrate our economic governance frameworks to make our economies more competitive and resilient to asymmetric shocks. One front on which European governance can greatly improve relates to structural reforms. Ultimately, structural reforms benefit the many at the expense of the few. A recent OECD Report called this the “Double Dividend” of structural reforms: they increase growth, and if implemented properly, decrease inequality. One way to create incentives for Member States to engage in structural reforms could be the provision of temporary financial assistance to alleviate the short-term costs of reforms, in exchange of a contractual agreement to complete them. The contract would entail clear goals in line with EU policies and measurable targets. These contracts could be useful in several instances, especially in the presence of “reform and bailout fatigue”, and constrained public finances. Third, the increasing level of integration within Europe calls for a new institutional design to ensure legitimation, accountability and democratic control. On the one hand, Governments should ensure that national parliaments are appropriately informed and involved in decision processes. On the other hand, national parliaments are often not in the best position to incorporate the EU common interest in their decisions. Therefore, European institutions should be strengthened, in particular the European Parliament which could maybe also 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  convene in a euro area format. This would ensure that the level of accountability matches the level at which decisions are taken. It is time for me to conclude, Globalisation has lifted out of poverty and improved the living standards of millions around the world. It has greatly benefited Germany and the rest of Europe. It has benefited emerging Asia. And it is now benefiting large parts of Africa. We should not reverse globalisation. We should rather elevate our game and adapt our toolkit to the new realities of the 21st century. This will enable us to reap the full benefits of globalisation and share gains more fairly. Stronger international policy cooperation would help to deliver stronger, more sustainable and balanced growth globally. It is the best means to avoid currency wars. It would help to make growth more inclusive and decrease unemployment, especially among the youth. It would increase peer pressure, thereby improving governance, especially in developing countries. Stronger international policy cooperation would also help to make growth models more compatible with the scarcity of natural resources and environmental constraints. The crisis has offered an opportunity to learn from past mistakes. This opportunity should not go wasted. As the sense of urgency imposed by the crisis vanishes, the risk is that complacency slows down reforms, while the road that lies in front of us is still long. But the decision to complete the global reform agenda through enhanced international cooperation is entirely in our hands. This is why I believe that the Kiel prize for the Global economy is a reminder for us of the importance of globalisation and international cooperation. Therefore, I want to conclude with warm congratulations to the winners of the prize. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mervyn King: A Governor looks back – and forward Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, London, 19 June 2013. *      *      * My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen: Chancellor: thank you for those generous words. It has been a privilege to work with you over the past three years, a period of great change both at home and abroad. Your support for the Bank has been much appreciated at this end of town, and you have changed for the better the regulatory framework that oversees the City. But we both know that the past few years would have been much more difficult without the continual support of two people. And I am so pleased that both Frances and Barbara are with us tonight. And I’m particularly happy, George, that neither you nor I have to speak after either of them because experience suggests that we would suffer from the comparison. Lord Mayor: let me thank you too for presiding over my final Mansion House Dinner. We have enjoyed many musical evenings together, and Barbara and I look forward to sharing many more with you and Clare after you shed the chains of office later this year. The City has been extremely fortunate to benefit from your energy, drive and can-do attitude as Lord Mayor. I shall not detain you this evening with a retrospective examination of my time as Governor. Suffice it to say that it was a game of two halves. And, far from a boring goalless draw, it turned out to be a rather exciting and dramatic game, full of incident, with a red card or two and a passionate and at times justifiably angry crowd. We shall have to wait for the historians of tomorrow to file the full match report. Instead, tonight I want to focus on the twin challenges of engineering a recovery and reforming the financial system. I want to look back on the huge amount that has been done, and look forward to the unfinished business on both fronts, much of it for the Bank of England. I shall also tell you a story about the Governor of the Bank of England, the Governor of the Bank of Canada and a certain Mr Osborne. But that comes later. Since 2008, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee has gone to extraordinary lengths to stabilise the economy and support growth and employment. In fact, we have pursued what I have called the “paradox of policy”: doing in the short run, by encouraging spending through an unprecedentedly loose monetary policy, the opposite of what we need to do in the long run, which is to raise national saving. But that has been necessary to prevent an even worse recession, and without similar action from other central banks the world might have experienced a major depression. Now there are clear signs that a recovery in the UK, albeit modest, is underway. From the beginning of this year, business surveys have improved, broad money growth has stabilised at around 5% a year, and the housing market is picking up. Despite this encouraging picture, growth is not yet strong enough to reduce the considerable margin of spare capacity in the economy. Nor is recovery at an adequate rate fully assured. The weakness of the euro area and the problems of the UK banking system continue to act as a drag on growth. So the need to support the recovery remains. Of course we must be mindful of the risks from injecting more money into the economy. We cannot afford to return to the inflationary episodes of the past. In the two decades before inflation targeting was introduced in 1992, inflation averaged almost 10% a year. The purpose of inflation targeting was to change the way in which interest rate decisions were made and to build credibility in the UK’s commitment to price stability. Over the following two decades, CPI inflation averaged only a fraction above 2%. Today, inflation is above the 2% target – as it has been for most of the past five years. But our economy has had to absorb an 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  oil price shock on a par with that of the 1970s, as well as a sharp depreciation of sterling. And yet there are few signs of domestically generated inflation, which has remained close to 2%.1   Pay rises and underlying inflationary pressure are low, and the medium-term outlook is for inflation to fall back to the target. Inflation targeting achieved its objective. The greater risk at present is that, over the next few years, unemployment remains unnecessarily high. We must not forget that one million more people are out of work than in the five years before the crisis. It is too soon to say the job of securing recovery is complete. There is a powerful case for more stimulus in the short run. The present extraordinary monetary policies cannot, however, continue indefinitely. Both nominal and real interest rates are at unsustainably low levels. There is an understandable yearning for a return to normality. And in recent weeks bond yields have risen – up around 45 basis points since the start of May. But such market moves should not be confused with a return to normality. A rapid return to higher interest rates would do great damage to the balance sheets of highly indebted households, companies and, especially, financial institutions. The challenge in returning to normality is not so much managing market expectations when that eventually happens, important though that is, but in creating the economic conditions in which it is sensible to return to more normal levels of interest rates. The real challenge – on a global scale – is to rebalance the world economy so that very low interest rates are not required to exhort deficit countries to spend in order to absorb the surpluses elsewhere. Monetary policy cannot provide the answer. It can only buy time to bring about the necessary structural changes in investment, trade and capital flows. Whether they involve changes in currency values or restructuring of debt is a political choice, but a failure to deal with global imbalances will not only retard the recovery in the world as a whole, but worsen the scale of the adjustment ultimately needed. It will inevitably be a bumpy ride. The other obstacle to a return to normality is our banking system where, despite the generous provision of liquidity and funding from the State, lending remains lacklustre, and risk premia high. Although the combined balance sheet of our largest banks has shrunk since the height of the crisis in 2008, it is still 400% of annual GDP. Leverage ratios have fallen, but all our major banks remain highly leveraged. And of course the two biggest lenders to the domestic economy remain largely in state ownership. It is difficult to imagine a banking sector like that making a real contribution to any economic recovery. It must be time for decisive action. Chancellor, you have made clear tonight that you embrace that view. Britain needs a thriving banking system to serve households and businesses, and Lloyds and RBS will be able to play that role to the full only when back in the private sector. I welcome your announcement that Lloyds Banking Group will be returned to private hands soon. And I very much support your plans for a full review of the future structure of RBS. The return of banking supervision to the Bank of England has also seen decisive actions. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and the new Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have acted quickly to make our banking system more resilient. In March, the FPC recommended that banks’ capital should be assessed using more prudent estimates of expected losses and risk weights. Since April, the Board of the PRA has been making those assessments and asking banks to take action to deal with any shortfall of capital. That work is now complete, the banks know the results, and tomorrow we will publish them for each of the major banks. In total, the eight largest banks have a capital shortfall of around £25bn relative to the standard recommended by the FPC. After this exercise, our major banks all now have plans for actions to fill that shortfall. The first evidence is the announcement on                                                 1  As measured by the rate of increase in the GDP deflator. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Monday by the Co-operative Bank. Others will follow. By taking firm pre-emptive action, we have shown what the new judgement-led approach to supervision means in practice. It substitutes substance for process and judgement for box-ticking. We need not more but better regulation and, just as with monetary policy, we have changed the way regulatory decisions are made. The PRA announcement tomorrow is another step in dealing with the legacy of the past. It will make our banking system more resilient and better able to support recovery. But it is too soon to say that the job is done. Many of our major lenders will still be highly levered. The levels of capital required by the Vickers reforms, on the one hand, and the Basel standards for large international banks, on the other, mean that there is clearly some way to go before we can claim to have a really well-capitalised banking system. In future, the FPC and the PRA will work together to conduct regular stress tests of our banks, starting in 2014. Those stress tests will I am sure be made public, and banks will be expected to set out their plans for making up any identified shortfall in capital. Managing this process, and the transition to a higher level of capital, will be key tasks for the FPC and PRA in the coming years. Those who argue that requiring higher levels of capital will necessarily restrict lending are wrong. The reverse is true. It is insufficient capital that restricts lending. That is why some of our weaker banks are shrinking their balance sheets. Capital supports lending and provides resilience. And, without a resilient banking system, it will be difficult to sustain a recovery. Although higher capital does not restrict lending, requirements to hold more liquid assets do. Every pound of additional holdings of liquid assets is a pound that could otherwise be lent to the real economy. That is why the Bank has stood ready, through the Special Liquidity Scheme, its new Discount Window Facility, through its market operations (including the ECTR) and through its Funding for Lending Scheme, to provide a backstop for the liquidity needs of the banking system – against adequate collateral and at an appropriate interest rate. Given that backstop, the FPC has over the past year been recommending that regulatory requirements to hold liquid assets should be loosened. The Bank’s provision of liquidity to the banking system has been transformed out of all recognition in the past six years. But here too there is unfinished business. We asked Bill Winters to review our system and make recommendations for further changes. We have reviewed his proposals and will soon be taking steps to expand our regular auctions to a wider pool of collateral and to make our Discount Window Facility both cheaper and more easily accessible. All these policy actions have and will put our economy in position for a recovery. But we must also ensure that our financial system is truly reformed in a way that reflects the lessons of the financial crisis. At this Dinner six years ago, before the crisis began, I said, “Excessive leverage is the common theme of many financial crises of the past. Are we really so much cleverer than the financiers of the past?” We are all much wiser now. And this country can claim to have been in the vanguard in learning lessons. Much has been done. But we cannot be complacent. As the memories of the crisis fade, and those who saw it at first hand retire, it is vital that the ‘audacity of pessimism’ is not lost. We must deal once and for all with the problem of financial institutions that are too big, or too important, to fail. Some progress has been made. When the crisis hit, we in the UK had neither an effective deposit insurance scheme nor a resolution framework to deal with failing banks. Now we have both. But there is unfinished business. Although the UK is leading the way in the development of agreements among regulators worldwide as to how the largest banks could be resolved, managing cross-border resolutions is still fraught with difficulty. We also need to implement the proposals of the Independent Commission on Banking as soon as possible, including the ‘ring-fence’ to separate commercial from investment banking, and the leverage ratio. A situation in which taxpayers again bear the burden when banks fail is 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  unacceptable. That implicit guarantee is costly and distorts competition. The United Kingdom simply cannot afford to have an international banking centre if taxpayers have to underwrite a balance sheet that is many multiples of GDP. Too important to fail is too important to ignore. The economics of banking is changing, and the City has an opportunity to adapt and lead the new forms of banking that will emerge. The strength of the City of London has always been based on two qualities: its ability to adapt to new circumstances, and its truly global perspective. That will stand us in good stead now. But the future of banking will depend not only on changes to leverage but also on a greater degree of responsibility by all involved: the leaders of our banks, regulators and consumers. We must restore trust in our banking system. Today’s substantial and authoritative Report from the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards is an important landmark in mapping the path to that goal. Changing the ethics and culture of banking is a precondition of restoring trust. As the Commission’s Report shows, the sheer size and complexity of global banks have led to failures of governance. Governments, regulators, prosecutors and non-executive directors have all struggled to come to terms with firms that pose a risk to taxpayers, cannot be prosecuted because of their systemic importance, and are difficult to manage because of their size and complexity. It is not in our national interest to have banks that are too big to fail, too big to jail, or simply too big. Solving these problems is the work of a generation, and I hope that the financial community will rise to this challenge and not shrink from it. The City as a whole does merit trust. And, when the historians look back on this period many years from now, they will conclude that although we were not wiser than the financiers of the past, we did learn and we reformed, and the country benefitted and prospered as a result. As I leave the scene, there is undoubtedly much unfinished business for my successor. I am delighted that Mark Carney will be the next Governor. He brings a new generation of leadership to the Bank, as well as enormous experience from his time as a central bank governor and his role in steering the Financial Stability Board. He has my wholehearted best wishes for his term as Governor. Mark is, however, not the first Canadian to have been in the frame for the Governorship of the Bank of England. The very first Governor of the Bank of Canada, Graham Towers, was put forward by Keynes as a successor to Montagu Norman. The proposed transfer fell through – apparently the Directors of the Bank viewed the Canadian as ‘too Keynesian’. What that tells us about his views on monetary activism I do not know. But it is perhaps worth noting that Towers’ first Deputy Governor was a Mr. Osborne, who agreed to move to Canada from the Bank of England for a spell of ‘up to 5 years’. Sadly, the partnership between the Canadian Governor and Mr. Osborne lasted only three years, before the latter departed. But, Chancellor, remember that history doesn’t always repeat itself. In Britain, and especially in the City, we have always welcomed talent from around the world in academic, business, artistic and sporting life. Why should central banking be different? George, you are to be congratulated on Mark’s appointment. I shall of course be sad to leave. But Governors come and Governors go – it is institutions, and the ideas they embody, that matter more. I leave behind a strong, independent, much-changed Bank now focused on its two main responsibilities. The lessons of recent years have been learnt and it is up to us all to remember them. The test of our monetary arrangements is to see them work successfully under new leadership, none of whom were present at the creation. No doubt some things will change. No doubt some things need to change. After all one does not change an institution in order to set it in concrete. A successful institution, just like the City as a whole, always adapts to new circumstances. I know the Bank will continue to do just that under Mark’s leadership. Mark inherits a wealth of young talent in the Bank, led by three outstanding Deputy Governors: Charlie Bean, Andrew 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Bailey and, of course, Paul Tucker, who has made an enormous contribution to the Bank over three decades. The Bank of England is in safe hands, and the country will be the better for it. Lord Mayor, the wheel may have come off your carriage at last year’s installation, but then we saw your characteristic ability to turn every situation to advantage as you returned in triumph to Mansion House in a Land Rover. As the City too faces the challenge of turning disaster into triumph, it would do well to follow your example of how to “treat those two imposters just the same”. Roger, your commitment to the promotion of the creative industries – crucial to this, the most exciting city in the world – as well as opportunities for children, aspiring musicians, even trees and bicycles, is well known. And all of us here tonight would like to pay tribute to you Lord Mayor, and to thank the Lady Mayoress, Clare, and yourself, Roger, for the splendid hospitality which you’ve extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to “The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress, Roger and Clare Gifford”.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardian Fullani: The financial future of the region Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the summit of finance ministers and governors “The financial future of the region”, Becici, Montenegro, 14 June 2013. *      *      * Dear Ministers of Finance, Dear Governors, The crisis we are going through, being so profound and lasting, will leave its mark on economics in general, and central banking in particular. Up until the Great Recession, monetary policy was living in a world that we may call “the inflation targeting era”. To anyone that has followed the discussions regarding the optimal central bank policy ever since the onset of the crisis, it is clear that the validity of the previous approach has been heavily questioned. In many ways inflation targeting made the central bank’s job simple, as long as it followed the policy correctly. The Central Bank, seen by the public as an independent institution, had to credibly commit to an explicit inflation target, in order to anchor mid-term inflation expectations. Self-fulfilling expectations from economic agents and price setters would, in turn, help deliver the objectives of monetary policy. Unfortunately, as shown recently, this strict approach to monetary policy has some shortcomings. What this approach missed, due to its focus in consumer prices, was the drift in prices of assets in general. Escalating asset prices and their sudden burst affected significantly the behaviour and balance sheets of the economic agents and challenged the stability of the financial system. In this respect, the concept of financial stability was seen as a by product of monetary stability. Economists believed that by stabilizing consumer prices, financial assets would also behave in a stable and predictable way. The crisis painfully reminds us that: this is not necessarily true. Behaviour in financial markets is not always rational and lack of confidence in the markets can spiral out of control, sending shockwaves throughout the economy. Fortunately, the Bank of Albania adopted a more conservative approach considering monetary policy and financial stability issues simultaneously, conditioning either decision-making process by the other one. Due to this behaviour, the crisis had a direct but trivial impact on the financial system. Despite this, the banking system faced immediate difficulties in the form of deposit withdrawals, emerging as indirect effects of fear contagion and irrational expectations. The liquidity problems that emerged spilled over to the credit market and later to the real economy and foreign sector. The Bank of Albania reacted quickly to this changing economic climate. Liquidity was abundantly injected to our banks and more stringent regulations were applied in regard to the transfer of funds. However, unlike in most other countries where monetary policy was used initially to boost aggregate demand, in Albania, monetary policy stayed in its course giving way to expansionary fiscal policy. Due to a relatively long period of consolidation, fiscal policy at the outburst of crises had abundant room for manoeuvre and has a more direct impact on the economy. Our policy response was conditioned by the concerns of financial stability, assuming that interest rate cuts would speed up deposit withdrawals from the banking system. Bank of Albania took bold and decisive steps to control these problems and restore the credibility in banking system. As the effects of the fiscal stimulus began to phase out and 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  confidence was restored in the banking system, we reduced our policy rate to its historic low in order to provide further stimulus for the economy. More importantly, our supervision of the banking system has been enhanced by establishing a thoroughly new Department of Financial Stability and by bringing financial stability issues in the decision-making process of monetary policy. As a result, the set of tools available to the Bank of Albania has extended to include several macro-prudential measures, which aim to address simultaneously both economic growth and financial stability concerns. I believe that similar steps have been taken by most central banks around the world. Willingly or not, the objective of financial stability is now seen as the central duty of our institutions. It does not matter whether the legal mandate of the central bank is amended to include this new objective or not. What matters is that financial stability is a prerequisite to overall macroeconomic stability and monetary stability. The challenge that lies ahead of us is how to include this new objective in our policy making; whether inflation targeting and financial stability can be combined or whether a new regime altogether is needed. Various new radical approaches have been mentioned so far. However, I believe that we should not discard all the hard-learned lessons and the successes of the past. Stabilizing inflation should be something that central bankers may be proud of, something that we should cherish and continue to strive for. Incorporating financial stability objectives with the inflation targeting regime should be seen as an opportunity to understand economic developments and potential macro-financial risks, to achieve both these objectives and preserve long-run economic stability. I believe the course of the monetary policy will continue to be extensively discussed in the future, including our improved understanding of the role of asset prices and financial frictions.  Under the current conditions, the largest central banks in developed countries have stretched central banking theory and practice beyond traditional activities. Their balance sheets have increased beyond imagination and, in some cases, include private assets; they have accepted a much broader role and have assumed more responsibility. This all new and untested type of central banking will have a strong impact not only on the nature of monetary policy and its interaction with other central bank objectives but also on the independence and credibility of the central bank itself. The nature of future monetary policy will largely depend on the success of the largest central banks to get out of this situation in a controlled and timely manner, without causing excess inflation and damaging central banks hard-earned credibility. These developments will affect monetary policy in the emerging markets through interest and exchange rates, but most importantly in the way central banks conduct their monetary policy. Influenced by current practices of leading central banks, some other central banks have reoriented their objectives and engaged in activities which are traditional for development banks and governments. We have been careful to stay away from adopting and targeting such objectives not only in monetary policy but also in our macro-prudential policy. The Bank of Albania has traditionally based its policy on two important pillars. Our first focus has been to achieve our inflation target and manage inflation expectations to preserve the purchasing power of our currency. This policy has simultaneously provided necessary stimulus to economic activity. Second, our focus on banking supervision and financial stability has enhanced the confidence on our financial system and therefore increased the efficiency and credibility of our monetary policy. As I have said in April of 2008, during the annual conference with the banking system in Albania, “every investment we make today in financial stability yields increased efficiency in our monetary policy”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Recently, the Bank of Albania has introduced financial literacy as a third pillar of our policy and independence. This objective is founded on my belief that the first two pillars gain sustainability only if the public understand the role of the central bank, its independence and its policy. Last but equally important, I would like to emphasise the need of cooperation and coordination with the fiscal policy. Fiscal policy and its impact are facts of life which can’t be ignored. Therefore, monetary and macro-prudential policies have to be designed and implemented in full awareness of its existence. A Central Bank does not live in an isolated island; its success will, among others, depend on its ability to act in coordination and cooperation with the fiscal policy, without losing its independence. Incorporating this understanding in the central bank theory and practice requires some adjustments and flexibility but, at the same time, requires that central banks preserve their focus and independence and acknowledge their limitations. Altogether these changes will allow the central bank and its inflation targeting regime to become a useful tool at the hand of the monetary authorities to preserve economic and financial stability in the post-Global Financial Crisis period. Thank you very much for your attention!  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardian Fullani: EU integration – key challenges for CESEE countries Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the conference “Interlinkages with the euro area and long-term convergence dynamics”, hosted by the European Central Bank, Frankfurt, 17 June 2013. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentleman, Dear Colleagues, The topic of this Conference is of crucial importance for the economic and financial prospects of Western Balkan countries. These countries are fully integrated with the EU economy and the EU financial system. The European Union represents their main trading partner and banks originating in the EU dominate the financial system in our region. As amply demonstrated by our experience, prior to and during the recent crisis, developments in the EU affect immediately both the real and the financial system in the region. The EU and Western Balkans can be considered partners and, as such, they have a legitimate interest in the policies and actions of the other. I trust this conference will try to explore the best mechanisms for mutual consultation and coordination. CESEE countries have chosen integration with the EU as the main vehicle to deliver sustainable and long-term economic prosperity to their citizens. I would like to point out that our countries have consciously chosen the path of EU integration: we have undertaken painful structural reforms; we have made legal and regulatory reforms around this process; we have opened our markets to goods, services and capital from the EU. I think it is only fair for us to expect long-term commitment and solidarity from our partners. This integration and convergence process has certainly delivered in the past two decades. GDP growth has outpaced that of the EU and financial intermediation has rapidly improved. Common economic wisdom based on indicators such as GDP per capita, relative financial intermediation, relative cost of labour and technology indicate that this process will continue in the future. CESEE countries still offer attractive investment opportunities: they have, in general, better demographic dynamics and are geographically closer to Europe than other emerging markets. This political and economic integration has naturally led to financial integration. However, I would like to make three remarks regarding the economic and financial integration path we are pursuing. • First, the main focus of national authorities in SEE should be to facilitate the allocation of capital to more productive sectors, by providing the right incentives, structural reforms, legal environment, tax policies, and economic stability. This requires a common understanding with banks operating in the region. Banks are and will remain profit-maximizing entities. Nevertheless, they should be more attentive to long-term trends, because they have a stake in the sustainable development of the economy. • Second, we have developed a financial system and pursued a financial integration strategy based on the banks, which account for more than 90% of the financial system throughout the region. Therefore, recent suggestions about developing domestic capital markets as an alternative to a bank-based financial system are useful, but perhaps unfeasible in the short to medium term. • Third, the SEE is and will remain a capital-hungry region, which should be partly intermediated through international banks. This fact should be recognized by both 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  EU regulators and EU parent banks. A new business model relying purely on domestically-generated deposits is a wrong answer to the previous extremes of huge capital inflows. Currently, key challenges to financial stability in the SEE area comprise non-performing loans, slow growth of credit to the economy, the problem of fiscal finances, and the exchange rate stability. Their nature and magnitude are directly related to the growth problem and the private sector approach to consumption, savings and expectations. These problems were either created or exposed by the crisis and have exacerbated due to financial stability-related issues of our partner countries and their approach to the solution of such challenges. More directly, the banking sector has seen deleveraging due to required financial stability measures of the European banking authorities. Does this have an impact on credit and growth? The obvious answer is yes. Whether directly or indirectly and despite their origin, current financial stability problems are related to slow economic growth, which, in turn, is the result of shrinking financial intermediation. In principal, these developments have combined in a vicious circle, which is leading the economy in a slow downward spiral. There are certain important lessons learned by the crisis. Above all, there is a substantial change in the perception of policy design and policy implementation by authorities with two defining trends. First, we are observing a new paradigm – the rethinking of the central bank policy design and policy implementation. The new model consists first in the idea that CPI-based inflation targeting might not be enough to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability, and second, in the use of macroprudential regulation in combination with traditional monetary policy measures. To be effective, these measures require a strong coordination with traditional monetary policy and banking regulation and supervision measures. Unless coordinated, they can do more harm than good. Moreover, given the strong cross-border financial links between the EU and the SEE, they have over reaching effects across the borders. In this respect, coordination becomes a multi dimensional effort. Due to these strong financial and economic linkages of the CESEE with the euro area, European policies and regulations, macroeconomic and macro prudential intervention have authentic real-time impact on our economies giving way to new challenges. The coordination of macroeconomic and macroprudential measures within the euro area will continue to exert macro stability pressures on the CESEE. Therefore, it is important for the economies of the CESEE to know, in advance, and understand the EU’s legal, institutional and regulatory developments in the financial system and possibly have an opinion on the potential impact and unintended consequences that such developments may have on their economies. I would invite the EU monetary and supervisory authorities to focus on the overall picture and think about long-term solutions rather than short-term adjustments, which, instead of solving the problems, recycle the old ones (problems) into new challenges, transforming the nature and the subject without really addressing the overall stability issue. The EU Banking Union, in our view, is a very important step towards further integration and coordination between home and host authorities. We appreciate the fact that the establishment of the centralized supervisory authority will facilitate the information exchange between supervisors, creating a more efficient communication between home and host regulators by reducing the complexity of dealing with multiple national supervisors and regulatory bodies. The Bank of Albania, as a member of the Vienna Initiative Steering Committee, advocates the need for EU authorities to comprehensively assess interconnectedness issues between EU/euro area and non-EU/non-euro economies in order to design balanced and sustainable policies. In particular, macro prudential measures in the euro area should also consider the situation and the potential impact on non-EU host countries. We expect that the ECB, as a leading authority within the SSM, to play an important and constructive role, whereas non-EU supervisors must be granted the opportunity to express their views on EU financial policy decisions affecting their domestic financial stability, before the actual decisions are taken. The effective functioning of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  supervisory colleges is also considered a very important issue, where countries with systemic EU subsidiaries may address their supervisory concerns. On the other hand, it would help if small countries of the region outside the Banking Union had a unified view and approach towards EU authorities and expressed their concerns as a single voice. In this regard, the Bank of Albania, assuming a coordinating role, has invited other non-EU countries to contribute in formulating a common regional approach towards the Banking Union and its effects on these countries. We also argue that it is at the benefit of the ECB, and other monetary and supervisory authorities and EU authorities to bring the CESEE countries on board of discussions, like a responsible doctor, who, while providing a strong remedy for his patient, tries to minimize potential side effects. The ECB must consider the potential side effects of its policies in our region. This consideration concerns five important issues: First, the ECB has a large theoretic and empiric expertise on financial stability, monetary and economic analysis; however, the CESEE countries may have a more precise and direct view of potential side effects on their economies; Second, this discussion among the ECB and the CESEE must start early, possibly in the design process rather than after the implementation of legislation and regulation. This will allow enough time for CESEE authorities to implement legal and regulative amendments to complement EU regulation and adapt its institutional structures in timely manner. The reforming EU deposit insurance and banking resolution mechanisms, for example, will have legislative and regulative implications for economies of the CESEE due to dominance of European banking groups in our financial sectors. However, until the ECB and the EU decide on a solution and legislation is eventually approved, we would not know what the potential implications (like regulatory arbitrage opportunities), the required legal changes, and the financial costs are for our banking system and our economies. Information is clearly in the interest of the CESEE countries as it would remove uncertainty and risk among host supervisors (non-EU and non-euro area) regarding the effective resolution (including burden-sharing) of multinational European banks; Third, establishing “Resolution colleges”, similar to “colleges of supervisors”, might be an intelligent and efficient way to prepare for extreme situations. These colleges would allow home and host supervisors to discuss ex-ante regarding possible resolution of multinational European banks, with the purpose of bridging differences in the process and burden sharing as much as possible. In principle, some form of supervision could be designed to allow the ECB to share the responsibility of supervising multinational European banks with the host supervisors (particularly in case of their systemic importance in host countries). Fourth, establishing swap lines of liquidity in euro, between the ECB and the host countries’ central banks (or supervisory authorities) – non-EU countries, managing and overcoming unexpected liquidity risk and other potential constrains faced by multinational European banks, which might rise directly or as unintended consequences in response to decisions taken by supervision and financial stability authorities in the euro area. This could be the case only for those (non-euro area, non-EU) host countries, where the European banks have a systemic importance. In return, the host countries’ supervisors will provide the ECB with information on the financial situation of the systemic subsidiaries and their respective supervisory policies; Fifth, it is about the role of international financial organizations. The IMF, the World Bank, and the Basel Committee have had and continue to play an important role in shaping the financial system and building its resilience in our economies. The EFSAP is an excellent example to illustrate this point, and they have vast expertise in dealing with related issues in developed and emerging countries. Therefore, I believe that involvement of these institutions in the discussion process would benefit both EU and CESEE economies. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The euro area and the CESEE economies will be ultimately part of the same political economic and monetary union. Despite current hardships, the EU political and economic integration agenda remains committed in this goal. One might even say that despite potential political, social setbacks caused by the crisis, it (the crisis) is pushing the integration agenda faster and stronger than before. In this respect, it is necessary to connect the political and economic integration process together and continue developing both processes at the same speed. Under current circumstances, regional cooperation and communication becomes a necessary objective of the CESEE integration process, at least for the banking and financial market reform. It would be much easier for the EU authorities to adopt and address the concerns of the CESEE as a single group rather than individually. In conclusion, it is so important to establish a significant level of communication and coordination among the central banks and EU institutions, their legal and regulative framework. Finally, I would recommend complementing it with a similar level of coordination among other institutions, which play a significant role in macroeconomic and financial stability in our economies. In particular, there is more need for communication and coordination among the ministers of finance in the region because fiscal policy is essential for the macrofinancial stability of the economy and plays a significant role in the successful implementation of the macroprudential tools. The coordination is not an easy task, especially when benefits come at the cost of one’s partners, but, if we aspire to have far-reaching results, this is the right manner and the appropriate moment to react. Thank you!  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Barry Whiteside: Brief comments on Fiji’s economy Opening address by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the launch of BSP Life’s new “Bula Elite” product, Suva, 13 June 2013. *      *      * Mr. Robin Fleming, Chief Executive Officer, BSP Group Mr. Kevin McCarthy, BSP Fiji Country Manager Mr. Malakai Naiyaga, Managing Director, BSP Life Limited Members of the Board, Management and Staff of BSP Life Limited and Bank South Pacific Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen Introductory comments Bula vinaka and a very good evening to you all! I am delighted to be here this evening at yet another key BSP event, this time to launch BSP Life’s new Bula Elite product. Thank you, Malakai, for your kind invitation. Since establishing its presence in Fiji, the BSP Group has elevated the standards of innovation for financial products and services in both banking and insurance, and has become a leading player in both industries. The launch of another Life product is a further endorsement of the success of the BSP Group and the key role it plays in Fiji’s financial system. We at the Reserve Bank are seeing the flow-on effects of such business success in our domestic economy, through increased positive sentiments and actions by the private sector. Let me therefore make some comments on the economy. Economic update & outlook We all know that Fiji is a small OPEN economy – so what happens globally will generally find its way back to us in one form or the other. While global growth is trending upwards, it is really being pulled along by growth in the major emerging economies (or the BRICS as we refer to them). In contrast, slowdowns are forecast for most of our trading partners in 2013, with much of the Eurozone in recession and having been there for the last 4 to 6 quarters. But all this has not dampened our own recent domestic output and the forecasts we have set for the near term. On the domestic front, GDP growth this year is forecast at 2.7 percent, a little improvement on the 2.5 estimated for 2012. An important takeaway is that our growth is broad- based with almost all sectors making a positive contribution. In 2013, growth is being led by agriculture, manufacturing, the finance and construction sectors. While we know that investment is the “driver” of growth, it is the Private Sector that is the recognized “engine”. This, however, was clearly not the case in 2010 when the private sector contributed just 3.5 percent to the overall 13.5 percent Investment-to-GDP number. I am pleased to say that we have seen a turnaround through 2012 and now into 2013. Our indicators are showing high growth, led by greater lending by financial institutions for investment purposes as well as strength in building and construction activity. Look around you when you are travelling through Suva and other areas on Viti Levu and you will see the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  evidence. Talk to business people and they exude more positive vibes. Our own Business Expectations Survey, where we survey 243 businesses on a semi-annual basis, is reflective of this. This year, the Investment-to-GDP ratio will be around 25 percent, of which the private sector’s share is forecast at 13 percent. Clearly this is a vote of confidence by the private sector in the Fijian economy. Through all this our foreign reserves have been holding steady and are currently at $1.62 billion (worth the equivalent of around 4.7 months of imports), while inflation was 1.5 percent at the end of May. The challenge moving forward is to keep this positive momentum going – and, on Government’s part, to ensure its Reform programmes gain ground, and that the deadlines to Parliamentary elections continue to be met. The BSP Fiji Group Let me come back to why we are here this evening. It is evident that the BSP Group has lifted the game in banking services, and I am assured it will continue to be at the forefront of product and technology innovation as it grows its presence in Fiji. It is most pleasing to see that, so far, the profits it has made here are being ploughed back into the country in raising that presence. From a product innovation standpoint, Bank South Pacific has been a market leader in providing access points of financial services. I understand it now has the largest ATM network and the second largest number of EFTPOS machines. It was also the first to introduce SMS banking here. The Bank’s website also provides 24- hour on-line banking services, 7 days of the week. On the insurance business, BSP Life, as a brand, has been in the market for just over two years, having taken over from Colonial Life. The Company has, however, achieved significant success in a short period of time. I would like to highlight some of these major accomplishments:  • The enhancement to its life product offering through the launch of the Bula Prime product in 2011. • The re-branding of Dominion House to BSP Life Centre, which now accommodates all of BSP Life’s operations. • The opening of a new Customer Services centre on the ground floor of BSP Life Centre. I am told that walk-in customers are averaging 2,000 per week, double what they were before the office opened. • The opening of a Lautoka office, to complement the Nadi branch and to provide greater service to customers in the West. • The rollout of new medical products earlier this year, including the introduction of an India Evacuation product at very affordable premiums. I understand that BSP Life has partnered with the world renowned Apollo chain in India which provides a broad range of specialist medical services. Access to India is now seamless via Hong Kong or Seoul and the quality of services at Apollo, I am told, is world class. In 2012 Apollo treated over 60,000 international patients at their Delhi facility alone. I think these numbers provide some indication of the acknowledgement of the quality of the treatment available. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  • In so far as investments go, the BSP Life portfolio has grown to $323 million. Most of this money is invested in Fiji, helping to provide employment for our people and helping to grow our economy. • I also note the strong financial standing of the business as publicly declared in the Company’s recent Key Disclosure Statement for 2012. This augurs well for future growth and ongoing returns to BSP Life policy holders. I am pleased to note a significant investment in marketing by the BSP Group to create awareness of the need to invest and protect our financial future. With the take-up of life insurance at less than 15 percent of our population, BSP Life has taken a lead role in creating awareness of the critical need for us to have insurance and protect our loved ones. BSP Life and BSP Bank have also been key partners, along with other stakeholders, in the Reserve Bank of Fiji’s ongoing efforts to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy in Fiji. Launch of Bula Elite and concluding remarks Ladies and Gentlemen, it is clear that BSP Life has strongly established itself in life and health insurance in the Fiji market over such a short period of time. Tonight is another special milestone in the Company’s growth as a major player in Fiji’s insurance industry. I understand that the Bula Elite product has been developed following extensive market research and is designed to provide exceptional value for clients. It is an insurance product that will meet both short and long term investment needs whilst simultaneously providing peace of mind with insurance protection for loved ones. This is again a testament to BSP Life’s focus where products and services are developed to provide strong value for customers. I wish you, Malakai, and your team, the very best with the rollout of this new product. Without further ado, it is my pleasure to officially launch BSP Life’s latest product, Bula Elite. Vinaka vakalevu.   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Opening remarks at the session “Rethinking the limitations of monetary policy” Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the farewell conference honouring Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, Jerusalem 18 June 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, The topic for this session – “the limitations of monetary policy” – is one that has attracted a great deal of attention since the beginning of the financial crisis. Circumstances have forced all major central banks to resort to instruments and policies carefully tailored to the unusual situation. Alex Cukierman and Michael Woodford, who will present their views on the issue in a few minutes, are among the prominent academics that have written about it extensively1. Before handing the floor to them, let me say a few words about the current situation in the euro area, about our perspective at the European Central Bank (ECB) on today’s topic and about longer-term issues for the euro area. In terms of the current situation, the euro area economy is still in a phase of adjustment. Real GDP fell by 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2013. Output has thus declined for six consecutive quarters, labour market conditions remain weak and public and private sector balance sheet adjustments continue to weigh on economic activity. Unacceptably high levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, are the prime concern of economic policy-makers. Recent survey data suggest some improvement, but from low levels. Export growth should benefit from a recovery in global demand. Domestic demand should be supported by accommodative monetary policy; by the recent real income gains from lower oil prices and lower inflation; and by the confidence and wealth effects stemming from the improvements in financial markets since last summer. The ECB’s Governing Council has stressed that that monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. In the period ahead, we will monitor very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and stand ready to act if necessary. In the meantime, it is important to note that economic and financial fragmentation in the euro area has declined significantly since last summer. This has had beneficial effects for the real economies of all euro area countries. Banks in stressed countries have been able to regain access to interbank and capital markets – and they have raised funds as well as capital. Larger corporations have benefited from lower borrowing costs in capital markets. And small and medium-sized enterprises have seen borrowing costs from banks somewhat reduced. All of this should support investment. Target balances, which provide a powerful summary indicator of fragmentation, have declined by almost 300 billion euros or 25% from their peak. The costs of protection against                                                 1  See, for example, Cukierman, A., 2013, Monetary policy and institutions before, during, and after the global financial crisis, Journal of Financial Stability, in press, and Cúrdia, V. and Woodford, M., 2011, The central-bank balance sheet as an instrument of monetary policy, Journal of Monetary Economics, 58(1), 54–79. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  risks of deflation have fallen from peaks twice their long-term average last summer to slightly below average now2. Overall, monetary policy has regained steering capacity, which had become lost for large parts of the euro area in mid-2012. This is an important positive development. Let me turn now to the limitations of monetary policy. Here I see two possible dimensions. The first is positive and refers to the effectiveness of central bank actions at the margin – for example, when interest rates are close to zero. The second is normative and refers to the constraints imposed on us by our mandate and to the fears that boundaries between central bank policies and other policies might become blurred. I will not dwell on the first dimension because I do not think that we are materially challenged in our ability to deliver our objective of price stability by the low level of interest rates. Looking back, despite extraordinarily testing economic circumstances, inflation in the euro area has remained on the whole consistent with the ECB’s objective of below but close to 2%. Looking forward, Eurosystem staff project annual HICP inflation at 1.4% in 2013 and 1.3% in 2014, but medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored in line with our definition of price stability. One reason why inflation expectations have remained broadly stable is that we – and other major central banks around the world – have prevented the materialisation of deflation risk by adopting both standard and non-standard measures as and when necessary. In the euro area, one such non-standard measure was the introduction of the outright monetary transactions (OMT) programme last year, the stabilising effects of which are widely recognised. There are numerous other measures – standard interest rate policy and non-standard measures – that we can deploy and that we will deploy if circumstances warrant. At the same time, I have also made clear that some of those measures may have unintended consequences. This does not mean that they should not be used, but it does mean that we need to be aware of those consequences and manage them appropriately. We will look with an open mind at these measures that are especially effective in our institutional setup and that fall within our mandate. This leads me to the second dimension of discussion of the limitations of monetary policy, namely the risk of a blurring of the boundaries of central bank policy. To approach this question, it is useful to refer to the framework put forward by another prominent scholar in central bank matters. Marvin Goodfriend classifies central bank actions into three categories3. The first category is what he calls “monetary policy” proper – changes in the size of the monetary base via purchases and sales of government securities. Second comes “credit policy” – changes in the composition of the central bank’s assets between government securities and claims on the private sector of various kinds.                                                 2  See P. Praet, Monetary policy in the context of balance sheet adjustments, Speech at Peterson Institute for International Economics, 22 May 2013. 3  See Goodfriend, M., 2011, Central banking in the credit turmoil: an assessment of Federal Reserve practice, Journal of Monetary Economics, 58(1), 1–12. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Third is “interest on reserves policy” – changes in the opportunity cost for banks to hold reserves or excess reserves. Goodfriend argues that all three categories have fiscal implications. And he states that credit policy and interest on reserve policy involve the use of public funds in a way that may imply an allocative role – and which may therefore blur the respective roles of the monetary and fiscal authorities. In this context, it is worth recalling that the monetary constitution of the ECB is firmly grounded in the principles of ‘ordoliberalism’, particularly two of its central tenets: • First, a clear separation of power and objectives between authorities; • And second, adherence to the principles of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources. More explicitly, and by reference to another famous framework – the three basic policy functions that Richard Musgrave described as allocation, stabilisation, and distribution, and which aim delivering what Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa later described as efficiency, stability and equity – our policy is concerned only with macroeconomic stabilisation through the pursuit of price stability. We do not and should not play an active role in the functions of allocation and distribution4. At the same time, our operational framework has always included elements of what Goodfriend qualifies as credit policy. The ECB manages liquidity and steers money market rates by lending to banks in temporary credit operations against a broad range of collateral. Furthermore, we have always remunerated reserves. Does the fact that our operations entail some credit risk on the balance sheet of the central bank imply a violation of our ordoliberal principles? Does it imply that the ECB policy interferes with credit allocation? My answer is no. The risks we take onto our balance sheet in the context of our operations are controlled, and they are accepted only insofar as they are strictly necessary for the pursuit of price stability. This is entirely consistent with the concept of monetary dominance, which stipulates that fiscal considerations cannot stand in the way of the achievement of price stability. Indeed, ECB credit is backed by adequate collateral, which implies that the amount of residual risk borne by the central bank is buffered. There are two layers of protection. The first is founded on the ECB’s recourse to the borrowing institutions and the full credit and guarantee represented by their balance sheets. The second – when the first is exhausted – is given by the appropriation of the collateral posted as backing of the loan. If a counterparty defaults, the underlying collateral assets allow for the recovery of the amount lent. The use of risk control measures such as valuation haircuts and variable margins further mitigate the exposure to credit risk. The same risk control principle applies in the context of the OMT programme, through limitations on the maturity of eligible securities (one to three years) and through the strict conditionality for a country to be eligible for the programme. Another aspect of our operations is that they are designed precisely with the goal of achieving neutrality in credit allocation.                                                 4  Having said that, the objective of monetary policy being stabilisation does not imply that it cannot contribute to efficiency and equity, and indeed stable prices are a precondition of both (see B. Coeuré, Monetary Policy in a fragmented world”, Speech at Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Vienna, 10 June 2013. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The ECB’s policy framework was designed with a view to allowing the participation of a broad range of counterparties. The framework rests on the fundamental principle of equal treatment of counterparties. Equal treatment is also reflected in the collateral framework, which features a broad range of assets and a set of eligibility criteria that apply to all Eurosystem credit operations without distinction. A further observation is that lending to banks is consistent with an untargeted monetary policy. In the euro area, the majority of credit intermediation is processed via the banking system, as opposed to financial markets. Banks lend to households and to financial and non-financial firms of any size across the credit spectrum. Influencing bank funding conditions amounts to influencing credit conditions across the whole economy. What I have said applies in normal times, but it also largely applies in the specific circumstances of a fragmentation of the financial system – circumstances that we have faced and continue to face, albeit to a diminishing extent. Financial fragmentation in itself creates a distortion of the allocation of resources. It undermines the concept of a free market economy because it alters the conditions of competition. In this context, the measures that we have implemented through the crisis do not have an allocative or distributive role. On the contrary, by supplementing financial intermediation where it had become dysfunctional, they have contributed to re-establishing the allocative and distributive neutrality of markets. The liquidity measures that we took early in the crisis can be interpreted in this light. At that time, central banks had to substitute for the sudden disappearance of interbank market activity by acting themselves as a money market intermediary when necessary. For the ECB, this task was facilitated by the wide range of counterparties accepted in refinancing operations and by our broad collateral framework. Other central banks had to innovate more through the use of various targeted facilities outside their normal operating framework in order to reach out to the broad economy. The ECB could also mobilise its collateral framework to relieve the liquidity constraints faced by banks. We expanded the list of eligible collateral, so that banks could liquefy their balance sheets and mobilise assets that had become difficult to trade. In addition, the ECB could further contribute to alleviating the banks’ funding uncertainty by providing banks with assurance that they could rely on our refinancing operations for extended periods. The maximum maturity of our operations increased from three months to three years. Through these measures, the ECB decisively addressed the liquidity pressures faced by euro area banks and avoided a genuine credit crunch. Professor Fischer, Ladies and gentlemen, What must be clear from what I have said so far is what constitutes the limitations to our actions, consistent both with the letter of our mandate and with the philosophy of the market economy that underpins it. We have been able to regain better control of monetary conditions in the euro area economy, which is very important for providing the appropriate monetary policy impulse to the economy. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Part of this achievement is due to the announcement of the OMT programme. But equally important has been the progress in economic reform and adjustment at both the country level and the euro area level. Such reforms need to continue. There is still a rich reform agenda, especially structural, at the country level for many members of the euro area. There is also an important reform agenda at the European level. One key aspect of that is the banking union, which rests on single supervision and single resolution, the latter with an effective backstop if necessary. Preparations for single supervision at the ECB are advancing, and naturally we are working closely with the relevant national authorities. Five work streams are underway: first, on mapping the euro area banking system to identify systemically important banks; second, on the supervisory model to be adopted, which is most likely to be centred around joint supervisory teams; third, on supervisory data reporting; fourth on legal issues; and fifth, on the asset quality review that we will undertake prior to taking any bank under supervision. Formal adoption of the legal texts by the European Parliament will allow us to formalise the preparations and launch them so that we can be operational one year after adoption. Effective supervision requires effective resolution, which in turn requires establishment of a single resolution mechanism. We count on the European Commission to make a proposal in due course. Once these processes are launched, the banking union will be within operational reach. It should provide an answer to many of the challenges currently facing the euro area, including uneven credit conditions and the fragmentation of financial markets. When observers from outside look at our Economic and Monetary Union, they often emphasise how unfinished it appears compared with fully established unions such as the United States. In so doing, they highlight a number of unresolved issues, for example that in a monetary union of 17 otherwise sovereign states, a credit or transfer across Member States is viewed differently from a credit or transfer within an individual Member State. The equivalent of Target balances, for example, is a non-issue in the United States. However, such observers vastly underestimate the political capital invested in the euro by our leaders, as well as the political significance that such an investment has for the future of Europe. Of course, much work remains to be done for economic policy-makers across Europe. But I am confident that together we can build a stronger economic and monetary union that ultimately delivers jobs, growth and a return to prosperity for the citizens of the euro area. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: The role of central banks Opening statement by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, to the panel discussion at the AICGS (American Institute for Contemporary German Studies) Panel, Berlin, 12 June 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen  The events of the past five years have called into question many assumptions that were the foundations of our monetary and financial system.  But while it is necessary to draw the right conclusions from the current crisis, we should not discard the lessons we have learned from previous crises – for they remain equally valid. The cautious role of central banks in spurring economic growth is such a lesson – a lesson we learned the hard way in the 70s and 80s. Some central banks tried to foster economic growth by reducing interest rates considerably – even at the price of significantly higher inflation rates.  In contrast, inflation rates in countries with independent central banks focused on delivering price stability were comparatively low in these years. While average inflation in Germany stood at 3.4%, it reached 8.2% in France, 12.5 % in Italy and 12.4% in Spain. The important point here is that lower inflation did not come at the expense of lower growth. It turned out that quite the opposite is true – the best contribution to sustainable growth a central bank can make is to keep prices stable.  But stable prices are not the only prerequisite for growth. A stable financial system is also crucial – this is the lesson of the financial crisis. It is of utmost importance to restore and preserve confidence in the resilience of the financial system as a whole. In this process, central banks play an important role, especially when it comes to mitigating systemic risks, nowadays known as macro-prudential regulation and supervision. In keeping prices stable and contributing to a stable financial system, central banks can put in place the conditions for sustainable growth. But they cannot deliver this growth on their own. All measures the Eurosystem has taken to contain the fallout of the crisis, like the ECB Governing Council reduced interest rates to a mere 50 basis points, decided to provide banks with quasi unlimited liquidity, and to intervene in bond markets only helped to stabilise output in the short term. The fundamental problems of the euro area are structural in nature. As such, they require a structural solution.  Precarious public finances and a lack of competitiveness are at the root of the current crisis. In some parts of the euro area, these problems are compounded by a very restrictive credit supply of banks. These challenges cannot be overcome by monetary policy. All that central banks can do is to buy time – time for governments and parliaments to consolidate budgets, improve the functioning of product and labour markets and recapitalize banks.  In safeguarding monetary and financial stability, central banks can pave the way for growth. But to actually get there, governments and parliaments must go down the route of implementing the required reforms.   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Responsible leadership in times of crisis Address by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of receiving the ESMT (European School of Management and Technology) Leadership Award 2013, Berlin, 13 June 2013. *      *      * Good afternoon. It is a great honour to receive this award for Responsible Leadership and I would like to thank Mario Monti for his kind introductory words. I regret that I am not able to join you in person today in Berlin but am pleased I can address you via Video. The fact we have a single currency and a European Central Bank is itself testament to the role of leadership. Many of you are too young to remember, but those of us who can recall Europe 20 years ago know how unimaginable it once was to speak about a single currency. Today, it is an integral part of our lives. But as this award reminds us, the key aspect of leadership is responsibility. In the words of Peter Drucker, “rank does not confer privilege or give power. It imposes responsibility”. As you know, the primary responsibility of the ECB is to maintain price stability in the euro area – to secure the value of our common currency. We take this responsibility with the utmost seriousness as it directly affects the lives of 330 million citizens of the euro area. Since the launch of the euro in 1999, we have fulfilled our mandate even through difficult times. We will continue to fulfil this task. I am very proud to be personally contributing to the historic project that the euro represents as the most tangible sign of European integration. But this pride is accompanied by a deep feeling of responsibility. There is no doubt that the recent period of economic and financial turbulence has tested us in new ways. We have had to take new measures to fulfil our responsibility for price stability. We had to look at all the data, assess all the evidence, and decide what measures were necessary to ensure the stability of the euro. One such decision was to combat market fragmentation by Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), based on a country committing itself to strict and effective conditionality under an EU/IMF economic adjustment programme. At almost one year from its announcement, the benefits of OMT are visible to everybody: Banks have been able to re-access the market, for both funding and for raising capital, and the strong divergence in funding costs across constituencies has receded. Deposits have flown back: banks in stressed countries have seen the deposits by the euro area money-holding sector increasing by about 200 billion euros since August 2012. Another sign of normalisation, and a very important one for German savers, has been the increase in German government bond yields, previously suppressed by panic-driven safe-haven flows, which have edged up by around 25 basis points. And Target balances, which are a summary indicator of fragmentation, have declined by 285 billion euros, or 25%, since the peak last year, and now are at the same level as in late-2011. Therefore, also perceived risks for creditor countries such as Germany have greatly diminished. The establishment of OMT has therefore been beneficial to everybody: sovereigns, corporations, banks as well as individuals, and it has benefited both periphery and core countries. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The decision on OMT was necessary. It was effective. And it was in line with our mandate. It was necessary to remove severe obstacles to the appropriate transmission of monetary policy that were putting the singleness of our monetary policy at risk and which were harming the economy of the euro area very deeply. And it is fully in line with our mandate because it is designed to preserve price stability for the euro area and uses instruments foreseen in the Statute. In short, for the ECB responsible leadership has meant being true to our founding Treaty. Staying independent from the voices calling for us to “do more” or to “do less”; staying fully focused on our mandate to secure price stability for the citizens of the euro area. For the euro area to now move forward and establish itself on stronger ground, we need all decision-makers to take their responsibilities. Governments to put right their public finances and address the structural challenges to growth in their economies; and the euro area as a whole to build a stronger economic and monetary union based on shared sovereignty and greater legitimacy. There is a great deal of work ahead of us. But I am sure we will succeed. Thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  William C Dudley: The national and regional economy Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York, 27 September 2013. *      *      * Good afternoon. I am pleased to be here today at Syracuse University. It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up our region, and it is especially gratifying to have the opportunity to speak with you, our future leaders. So thank you for inviting me. My meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy. Earlier on this trip, I met with government and business leaders in Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse to learn about some of the challenges the region faces as well as the collaborative efforts being taken to further economic development. The agenda for these visits is always packed, but that’s part of the point – to meet with a diverse array of representatives in order to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the region and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns. This is our fourth trip to Upstate New York in the past few years and recent trips have also taken us to Northern New Jersey, the boroughs of New York City, Long Island, and Fairfield County, Connecticut. My outreach trips complement the ongoing efforts of the New York Fed to assess conditions in the upstate New York economy and throughout our District. We monitor economic performance on a monthly basis through our indexes of economic activity and our survey of New York State manufacturers. We also get important input on economic conditions from meetings with our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members are major leaders in the upstate economy. We have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of homeowners and students, and conduct a bi-annual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability. The results of the latter have helped inform a series of clinics that we have conducted to help small businesses take the next step to access capital and identify new sources of funding. As I mentioned earlier, we are always eager to engage with students, and our commitment to our region includes a series of educational programs worth highlighting. First, Math x Economics, which encourages students attending Title 1 schools to consider preparing for a career in finance or economics. And, second, our yearly Fed Challenge competitions, in which teams of students from high schools and colleges in the District take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate what is the appropriate next step for U.S. monetary policy. All in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues fully engaged with the communities we represent. Next, I’ll review recent developments in the national and regional economy, and at the end of my talk will be happy to answer any questions you have about the economic outlook. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee. National economic conditions Let me begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment. Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which determines the timing of economic recessions and expansions, the current expansion began in mid-2009, more than four years ago. However, the expansion has been subdued so far, as the average annual growth rate of real GDP has been just 2.2 percent over the past four years. While that growth 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  rate is near most FOMC participants’ estimates of the U.S. economy’s longer-run growth rate as well as those of many outside analysts, a more rapid pace of growth likely is necessary to reduce meaningfully the significant economic slack that developed during the Great Recession. Consistent with the modest pace of economic growth, improvement in labor market conditions has been slow. Even though the unemployment rate has declined by 2.7 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, there are still many people that want jobs but are not counted as unemployed because they are not actively looking for work. An alternative measure of labor market conditions, the employment to population ratio, which is not influenced by changes in the number of these workers, has shown limited improvement. Job loss rates have fallen, but hiring rates remain depressed at low levels. Taken together, the labor market still cannot be regarded as healthy. Numerous indicators, including the behavior of labor compensation, are all consistent with the view that there remains a great deal of slack in labor markets. Nevertheless, as I have stated in earlier speeches, I see persuasive evidence of improving underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy. Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade. Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt. Banks have eased credit standards somewhat recently after a prolonged period of tightness. As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods. For example, light-weight motor vehicles sold at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of nearly 16.1 million in August, close to the number sold in 2007. Similarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade. Existing home sales remain on an upward trend, and a widely followed national home price index is up around 12 percent over the 12 months ending in July.1 Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a lack of homes for sale. However, a number of risks to the outlook are evident. Long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, have risen significantly since early May. Since then, we have seen a sharp drop in refinancing mortgage applications, a more moderate but significant decline in purchase mortgage applications and fairly flat housing starts and new home sales. Although I do not anticipate that the rise in long-term rates will lead to a downturn in housing, these developments do suggest that higher mortgage rates have cut into the upward momentum of the housing sector. We will need to monitor upcoming data closely to assess more fully the impact of higher rates on the housing recovery. Another risk is that federal fiscal policy could exert further restraint on the economy during the rest of this year and in 2014. It is difficult to assess how much of the contractionary effects from sequestration, for example, have already occurred, or still remain ahead. A related issue is the high degree of uncertainty about fiscal policy. In coming weeks, Congress will be considering how to fund the government for the next fiscal year and will also be debating what to do about the debt limit. This creates uncertainty about the fiscal outlook and may exert a restraining influence on household and business spending. One other risk to highlight is the global economic outlook. Even though the euro area appears to have begun to grow again after a protracted recession, growth in that area is still expected to be fairly weak at best. In addition, growth in many of the largest emerging economies has slowed, and some of the countries with large trade and current account                                                 1  Based on the CoreLogic home price index including distressed sales. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  imbalances have seen their financial markets and currencies come under pressure. If growth abroad were to slow, this could impede the growth of U.S. exports and this could result in less strength in manufacturing production and employment in the U.S. Thus, returning to an analogy I have used in previous speeches, I see the economy in a tug-of-war between these headwinds and underlying fundamental improvement, with a great deal of uncertainty over when the improvement in the underlying fundamentals will prevail. In the end, my best guess is that growth for all of 2013, measured on a Q4/Q4 basis, will be near the post-recession average. But I believe a good case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up some in 2014. The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag should subside. I also expect that, despite the near-term concerns, growth prospects among our major trading partners will improve next year. And this combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will strengthen. However, the notion that the economy will grow more swiftly remains a forecast rather than a reality at this point. Turning to the inflation outlook, total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has fluctuated recently with short-term movements in energy prices, but it continues to run below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent. Core inflation, that is, excluding food and energy, slowed in late 2012 and early 2013 to well below 2 percent, although it has shown signs of stabilizing in the last couple of months. A decomposition of core inflation reveals that the most recent slowing of inflation has been largely confined to core goods, whereas the rate of increase of core services has been relatively steady. Such was not the case in 2010 – the previous instance of a significant slowing of inflation. In addition, inflation expectations so far have remained relatively stable at levels somewhat above the current inflation rate. This should help prevent an undesirable further drop in inflation relative to our 2 percent objective. Thus, I anticipate that inflation will firm further in the months ahead and move toward the FOMC’s longer-run objective. Still, the FOMC recognizes that inflation persistently below 2 percent could pose risks to economic performance. As is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will be monitoring U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly in response to new information. So what does this all portend for monetary policy? As you are aware, at last week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee we made no changes to our monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided to continue purchasing long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at a monthly pace of $45 billion and $40 billion, respectively. The FOMC statement reaffirmed the Committee’s intention to “continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.”2  We also reaffirmed our forward guidance with respect to the federal funds rate. The statement notes that the Committee “decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6–1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”3                                                  2  Federal Open Market Committee statement, September 18, 2013. 3  Federal Open Market Committee statement, September 18, 2013. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  One noteworthy question that emerged following the meeting was why the Committee did not begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases. Although I can’t speak for the Committee, I can provide some reasons for my own decision. To begin to taper, I have two tests that must be passed: (1) evidence that the labor market has shown improvement, and (2) information about the economy’s forward momentum that makes me confident that labor market improvement will continue in the future. So far, I think we have made progress with respect to these metrics, but have not yet achieved success. With respect to the first metric, we have seen labor market improvement since the program began last September. Over this time period, the unemployment rate has declined to 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent. However, at the same time, this decline in the unemployment rate overstates the degree of improvement. Other metrics of labor market conditions, such as the hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate, quits rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate a much more modest improvement in labor market conditions compared to that suggested by the decline in the unemployment rate. In particular, it is still hard for those who are unemployed to find jobs. Currently, there are three unemployed workers per job opening, as opposed to an average of two during the period from 2003 to 2007. With respect to the second metric – confidence that the economic recovery is strong enough to generate sustained labor market improvement – I don’t think we have yet passed that test. The economy has not picked up forward momentum and a 2 percent growth rate – even if sustained – might not be sufficient to generate further improvement in labor market conditions. Moreover, as I noted earlier, fiscal uncertainties loom very large right now as Congress considers the issues of funding the government and raising the debt limit ceiling. Assuming no change in my assessment of the efficacy and costs associated with the purchase program, I’d like to see economic news that makes me more confident that we will see continued improvement in the labor market. Then I would feel comfortable that the time had come to cut the pace of asset purchases.4  Regional economic conditions Let me now turn to economic conditions in the region. The upstate New York economy is continuing to grow, but at a pace somewhat slower than the national economy. In part, this reflects the fact that the U.S. economy is recovering from a much deeper and more severe recession than Upstate New York. As the national economy continues to heal, places like Upstate New York, which didn’t see a huge boom and bust in housing and their economies before the Great Recession, don’t have as much ground to make up. But the region’s slow economic growth during the recovery also reflects the re-emergence of historical trends – Upstate New York hasn’t tended to perform as well as the rest of the country during economic expansions. Like many economies in the Northeast, Upstate has tended to grow slowly in recent decades, as the population has shifted to other parts of the country and the once dominant manufacturing industry has shrunk considerably. These same trends are playing out in the Syracuse area. Like Upstate New York more generally, the recession in Syracuse was not as deep as the nation’s. However, the Syracuse area experienced a deeper recession than Upstate as a whole, losing about 13,000 jobs during the downturn. The area’s recovery has lagged behind Upstate. So far, Syracuse has gained back less than half of the jobs that it lost. Recent job growth has been led by the region’s education and health sectors. Together, these sectors have added stability to the local economy and provided a foundation for growth. Over the past several years, during both recession and recovery, these sectors have added about 1,000 jobs each year to the local economy. The leisure and hospitality sector,                                                 4  For more thoughts on the monetary policy outlook, I refer you to the speech made earlier this week: Reflections on the Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  as well as the retail sector, has also been a solid source of job growth for the area. However, as you probably well know, job losses in the region’s manufacturing industry have weighed against these gains. About 9,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since the start of the Great Recession. And, while a slow jobs recovery began in the nation’s manufacturing sector in 2010, Syracuse has continued to lose these jobs in recent years – a painful process for the area to continue to endure to be sure. Nonetheless, these trends have resulted in a more diversified economy. In fact, the share of workers employed in the metro area’s manufacturing sector is now just 8 percent, just below the nation’s 9 percent share. The private education and health sectors have emerged as the largest industries, and now employ one in five workers. So, the face of the local economy has changed dramatically through a somewhat painful restructuring process. But I believe this process is reaching its conclusion, and the resulting more diversified local economy is providing a strong foundation on which Syracuse can build going forward. Hence my interest in the collaborative efforts of the business, academic and health sectors to further economic growth. These efforts capitalize on the strengths of the region and may well be a good way to further economic development not only in Syracuse but in Buffalo and Rochester as well. Each metro area has a strong university, a strong health sector and a business community all eager to find ways to leverage local assets and boost economic development. Looking forward, I believe that the colleges and universities in Syracuse will help drive the region’s economy in the years to come. Syracuse can build on these assets by continuing to make partnerships between industry and higher education a high priority. When companies and universities work together, they can become a powerful engine for innovation and economic growth. These collaborations are a key ingredient to helping improve the competitiveness of local businesses, the universities themselves, and their regions, and we should take every opportunity to exploit these partnerships as much as possible to unleash their full potential. College graduates finding jobs Let me finish off by saying a few words about the value of education. There is no doubt that the Great Recession and sluggish recovery that followed has made it difficult for many people to find jobs. I’m sure many of you here today are worried about finding a good job after you graduate, and you may be wondering whether going to college will turn out to have been a good investment. Let me reassure you, despite the weak labor market conditions that have prevailed since the Great Recession, the benefits of a college degree remain significant. Research we have undertaken at the New York Fed clearly shows that young people with a college degree are more likely to have a job and they tend to earn higher wages than those without degrees – and this is true even for those who may be underemployed initially when they first enter the labor market after graduation. In fact, our research finds that to some extent, it has always proved challenging for college graduates to transition into the labor market, even during economic expansions, but as time passes, and the graduate’s experience grows, the transition generally gets accomplished successfully. Although it is true that the labor market has been more difficult for college graduates in recent years, I am confident that most will find work and transition into higher-skilled jobs as they gain experience and as the labor market improves. Thank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Cœuré: The usefulness of forward guidance Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, before the Money Marketeers Club of New York, New York, 26 September 2013. *      *      * The slides referred to in the speech are available on the ECB website. I wish to thank Federic Holm-Hadulla and Arthur Saint-Guilhem for their contributions to these remarks. I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein. Ladies and Gentlemen, It’s a great pleasure to speak to you tonight.  I will use this opportunity to elaborate on the latest tool that central banks have adopted to deal with the macroeconomic consequences of the global financial crisis. This tool is forward guidance. What does forward guidance mean in a monetary policy context? Well, if you allow a brief definition, forward guidance can be described as explicit statements by a central bank about the likely path of future policy rates. These statements are typically conditioned – more or less explicitly – on the evolution of certain key macroeconomic aggregates.  Up until 1970s that central bank communication was based on secrecy and market surprise1. But central banks moved away from surprising markets and, instead, moved to open and transparent monetary policy making. Guidance on the future course of monetary policy was even common practice in some central banks before the crisis. For example, since 1997, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has included in its communication practice the release of the numerical projection of the future path of the policy rate. However, forward guidance as it was introduced during this crisis has been an unprecedented step for many central banks; both in terms of scope as well as clarity. I will argue that this recent initiative of central bank communication is a useful addition to the central bank toolkit. At a time of unprecedented challenges, it ensures that central banks do not only act with a steady hand but also speak with a steady voice. To set the stage, I will first give you my take on the design considerations surrounding forward guidance, including its rationale; the pros and cons of different types of forward guidance; and ways for measuring the effectiveness of forward guidance. Then, I will zoom in on the euro area and discuss the ECB’s forward guidance along these dimensions. Forward guidance: design considerations So what’s the purpose of forward guidance? Forward guidance aims to ensure that market expectations on future monetary policy are indeed consistent with the policy intentions of the respective central bank. Of course, a central bank’s communication should always provide reliable signals to markets that make their way through the yield curve to affect the financing conditions in the economy. Otherwise, monetary policy may, in itself, become a source of volatility, thus complicating the economic decisions of private actors – the exact opposite of what it should achieve.                                                 1 See Brunner (1981) and Goodfriend (1986). For an empirical evaluation see Cook and Hahn (1989). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  But the premium on clear communication is particularly large in extraordinary situations, for example when policy rates are at, or close to, their effective lower bound, or when the normal channels of monetary policy transmission are impaired, or when there is exceptional uncertainty on the state of the economy. Such situations occur only seldom. This makes it difficult for private agents to infer the future monetary policy path from past regularities. Hence, there is a clear added value in such a situation to making central bank communication more explicit. This explains why many central banks that had previously not used forward guidance adopted this tool in recent times.  How does forward guidance work? Well, first of all, most central banks have linked forward guidance to their main policy interest rates.  In implementing their monetary policy, central banks calibrate their main policy tools so as to establish a certain level of short term interest rates in the market. At the same time, expected future short term interest rates are a key ingredient for the determination of long term interest rates. Long term interest rates in turn are essential for saving, consumption and investment decisions, and ultimately for the development of prices and inflation in the economy.  Indeed, some recent papers on central bank communication provide clear evidence that central banks’ communication on their policy decisions and their assessment of the macroeconomic environment can have an important effect on long term interest rates.2 Through forward guidance – that is by providing more systematic guidance on the expected path of future policy rates – central banks can exert a stronger influence on market expectations of future short term interest rates. In fact, the central bank will have more direct leverage on broader financing conditions along a broader maturity spectrum. Some central banks have also attempted to influence the term structure at longer maturities more directly, for example by giving regular indications to markets on the future pace, composition and timing of their asset purchase programmes.  In any case, forward guidance is a means to establish consistency between the current policy measures and the long-term policy orientation. But for this to work, the content of the forward guidance has to reflect the central bank’s mandate. Only then will the central bank’s announcements be perceived as credible.  Let me explain this in more detail. From a conceptual perspective two types of forward guidance can be distinguished depending on the objective pursued3.  First, forward guidance can aim at merely providing greater transparency about policy intentions. This can entail two elements. The first element is to provide greater clarity about the central bank’s assessment of the economic outlook that is relevant for the assessment of medium term risks to price stability and further policy goals it may pursue. The second element is to provide more clarity on how the central bank will react to such outlook.  In certain cases, the market’s assessment of the economic outlook may clearly deviate from the central bank’s assessment. Moreover, even with a shared assessment of the outlook, the market may expect a systematically different policy response than pursued by the central bank. In these cases, forward guidance can help the central bank in clarifying its assessment of future economic conditions and its reaction function.                                                  2 See Brand et al. (2010), Gürkaynak et al. (2005), Kuttner and Posen (1999), Bibinger et al. (2013). 3 See Praet (2013) for a detailed exposition of this distinction. See also Campbell et al. (2012) for the taxonomy of “Odyssean” vs. “Delphic” forward guidance underlying this distinction. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  This can be especially valuable at times when upward volatility in financial markets risks creating risk premia along the yield curve, thereby inducing a premature withdrawal of monetary accommodation. Second, forward guidance can serve to communicate to market participants that the central bank’s policy intentions have changed.  Most notably, the central bank may try to convince markets that it would keep interest rates low, even if this would imply inflation well above its previous objective, at least temporarily. The promise of higher future inflation, if credible, induces private agents to substitute future for current consumption, hence providing additional stimulus today. This type of forward guidance is closer to the academic concept of forward guidance in the strict sense – as discussed, for example, in Woodford (2012). The main challenge of such guidance is its inherent inconsistency over time and thus lack of credibility. When the time comes, the central bank may be tempted to deviate from its prior commitment: once the benefits of higher inflation expectations in terms of front-loaded spending have been reaped, the central bank may not be willing to pay the bill in terms of higher inflation afterwards. If the public foresees this temptation, expectations might remain unaffected in the first instance and the desired inter-temporal substitution of spending might not materialise. This is a possible explanation why, in practice, central banks have refrained from using forward guidance in a way that implies a major change in strategy. Therefore, central banks’ forward guidance has rather aimed at providing greater clarity on the reaction function and the assessment of future economic conditions.  But forward guidance also faces challenges if it merely serves to clarify economic outlook and reaction function.  In particular, the adoption of forward guidance may be interpreted as a sign that the central bank is indirectly disclosing negative information about risks to the economic outlook. In this case private agents may infer from the forward guidance statement that the recovery may be slower or deflationary pressures stronger than widely anticipated. As a consequence, forward guidance could have a contractionary, rather than an expansionary, effect on economic sentiment.  Hence, in order to be effective, the announcement must emphasise the path of future policy rates, albeit conditional on the underlying state of the economy. The ECB’s forward guidance These considerations have been integral to the design of the ECB’s forward guidance. Let me explain why. In its July meeting, the Governing Council announced that it expected the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation has been based on the overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the real economy and subdued monetary dynamics. The decision to adopt forward guidance was motivated by the sustained upward and steepening trend displayed by the structure of money market interest rates in the preceding months (see Slide 2). This trend had led to a situation in which part of the accommodation introduced through earlier policy action was being withdrawn.  Moreover, the increased volatility in money market rates made expectations of the effective stance vulnerable to shocks that were disconnected from underlying economic conditions. Thus, precise communication about our monetary policy orientation was necessary to protect the still nascent economic recovery and the healing of euro area capital markets from overly tight and volatile monetary conditions.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Against this background, the ECB’s forward guidance follows two concrete objectives: first, to curb interest rate volatility over the policy-relevant horizon; and second, to anchor rate expectations more firmly around a path that ensures the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability. The ECB’s objective is not to suppress money market volatility. In this crisis, abundant central bank liquidity has compressed prices in many financial market segments. The ability of markets to price two-way risk will be a factor of resilience along the normalisation path. Our objective is therefore not to steer money market rates towards a predefined value but to ensure that their fluctuations remain within reasonable bounds and do not hurt economic recovery. When interpreting the Governing Council’s forward guidance, three elements are particularly relevant.  First, it has been provided before exhausting the scope for further reductions in the key ECB interest rates. In fact, the forward guidance formulation, as decided unanimously by the Governing Council, explicitly incorporates an easing bias, thereby accounting for the possibility of further cuts in policy rates. Second, and most importantly, forward guidance is firmly anchored on the ECB’s mandate and monetary policy strategy. In particular, the path of the policy rates remains conditional on the outlook for inflation and will be reviewed over time within the analytical framework provided by the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.  This analytical framework assesses both economic and monetary developments relevant for inflation. In particular, the conditionality of the forward guidance reflects the two-pillar strategy. That is: the medium-term outlook for inflation is evaluated in terms of economic analysis indicators confirming a broad-based weakness of real economy; and it is evaluated on the basis of monetary analysis indicators confirming subdued monetary dynamics.  Third, forward guidance helps us to focus on our mandate, as it de-emphasises the policy relevance of any single data release and concentrates on the medium term. In other words, through our forward guidance we communicate one – and only one – expectation on how our key interest rates will evolve. It is this – and only this – communication that is relevant to assess our policy orientation. Unless this communication changes, the policy orientation remains unchanged. Has forward guidance achieved its objectives? It is probably too early to answer. But allow me a preliminary assessment. Looking at money market conditions, a number of indicators give us comfort that, in the absence of forward guidance, money market rates would have displayed more upward volatility than was observed.  First, the influence of shocks coming from outside the euro area has been dampened (see Slide 3). Before 3rd July when our forward guidance was announced, econometric evidence from high frequency money market data could not exclude that the 1y1y OIS swap rates in the US and the euro area exhibited a stable relationship. This relationship broke down after 3rd July, but recovered after a while, although with a lower coefficient than before the introduction of forward guidance.  Second, the uncertainty about future monetary policy has declined, which represents a positive outcome of forward guidance (see Slide 4). Less uncertainty about our policy orientation is consistent with lower term premia in money market rates.  And third, forward guidance has somewhat reduced the sensitivity of money market forward rates at various horizons to news and data surprises – of the type which should have a muted impact on our monetary policy conditions.  These include news that are unrelated to euro area fundamentals, for example communication by other central banks about their own monetary policy decisions. And they 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  include data releases that merely confirm our assessment of the outlook, and hence do not bring new information that can change that assessment.  However, one might reasonably ask whether the impact of forward guidance for the whole euro area has been constrained by financial fragmentation. To this I would respond that it is important to emphasise again that the ECB’s forward guidance is linked explicitly to the main policy rate(s) in the euro area. And however fragmented interbank markets are, guiding expectation about the future path of the main refinancing rate is relevant for the refinancing conditions of banks across the euro area.  Overall, preliminary evidence suggests that forward guidance has helped to anchor money market conditions in the euro area more firmly to levels which we consider as an appropriate monetary policy stance, given our present assessment of the outlook for price stability. This can only be confirmed over time. And it is over time that forward guidance will prove its usefulness in protecting our nascent economic recovery. Conclusion Let me conclude.  Faced with sluggish economic activity and limited room for manoeuvre, several central banks have adopted more explicit communication on their future policy orientation in the form of forward guidance. This has served to reassure market participants and the general public that central banks will preserve their monetary accommodation against the backdrop of persistently low growth, employment and inflation. In designing their forward guidance, central banks have been guided by the particular features of their respective economies and the specificities of their mandates.  The common feature among the different forms of forward guidance that have emerged over recent months is that they all aim at reinforcing rather than changing expectations on the overall policy orientation of the respective central bank. It is an essential condition for them to be credible. References Brand C., D. Buncic and J.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Lars Rohde: Recent developments and outlook for the Danish economy Speech by Mr Lars Rohde, Governor of the National Bank of Denmark, at the annual meeting of the Association of Danish Mortgage Banks 2013, Copenhagen, 26 September 2013. *      *      * The global economy is recovering at a moderate pace. In the 2nd quarter, the euro area saw positive growth for the first time in 18 months, and looking ahead, the economy is expected to pick up further, albeit slowly. Activity in the US economy is also set to grow, although bond yields are beginning to rise. Growth is supported by extremely accommodative monetary policy, with the Fed funds target rate close to zero and current large-scale asset purchases. Activity in the Danish economy remains below its potential level, but here, too, there are signs that the situation is beginning to improve. GDP grew by 0.5 per cent in the 2nd quarter. Private consumption was flat, as it has basically been since 2010. In Danmarks Nationalbank’s assessment, macroeconomic balances have now more or less been adjusted following the years of overheating of the economy and the subsequent downturn, and the foundations for renewed growth are in place. Signals from abroad are also more encouraging. Danmarks Nationalbank projects growth at just over 1½ per cent in 2014 and 2015. That is higher than the average growth rate expected for the euro area, but in line with the outlook for Germany. Over the last year, households have begun to take a more optimistic view of the housing market, and more people now expect prices to rise. But the recovery is unevenly distributed across the country. Prices of flats in Copenhagen have risen by more than 10 per cent over the last year. With the most recent overheating of the Danish housing market in mind, we might now begin to ask whether things are moving a bit too fast in Copenhagen. However, the price increases should be seen in the light of the preceding strong fall in 2008–09 and the decline in 2011. An article in Danmarks Nationalbank’s most recent Monetary Review compares price levels for flats in northern European capitals. While an average flat of 100 square metres costs kr. 2.3 million in Copenhagen, it would cost about twice as much in Stockholm and Oslo and three times as much in Paris. In Berlin, on the other hand, the price is kr. 1.9 million. Although these differences can hardly be used as indicators of national price developments, they are illustrative and show that the price level in Copenhagen is not particularly high in an international perspective. Judging by the economic fundamentals, prices are not likely to continue to rise at the pace seen over the last year, and nor should they. In Danmarks Nationalbank’s assessment, prices of flats in Copenhagen are not far from their equilibrium  – although the equilibrium level is difficult to identify precisely. The equilibrium price can be expected to increase by 2–3 per cent annually, but experience shows that there may be large deviations from this trend. As Danmarks Nationalbank has previously pointed out, the structure of housing taxes contributes to instability in the housing market. The outlook that the Danish economy will begin to pick up steam highlights the issue of how much spare capacity we actually have, and when the economy will begin to experience capacity problems. Danmarks Nationalbank compiles the output gap at minus 2½ per cent of GDP. That is not tremendously large, and the economy is expected to approach its potential level in the coming years. It is estimated that employment can increase by around 55,000 without creating inflationary pressures in the economy. This is a snapshot. A couple of years down the line, the figure will be higher if structural unemployment falls and the structural labour force increases as expected. Most of the increase in employment is to be achieved via a higher participation rate, while it is estimated that there is room for unemployment to fall by approximately 15,000. Irrespective of the measure of unemployment applied, unemployment is low viewed over the last few decades. In fact, we are already 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  seeing the first signs that labour is becoming scarcer. For example, there has been a small increase in the number of firms reporting a shortage of labour, and there has also been a higher influx of foreign labour into the Danish labour market in the last few years. This does not indicate that unemployment is far from its structural level. The outlook for the Danish economy does not indicate that fiscal policy should be eased. The timing could prove to be bad, by which I mean that fiscal stimulation of demand might accelerate an upswing, with the risk that the economy rapidly experiences capacity problems. The new fiscal policy framework does not leave scope for further easing. The budget deficit is close to 3 per cent of GDP this year and in both 2014 and 2015 if the expected extraordinary revenue from early taxation of capital pensions is disregarded, as it should be. When the bill was passed, it was a precondition that revenue from such taxation that had been moved forward should be used to reduce the government debt. This revenue is extraordinary and temporary, and will entail a shortfall at a later time. The structural budget balance will deteriorate in 2014 and is close to the Budget Act’s limit of minus 0.5 per cent of GDP. The conclusion is clear. There is neither a need for nor scope for fiscal easing. Lending by banks and mortgage banks to the corporate sector has been virtually unchanged since 2008. But there has been a redistribution among the credit institutions, so that lending by mortgage banks has increased, while lending by banks has declined. This may reflect the need for some banks to consolidate after the financial crisis, encouraging customers  – especially firms – to raise mortgage loans rather than bank loans. At the same time, some firms may have found mortgage loans more attractive. In addition, firms have increasingly sought alternative sources of funding, such as corporate bonds, sector loans and trade credits, export guarantees, etc. The mortgage banks have been able to meet the demand for loans and have thereby contributed to a stable supply of credit in the crisis years. This applies not only in relation to corporate customers, but also in relation to households. The number of families falling behind on their mortgage payments has been low since the mid-1990s. Even the financial crisis led to only a small increase in the arrears ratio for mortgage debt. The question is whether this is also likely to be the case in future. Danish households have far more debt relative to income than families in other countries. This has caused some concern among observers of the Danish economy as to whether the families will be able to service their debt, especially if the Danish economy were to be affected by another serious recession . Let me state this very clearly: Danmarks Nationalbank does not share the view that the high debt ratio among households is a problem in relation to financial stability. Even financially squeezed households typically service their mortgages and cut down on private consumption instead. This affects demand in the economy and hence the corporate sector. That has an impact on macroeconomic stability rather than financial stability, but indirectly the banks may also be affected. Danmarks Nationalbank’s most recent Monetary Review evaluates a number of stress scenarios in which interest rates and unemployment soar and house and equity prices dive. While the selected stress scenarios would led to loan impairment charges for the financial sector overall, the calculations do not point to the mortgage banks being particularly severely affected. This is because the mortgage loan is nearly always the last item of debt that a family with a tight budget defaults on. For most families, even considerable worsening of their finances would lead to only a small increase in the probability of falling behind with mortgage payments. The Danish economy has stabilised. That is also true of the financial sector. For the first time since the collapse of Roskilde Bank in the early summer of 2008, the summer has been quiet – and even sunny. But there are, nevertheless, a couple of financial summer stories to tell. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The first one is about F1 loans, i.e. mortgage loans with annual refinancing. The current debate was triggered by a word of warning from S&P. But the debate on the robustness of the construction behind the F1 loans is much older. Particularly after the auction in December 2008, people began to say, “suppose that...”. Suppose that the bonds had not been sold. At that time it was more the rule than the exception that markets froze. Liquidity typically dried up if doubts arose as to the credit risk. Households’ long-term loans with annual refinancing are based on bonds with much shorter maturities. This has given mortgage banks qualities resembling those of ordinary banks, in that there may be “runs” on them. That risk did not exist under the old mortgage credit model since all loans were “prefinanced”. So the question is, what would happen in practice if a mortgage bank finds itself in a situation – due to uncertainty about the credit risk, perhaps – in which it cannot sell short-term bonds in connection with refinancing. The brief answer is that Danmarks Nationalbank will act as the lender of last resort – as it does for other banks – if the mortgage bank is solvent and can pledge adequate collateral. In practice, the latter would presumably be all the bonds not sold in the market. Mortgage bonds, also bonds issued by the mortgage banks themselves, are now part of Danmarks Nationalbank’s collateral basis, i.e. they may be pledged to Danmarks Nationalbank as collateral. This option will limit the impact of a scenario in which bonds are difficult to sell. So the response to S&P and others is that this is not an immediate threat to financial stability in Denmark. BUT this does not mean that a business model based on Danmarks Nationalbank as the backstop is expedient for private-sector financial institutions. That is not a sustainable solution. One of the strengths of the Danish mortgage credit model should be that it is, inherently, so robust that no subsidisation whatsoever is required. That is exactly what the balance principle aims at. To the extent that it is possible, the mortgage bank should take on credit risk, but no other types of risk. Investor confidence in the creditworthiness and liquidity of mortgage bonds is at the core of the Danish mortgage credit system. I have on other occasions argued that, in order to maintain this confidence, the mortgage banks should take a cautious approach and not go too near the statutory limits. The more resilient the mortgage banks are to losses, the greater is the probability that they can meet their obligations to investors. And all other things being equal, it will take a greater shock to trigger a “run” on the mortgage banks. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the initiatives already taken with a view to addressing this issue. Auctions are now spread over the year, business models and product ranges are being adjusted, and pricing structures are being changed in order to give borrowers incentives to choose products with lower refinancing risk. All these initiatives make positive contributions to the sustainability of Danish mortgage credit. But the system still involves considerable refinancing risk. In 2014, bonds linked to adjustable-rate loans totalling more than kr. 750 billion are currently set to fall due, and the auctions towards the end of the year will be of more or less the same size – just over kr. 400 billion – as the auctions in December 2008. The Danish mortgage credit system has served us well for many years and proved its worth during the financial crisis. All the same – and for good reasons – it remains a subject of debate. I do not believe that we can or should return to the old mortgage credit model. But it is important that you find long-term solutions. The second summer topic has been regulation of the financial sector in the wake of the financial crisis. Both at the international and national level, politicians have taken action during the crisis. A wide range of measures have been introduced: increased capital and liquidity requirements, enhanced governance requirements for financial institutions, a new 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  crisis management regime, to mention but a few. In addition, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has been given additional resources and powers. The crisis revealed various weaknesses, and they have been addressed. But as we have seen previously, pressures to ease the rules will emerge at some point. Personally, I am rather surprised to see what is happening in Denmark. The Bank Rescue Packages enjoyed broad political support and until recently they had a clear aim: a financial crisis – never again! The time had come to tidy up and tighten the rules. However, winds of change seem to be sweeping across the political landscape. Has the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority now been given too much power, and have the requirements imposed on mortgage banks become too tight? It is as if the financial crisis has already been forgotten. But I would be surprised if our collective political memory is that short. If so, it would be shorter than in other European countries. So I would like to remind you that in Denmark we provided massive support during the financial crisis, and the government took on huge risks on behalf of the tax-payers. Under Bank Rescue Package 1, the government provided guarantees for an astronomical kr. 4,200 billion. With Bank Rescue Package 2, the government gave the financial sector a capital injection of kr. 46 billion in order to prevent a potential credit crunch, and it guaranteed debt issuances of kr. 194 billion. On the fifth anniversary of the introduction of the general government guarantee, the government has still injected capital totalling kr. 31 billion into the sector. So far, the government has not had any direct costs that have not been covered by the sector’s payments for this support, but the risk has been enormous. In that perspective there can be no doubt that there was a need for tightening. Yes, we have come a long way in terms of tidying up, but it would be unfortunate if the pendulum has already begun to swing back. Thank you for inviting me to speak. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Paul Tucker: Monetary strategy and prospects Speech by Mr Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor Financial Stability at the Bank of England, Member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Member of the Financial Policy Committee and Member of the Prudential Regulation Authority Board, at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe flagship conference on “Financing growth”, London, 24 September 2013. *      *      * Around the western world monetary policy is at a critical juncture. As differences in the relative pace of recovery in different economies become apparent, each central bank is having to articulate how it sees the particular conditions it faces. Contrast that with early 2009, when we were all simply priming the monetary pumps to prevent our economies slipping into depression and deflation. Indeed, contrast it with 2011 and 2012 when, again, central banks acted more or less in unison to contain, as best we could, the spillovers from the crisis in the euro area periphery. Today, although normality is hardly restored, we are back to circumstances where differences in local economic conditions matter to domestic monetary prospects and to exchange rates.  The big policy trade off In the UK, the core challenge lies in balancing two medium-term risks – to the economy’s productive capacity and to price stability.1 Concretely, the longer the weakness in activity, the greater the erosion of the economy’s capital resources and the damage to the skills and capabilities of our labour force. The Monetary Policy Committee has needed to provide monetary stimulus not only to contain the short-term economic weakness but, even more important, to reduce its longer-run costs – social and economic. But we cannot do that at the expense of price stability – or, more technically, of allowing medium-term inflation expectations to drift away from the target of 2%. Were the anchor to slip, our ability to support recovery would be undermined. It is sometimes suggested that independent central bankers are more averse to inflation than to periods of low growth and increased unemployment. I hope the past few years have demonstrated that, in fact, it is the credibility of the Bank of England’s commitment to price stability that enabled us to provide such exceptional monetary support to help the recovery. It is unimaginable that, prior to Bank independence in 1997, any government would have been able to hold the policy rate at effectively zero and make a further monetary injection of £375bn without inflationary expectations – and government financing costs – spiralling out of control. But credibility is not to be taken for granted. Even we cannot provide stimulus without limit, without a wary eye to inflation expectations.  Nor has it been at all easy to judge just how much stimulus has been needed to secure recovery given the extraordinary uncertainties about what is going on in the real economy. On the one hand, the rise in unemployment, while inflicting a terrible cost on those directly affected, has been a lot smaller than anyone would have expected given the weakness in output. On the other hand, this means that productivity has fallen over recent years, leaving it some 15% below current estimates of its pre-crisis trend path – in sharp contrast to the US. Let’s be clear: we do not understand why productivity has been so weak. And that means that we are highly uncertain about the amount of slack in the economy currently and prospectively; uncertain about the extent of the consequent downward pressure on domestically-generated inflation; and, thus, uncertain about the path of output and employment consistent with non-inflationary growth. That sums up the background to my                                                 1 This is reflected in pages 13–15 of Monetary Policy Committee’s document on forward guidance, available online at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  approach to policy settings over the past couple of years. Provide stimulus; pause to see whether inflation expectations remain anchored; if, but only if, they are and more stimulus is needed, provide it etc. A “probing” approach. The MPC’s framework of forward guidance And, as I see it, that is broadly consistent with the Committee’s new framework of Forward Guidance. The government having revised its Remit to the MPC, the Committee has, in effect, formally clarified that it is adopting a probing approach to policy in order to strike the right balance between risks to stability and the risks of sclerosis.  To be clear, I do not see the Forward Guidance – and personally would not favour – committing the Committee to knowingly keeping policy loose beyond the point that would be prudent. I say that because, in parts of academia and the commentariat, the expression “low for long” is used in a rather special way to mean just that: that policy should be loose beyond the period that, ex post, would warrant special stimulus, in order actively to deliver a persistent rise in inflation and inflation expectations above target, thereby pushing down prevailing real rates of interest and so accelerating recovery.2 While not without insight on the mechanics of monetary stimulus, that stream of economic modelling makes the absolutely critical assumption that even as the monetary authority deliberately generates a persistent rise in inflation, its anti-inflation credibility remains 100% intact; later, the central bank simply announces that things are back to normal. That is utterly unrealistic. To re-iterate: the MPC’s forward guidance provides an articulated framework for a probing approach to policy, without a change in our preferences on inflation.3 Saying more about the Committee’s approach to policy in this way might be particularly valuable during a period when signs of recovery have become more apparent. These are conditions in which it would be very easy for the financial markets, businesses and households to jump to the mistaken conclusion that monetary stimulus will soon begin to be withdrawn. Given the slack in the economy, the Committee is not in a rush. Assuming anchored inflation expectations, an orthodox central bank would not contemplate beginning to withdraw stimulus until the economy had reached “escape velocity”, which I have defined to mean “the economy growing, and being set to continue to grow, at a pace that gradually absorbs the slack in the labour market and within firms”.4 And at that point the central bank would assess the erosion of slack in the economy and thus the extent to which downward pressures on inflation were dissipating. Since my own policy deliberations have been framed in terms of “escape velocity”, I saw real merit in any MPC Forward Guidance being cast in terms of a threshold for real growth. Manifestly, this could not be a measure of slack in the economy; it would be clear what it was and was not. Once passed, it would prompt a rich assessment of slack and inflationary pressures, drawing on the widest possible range of indicators. The Committee decided on a threshold specified in terms of unemployment.  The MPC’s threshold is what it says: a threshold for assessing inflationary pressures, although the Committee must maintain that broader assessment month-by-month, quarter-                                                2 See Woodford (2012), “Methods of Policy Accommodation at the Interest-Rate Lower Bound,” presented at the Jackson Hole symposium. 3 This is consistent with Bean (2013), “Global aspects of unconventional monetary policy”, the Monetary Policy Committee’s Forward Guidance document (op cit); and with the Governor’s remarks during the August Inflation Report Press conference: “guidance is not a change in the reaction function, but it gives a better sense of the MPC’s reaction function to financial market participants”.  4 See remarks at the Treasury Select Committee hearing to discuss the Inflation Report on 28 June 2011, and 2012 and 2013 Annual Reports on Monetary Policy to the Treasury Select Committee.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  by-quarter. The threshold is not a target. Indeed, a monetary authority cannot have a target for unemployment; it can have a target only for price stability, as Paul Volcker recently stressed.5 That is why the Committee’s Forward Guidance incorporates, crucially, a “knockout” for inflation expectations, where individual members will have to judge whether they are “sufficiently well anchored”. Beyond that, I am glad that in its “financial stability knockout”, the Committee has in effect recognised that monetary policy influences risk-taking behaviour in the financial system.6 This does not mean that the MPC will suddenly lurch towards a supplementary goal of trying to control excesses in markets. The UK’s new architecture gives the Financial Policy Committee some tools to do that where there is a threat to the stability of the financial system. But in the limit monetary policy can be a backstop – as booms and busts increase the likelihood that inflation will be volatile in the future. Overall, the Committee’s Forward Guidance can forestall avoidable uncertainty about its “reaction function”, about how policy will be set. But it does not affect the greater uncertainty about the evolution of the recovery. Uncertainties about the economic outlook Of course, financial markets inevitably transform the Committee’s state-contingent guidance into predictions of when the Committee will begin to withdraw monetary stimulus; the markets trade instruments with different maturities, ie with time-contingent features not with state-contingent contractual triggers. But the MPC provided state-contingent guidance for a reason. We cannot wave away the uncertainties surrounding the performance of the real economy. If we only understood why productivity growth has been so weak, we could be more confident about whether or not it will recover in tandem with a recovery in spending. If that does happen, the fall in unemployment could be slow, and monetary stimulus might not need to be withdrawn for some time. If, on the other hand, productivity growth remains weak, job creation as the economy recovers could be strong, as it has been on average over the past couple of years. That is why there is a wide band of uncertainty around the MPC’s August forecast for unemployment. My own probability distribution for unemployment is broadly “flat” in the sense that I do not regard one of those scenarios as materially more likely than the other. As data comes in, the Bank’s projections for unemployment are far more likely to change, in one direction or the other, than the Committee’s forward guidance. Probabilistically, that could explain part of the rise in the money market curve given the signs of recovery. All this underlines the need for the Committee to keep under review, month by month, a wide range of indictors of slack in the labour market and in firms. For example, if participation in the workforce develops in unexpected ways, the degree of slack implied by any rate of unemployment might change.7 That recovery is, I trust, finally underway should not be a complete surprise. The MPC has provided a massive amount of monetary stimulus over recent years. Its effects were arrested for an extended period by the threat of severe turmoil in the euro area, coming on top of an erosion of spending power from rising commodity prices. Monetary policy (and credit policy for that matter) works partly by incentivising households and firms to bring forward future spending. They were not likely to do so when the risks and uncertainties on our Continental doorstep were so great and so unusual. As those immediate risks and uncertainties receded,                                                 5 See Volker (2013), “Central banking at a crossroad”.  6 On the “risk channel” of monetary policy, see Stein and Hanson (2012), “Monetary policy and long-term real rates”; Tucker (2012), “National balance sheets and monetary policy: lessons from the past”; and Borio and Zhu (2012), “Capital regulation, risk-taking and monetary policy: a missing link in the transmission mechanism?”. 7 This is broadly comparable to shifts in the velocity of money affecting the interpretation of the rate of growth of the money stock when monetary aggregates were used as targets by UK governments in the 1980s. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  it was as if UK monetary policy was being switched back on.8 With monetary stimulus maintained, now within the framework provided by the Committee’s Forward Guidance, recovery will continue to be underpinned – although of course the road will be bumpy.  That is a key element of what, in our internal discussions, I have called the Keynesian part of the Bank’s policy response to the crisis. The Funding for Lending Scheme; the liberalisation of our liquidity insurance to the banking system – through the Extended Collateral Term Repo scheme and the liberalised Discount Window Facility; and the Financial Policy Committee’s related Recommendation to the Prudential Regulation Authority to relax liquidity requirements on banks – all these fell under the same broad heading. “Keynesian” because we are supporting demand in order to help smooth the adjustment the economy is going through. But a central bank’s monetary and liquidity interventions cannot remove the need for adjustment. The UK economy entered the crisis with too much debt in banking, in the household sector, in government and, for the nation as a whole, externally. And the UK entered the crisis with the composition of demand imbalanced – too much public and private consumption, too little net trade. Indeed, aggregate demand had been unbalanced for so long that the economy’s productive capacity was (and probably still is) unbalanced, investment in capital having followed the pattern of demand. For prosperity to be put on a secure footing for the longer term, adjustment is still needed.  With one vital exception, engineering structural change in the economy is not the responsibility of the central bank. The exception of course is the safety and soundness of the banking system, which is a precondition for broader monetary stability. An undercapitalised banking system would not be able smoothly to supply sufficient credit to aid recovery as demand picks up, enabling investment in innovations and efficiency. Nor has it been able to do so as much as needed to help capital shift to firms and sectors that are beneficiaries of the new pattern of global and domestic demand. In my view, that may explain some of the weaknesses in productivity growth.9 The Financial Policy Committee required recapitalisation of the UK’s big banks and building societies not simply because that is needed to underpin stability, which it is, but also because a resilient banking system is a precondition for sustained and better balanced recovery. New entrant banks can do a bit, but the big incumbent banks need to be healthy too.  Their repair is now underway. That has required, and will continue to require, realism about asset values, expected losses and risks – not pretending, taking the medicine. In that sense, it is a policy in the spirit of Hayek.10 So the overall policy package has combined Keynes and Hayek.  Conclusion In the wake of such a massive crisis, recovery has needed active monetary, liquidity and banking policy. Beyond the realm of central banking, it needs supply-side reform – to create optimism about higher incomes and better investment opportunities in the future.                                                 8 See the Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee’s meeting on 7–8 November 2012: “At the present time, it was possible that elevated uncertainty and a desire to reduce leverage meant that real activity was less responsive to lower borrowing costs than normal. But this situation could easily reverse, and with it the traction that lower yields could have in stimulating demand and output.” 9 See Broadbent (2012), “Productivity and the allocation of capital”, pages 30–33 of the Monetary Policy Committee’s November 2012 Inflation Report: and Tucker (2013), Annual Report to the Treasury Select Committee. 10 There is echo of this in Bean (2013), “Global aspects of unconventional monetary policy”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  If recovery does gain traction, the MPC will need to avoid misperceptions about the likely course of policy. The MPC is using Forward Guidance to help avoid those possible misconceptions. The Committee cannot make the uncertainty about the supply side of the economy and, thus, about the degree of slack go away. But by adopting a probing approach and maintaining an eclectic approach to its assessment of the outlook, the MPC has the wherewithal to provide broadly the right degree of stimulus without risking, or diluting its commitment to, price stability.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sabine Lautenschläger: Supervisors without borders Speech by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger Deputy President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the evening reception of the ESE (The European Supervisor Education Initiative) Conference 2013 “The future of European financial supervision”, Frankfurt am Main, 26 September 2013. *      *      * 1. Introduction Good evening to you all, ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome to the Regional Office in Hesse. For many of you, this day of the conference has been quite intensive. You have listened to lectures in the rooms of the Goethe University, covering a wide range of topics including European supervisory systems, market and banking structures as well as systemic risks and macroprudential supervision; you may have had intense discussions following these lectures. And now you are back in the world of the famous author Johann Wolfgang Goethe. “What am I talking about?”, you are probably wondering. The unifying theme of the art in this building is “Frankfurt, Goethe, Money”. And I will begin at the core of my remarks this evening with a quote which from my point of view fits perfectly to our situation as banking supervisors. It is a quote from Goethe’s Faust: “In the beginning was the deed”. Under this motto, I would like to take three steps together with you. 2. The preceding five years Let us first go back a step: to the preceding five years, which were marked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing crisis. A crisis which shaked the very foundations of the financial system and the European monetary union. The financial system’s weaknesses were abruptly laid bare. We observed, when push came to shove, how quickly banks’ inadequately small buffers were depleted, with many institutions requiring life support in the form of government assistance. It also became instantly clear that banks’ internal control systems were no match for the complexity and interconnected nature of the risks involved. However, the crisis did not remain confined to the financial system. The focus soon turned to government budgets, which in some cases were already in critical condition, and which then threatened to collapse under the weight of the rescue packages. The distress which many countries were then undergoing made the banking sector’s problems even worse. However, this was also a time of reforms and change. At the initiative and under the leadership of the G20, policymakers, regulators and supervisors undertook to develop a programme of comprehensive financial sector reforms, which are now gradually being implemented. This time also included the establishment of ESE, the European Supervisor Education initiative in 2009 – a project involving supervisors and central bankers as wells as academics. ESE is a joint venture which has set itself the task of ensuring uniform training of supervisors at a high level in Europe and promoting the sharing of knowledge between researchers and practitioners. After all: a stable financial system requires not just good rules but also highly qualified supervisors in order to enforce these standards. 3. The present Let us now take a step forward – to the present. Where do we stand now, five years since the outset of the crisis? Despite all the criticism about the seemingly sluggish pace of reforms: I believe it is quite fair to say that we have made very tangible progress. The implementation of the revised Basel standards will make banks more resilient. We have tightened the requirements for risk management and expanded our horizon by integrating 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  macroprudential knowledge. And these are just a very few items from among the many reform projects currently ongoing; I’ll spare you the full list. However, a decision on what is probably the most important innovation was taken just recently. I am referring, of course, to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, or SSM, here in Europe. I have high expectations of the SSM and think it will help us to detect risks in the European banking sector at an earlier stage in future and to tackle them more rigorously. Although I am in favour of a different legal basis, one that could simplify matters a lot given the now very complex SSM governance structure, I am nevertheless convinced of the advantages of the SSM. One factor will be decisive for the success of the SSM: close and constructive cooperation between all parties involved. The SSM is designed as a system composed of the ECB at the centre and the national competent authorities carrying out decentralised processes and procedures. As members of the supervisory teams and the decision-making bodies, the only way we can meet the high expectations of the SSM is if we all pull together. I am especially looking forward to even closer cooperation in the future with our colleagues from the ECB and the other national supervisory authorities. Cooperation is also the guiding star of ESE. The initiative has already shown us how cooperation between supervisors can be made to work. As my fellow board member Rudolf Böhmler illustrated this morning, ESE seminars are attended by participants from a multitude of institutions and countries. This spirit of cooperation exemplifies what will be important in the SSM. Like us supervisors, ESE, too, has recently seen eventful times. Last year, we saw a considerable increase in the number of seminar participants – a noteworthy success and confirmation of the excellent work by those responsible for ESE. These parties include the Programme Council, composed of proven supervisory experts and responsible for keeping the content of the training measures up to date at all times. The Steering Committee and the ESE Secretariat naturally also play a pivotal role. At this juncture, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the representatives of ESE for all that you have done to make ESE one of the leading training initiatives for supervisors in Europe. 4. The future Let us now take a further step – forward – and venture a look into the future. Now that the European Parliament has approved the draft legislation, the SSM can soon be officially launched. We have a year full of hard work ahead of us. Thankfully, the preparations are in progress – through the High Level Group of ECB and national authorities’ representatives and the many affiliated working groups, the basic framework of the SSM has already been laid out. Over the coming months, we will define the further details of the cooperation between the ECB and national supervisors and codify them in a Framework Regulation. We will continue our work on the organisational and operational structure of the new supervisory regime and institute an efficient reporting process. However, in my opinion, it is the balance-sheet assessment which represents the greatest challenge in the months ahead of us. The ECB needs a clear picture of the actual risk faced by the banks it will be supervising. Moreover, light needs to be shed on which balance-sheet burdens arose under the watch of national supervisors. We therefore need a thorough and rigorous review of balance-sheets. This will be the first test of the SSM and of cooperation between the authorities involved. Though we don’t have much time at all to accomplish this extremely complex task, I believe that, if we act in unison, we will succeed. One year from now, the preparations will be completed and the SSM will take the helm. In order for the SSM to exploit its advantages, one thing will be paramount: a consistent supervisory approach incorporating the strengths of individual national approaches and experiences. This common supervisory approach must build on established principles such as risk-orientation, proportionality as well as an integrated micro and macroprudential 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  supervision. It will be particularly important to strike the right balance between ensuring fair competition by treating the same risks equally and, at the same time, allowing for varying market and banking structures as far as these cater for the heterogeneous needs of the real economy. However, this supervisory approach must not exist only on paper, but must also be infused with life. I see ESE as playing an important role here. ESE can support us supervisors in conveying the new supervisory standards and thus make a crucial contribution to consistent and high-quality supervisory practice in the SSM. As supervisors in a system currently encompassing 17, and soon 18 countries, however, we need not only technical expertise but also communication and teamworking skills. We need not only specialists but also first-class networkers. This corresponds to ESE’s approach, which from the beginning was aimed at creating a joint European supervisory culture. And this is why there has always traditionally been a social event at each ESE seminar. This conference is no exception, and I am already looking forward to an evening of exciting and stimulating conversation. 5. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, ESE can look back upon a successful history, and I am convinced that the SSM will make good use of ESE’s expert knowledge and experience. I wish the organisers of the European Supervisors Education initiative and all their helping hands every success for the coming challenges. There are two thoughts I want to leave you with before I invite you to help yourselves at the buffet and look more closely at the works of art under the motto of “Frankfurt, Goethe, Money”. The first thought is: the banking union can succeed only if every single one of us, supervisors and supervised alike, is ready to take action and welcome the new. The second thought is – and this is addressed not only to the ESE seminar participants, but to all parties involved in the banking union – we must be willing to keep learning, to open ourselves to new ideas and experiences, and to bring along the “doubting Thomases”, the hesitant ones, for the ride. The Bundesbank will make every effort to support this process – with words, and with deeds. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Barry Whiteside: Lifting financial literacy levels in Fiji Speech by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the launch of the Be Money Wise (BMW) Program, Suva, 20 August 2013. *      *      * Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen and, most importantly, all the children present here today.  Introductory remarks  A very warm welcome to you all.  I am delighted to be present here today at the official launch of this important initiative – the “Be Money Wise” (BMW) Program. This launch marks another milestone in our journey towards lifting financial literacy levels in Fiji.  Background  Please allow me to share with you the concept of the Be Money Wise Program which has evolved out of the work being carried out in our capital market for a number of years now.  The objective of this Program is to teach our children “money smart” principles by using creative fun-filled activities. In time we expect that this will lead to the development of a culture of financial prudence in our children, preparing them well for their adult working life. The activities planned within the program are focused on the importance of acquiring good money management skills so our children will learn how to save and understand the concept of investing in the various financial products available in Fiji. The program will run from 2013 to 2020 as an important part of the Reserve Bank’s National Capital Markets Master Plan 2020.  The BMW Program is intended to complement what children learn in school through the national Financial Education Program.  I would like to now address our children in particular at this time.  Girls and boys, we have used the Bee in the Be Money Wise logo so that you can identify with the program easily – just as some of you already do with our financial literacy mascot, “Vuli” the vonu.  The Honey Bee in the logo represents the hard working and productive nature of the Bee. The Bee is well known for being a very productive insect. If you watch a swarm of bees working at their hive you will notice that each bee has a particular job to do. Bees also plan for the long term. Honey is produced by bees as a food source. In cold weather or when fresh food sources are scarce, bees use their stored honey as their source of energy.  In the same way, the BMW Program aims to remind you to always work hard and to be productive and creative in managing your money and in making financial decisions. Always think and plan for your future, just as the bee does. And just as the honey produced by the Bee has many uses, so does the knowledge that you will gain through this program.  You will see that the body of the Bee in the logo is a light bulb with the dollar sign representing the knowledge and understanding that you will gain from the program.  Now to all the parents out there, let me stress that the earlier we start to save and put money aside for future plans, the earlier we are able to achieve our financial goals and enjoy financial security for our children later in life. Investing in our children’s future must begin today.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches The financial literacy principles of saving and investing are important to both the financial security of individuals and the financial security of our nation.  The task of imparting these principles to the children of Fiji will require the support of all stakeholders and most importantly, parents and guardians. Parents and guardians are in the best position to ensure that their children continue to save, budget, plan and practice good money management habits. We need to share and talk frankly with our children about money matters and teach them by example of the little things we can do to improve their money management skills.  Today’s BMW program has a series of activities organised by the Reserve Bank, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, Fiji Police Force, Land Transport Authority, Yellow Ribbon Project, Goodman Fielder, Fire Authority of Fiji, UNICEF, and the University of the South Pacific.  To all the children registered for today’s program or watching this on TV, make the most of this opportunity. Learn all you can and ask questions of the RBF staff or the stakeholders in our main tent if you do not understand anything you’ve heard today. And when you go home, I urge you all to talk about what you have learnt with your family and all your friends. You are more than welcome to visit the Reserve Bank if you wish to know more.  I also thank all the commercial banks and other financial institutions for sponsoring the prizes for our schools competition, and to all other stakeholders who have provided prizes for activities throughout that day. Your commitment to the BMW Program is greatly appreciated.  Lastly, I thank the Hibiscus Event Group for allowing the Reserve Bank to organize this special day and to launch our program.  With these words, I have much pleasure in launching the Reserve Bank of Fiji Be Money Wise Children’s Program and wish you all a very enjoyable day.  Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Louis Kasekende: Improving rural access to finance in Uganda Opening remarks by Dr Louis Kasekende, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the official launch of the Uganda Rural Challenge Fund, Kampala, 19 April 2013. *      *      * Your Excellency Klaus Dieter Düxmann – the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany Distinguished guests Members of the Press Ladies and Gentlemen, Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here this afternoon to witness the official launch of the Uganda Rural Challenge Fund. The Fund will provide grants aimed at supporting innovations that will lead to increased access to finance for rural enterprises in Uganda, the bulk of which are still locked out of the formal financial sector. The “rural unbanked” as you will all agree with me pose some challenges in as far as the financial sectors contribution to growth through financial intermediation is concerned. Firstly, the rural population cannot be ignored given its substantial contribution to GDP through agriculture estimated at about 23 percent of the total. Secondly, the rural population constitutes a large share of the total population estimated at about 85 percent of the total population. There is therefore a large potential market for savings mobilization which is yet to be tapped by the financial sector. Looking at the financial access statistics, only 38% of Ugandans receive financial services from both formal and informal sectors moreover when drilled down further only 20% use formal sector financial institutions i.e. commercial banks Tier 1, credit institutions (Tier 2) and microfinance Deposit Taking Institutions (Tier 3). This means that nationwide, 62% of Ugandans are not served by any financial institution or groups (formal, semiformal or informal). Further, the disparity between urban and rural access to financial services is so wide with urban access at 48% compared to rural access at 35%. This would suggest that more than 12 million adults in rural areas do not have access to financial services. So definitely there is a lot of work to be done if the financial sector is to reach the more than 12 million rural adult population. Further as of 2012, Uganda’s savings to GDP ratio of about 11.8 percent is among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Impediments to organized savings are among others, high fees, high minimum deposits and physical distance from banking institutions.1 According to the World Bank Financial Inclusion index (Findex) 2011, maintaining a checking account in Uganda costs the equivalent of 25 percent of GDP per capita annually, and about 54 percent of non-account holders cite cost as a reason for not having an account. These costs are still high and there is scope for lowering them. There are a number of options available that could be tapped into to address some of these problems. For instance banks, credit institutions and microfinance could open branches even where they are unprofitable in the interim so long as they could be funded by other profitable branches; extending mobile banking services, set up agencies etc. Developments in new technology particularly mobile and internet banking could be leveraged to provide a notable platform for improving financial inclusion and an opportunity to move towards branchless                                                 1 Odongo, Albert. “Why Ugandan Banks should start promoting a saving culture.” 26 March 2012. Accessed on 17th January 2013. [http://www.africa-uganda-business-travel-guide.com/why-uganda-banks-should-start-promoting-a-saving-culture.html] 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  banking. With technology costs falling over time this is one opportunity for addressing some of the cost issues. This notwithstanding, commendable growth in terms of products, size and intermediation has been registered in Uganda’s financial sector over the last decade or so. This growth has however not compromised its soundness, owing in part to the prudent regulation and supervision by the Bank of Uganda. For instance, Commercial banks’ lending to the private sector increased from Shs. 681.9 billion in December 2001 to Shs 7,755.3 billion in December 2012, yet the Non performing loans as a ratio of total gross loans declined from 6.5 percent to 4.2 percent over the same period. Other positive developments in the sector include the increase in the number of banks from 20 in 1999 to 24, bank branch network to more than 455 branches compared to 153 in 1999, and ATM’s to more than 600 from 430 four years ago. Amid these developments, there have been other equally important developments in form of massive investment in human capital accumulation in the sector, leveraging of technology to deliver better services, and continued innovation to meet user demands as evidenced by some new products such as internet banking and mobile banking, dedicated products for SME’s, credit cards, points of sale services with major service providers and retailers, etc. It is in this regard that I wish to appreciate and applaud KfW/GTZ/GIZ whose programs in microfinance, rural and agricultural finance and setting up of the credit reference bureau have contributed towards improvements in the sector and augur well for future improvements to the sector. I therefore thank the German government for the continued support to Uganda in many aspects, but particularly, the support through KfW and GIZ which is geared towards developing the financial sector in Uganda. I wish to highlight the fact that the Bank of Uganda is cognizant of the challenges in the financial sector and is taking several steps to address them. One such move is our financial inclusion agenda that aims at improving the access and quality of financial services, enhancing consumer protection and creating a larger population that is literate in financial matters and values savings. In order to facilitate the extension of financial services at a greater convenience and cheaper cost to the unbanked population, the Bank forwarded to the Minister of Finance, necessary amendments to the Financial Institutions Act 2004 and the MDI Act 2003 to allow agency banking and Islamic banking. In order to augment the safety of savings of the predominantly rural clientele, the amendments further include bringing the large Tier 4 microfinance institutions that may surpass a set threshold under the regulatory ambit of the Bank. We at Bank of Uganda see the Rural Challenge Fund as another timely and significant initiative that will help cover some of the costs that the financial institutions incur in their endeavor to extend financial services to rural areas. The fund is also expected to motivate the financial institutions to try out new rural focused approaches that they could not undertake single handedly because of the perceived risk. While we welcome this initiative that largely addresses the supply of loanable funds to the rural sector, we must remain mindful of the need to address the issues that constrain rural enterprises like Agricultural small holder farmers from accessing formal credit and being profitable. Failure of delivery of necessary public goods and services such as quality extension services, market information and rural infrastructure may impede the effectiveness of great innovations like the Rural Challenge Fund. I am personally excited about the Rural Challenge Fund, more so because it compliments Government efforts in improving access to credit to transform a predominantly agriculture based-rural sector through among others-the Agricultural Credit Facility (ACF). I thus encourage eligible financial institutions to take advantage of this great opportunity. Thank you very much for listening to me. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Barry Whiteside: Update of the global and Fijian economy Address by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the Fiji Economic Update, Suva, 20 August 2013. *      *      * Mr Ikbal Jannif, Pro Chancellor & Chair of the USP Council Dr Esther Williams, Deputy Vice Chancellor, USP Excellencies and Members of the Diplomatic Corps Permanent Secretaries Professor Jafarey, Head of the School of Economics, USP Distinguished Guests Students Ladies and Gentleman Bula vinaka and a very good morning to you all. Introductory comments First of all, let me thank Professor Jafarey for his kind invitation for me to speak to you this morning. It is always pleasing to address a forum such as this, where academics, policy makers, NGO’s and the general public can put our heads together and discuss Fiji’s economic issues. Economists, as we all know, will have differing opinions on economic performance and it is no different here in Fiji. However, the discussions today will help identify economic challenges and constraints and enable us to debate solutions so that we may achieve our full potential. Let me therefore applaud the University of the South Pacific for organising this important forum every year. I see my role this morning as helping to prepare the ground for further deliberations later today. My address will cover what we at the Reserve Bank deem to be the current state of the economy and some of the challenges we are facing. In discussing our general macroeconomic environment I will also point out areas where we have excelled and one or two where we have not, and some of the key risks we face as we set ourselves up to move ahead. The global economy On all occasions when we make such reviews we first touch on what is happening around us. As a small open economy it is very likely that developments offshore will work their way back to Fiji in one form or another. Hence we need to assess the risks and opportunities in this area. The recovery after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), unfortunately, has been uneven and rather short-lived. Advanced economies remain jolted with poor confidence, high unemployment and unsustainable public debt. Some are also grappling with weak financial sectors. The emerging & developing economies, while performing relatively better, have now also succumbed to the latest slowdown. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised global economic growth downwards three times already this year. We see that the world economy is now poised to grow by 3.1 percent. While growth for 2014 has also been downgraded, the good thing is that it is expected to higher than this year, at 3.8 percent. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Fiji’s major trading partners, those economies with which we have important trade and investment links, have also not been spared and are facing numerous challenges of their own. The US economy is quite fragile after facing fiscal challenges and poor confidence. Across the Atlantic, the Euro zone is mired in a prolonged recession and is facing record high unemployment. We are talking here of numbers in excess of 25 percent, or 1 in 4 people without a job. It is worse for the youth of these countries where up to 2 out of every 3 young people between the ages of 18 to 25 years, or 66 percent, are without jobs. Many member countries have needed bailouts and are struggling to contain debt in the midst of a growing backlash from the public over harsh austerity measures which are part of deals struck by their respective Governments for the bailouts. Closer to home, economic activity in Australia and New Zealand remains patchy as growth remains uneven across sectors. However, both these economies are expected to have growth in excess of 2.5 percent. The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its policy interest rate this month to a new record low to assist growth. In Japan, there are spurts of optimism following massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, although it is yet to be seen how this can spur sustained growth in light of the weak demand across the globe. As I alluded to earlier, the emerging economies, the main source of global growth in recent times, are losing steam as well. China’s heavy reliance on investment and credit to spur growth in the past decade has resulted in vulnerabilities in the financial sector, government finances and real estate, while India faces its own challenges, including high inflation. These, coupled with a slowing global demand have brought down their growth prospects to the lowest in a decade. The Fijian economy Let me now turn to the Fijian economy. In spite of my earlier comment, we have been fortunate in that our economy has so far been somewhat shielded from the global slowdown. Our GDP expanded by 2.2 percent last year following a 1.9 percent expansion in 2011. Growth prospects are expected to improve further to around 3.2 percent this year and, with the exception of the mining & quarrying sector, all sectors will contribute to this growth. The projection for 2013, if achieved, will be the highest since 2004 and is a culmination of detailed re-assessment of the relevant data and information available, as well as direct feedback from a wide cross section of industries and sectors. As you may be aware, over the past two weeks we have had an IMF Article IV Mission visiting the country on their regular annual survey to assess how we are doing. We had numerous discussions with them on the economy and, as we are closer to the ground or “coal face”, we shared with them the latest numbers and business sentiments. While we did not agree on every issue (again this is not uncommon amongst economists), there was a general consensus on two fundamental issues with regard to economic growth. Firstly, the IMF team agreed that economic growth for 2013 would be higher than in 2012 (they have a forecast of 3 percent) and secondly, Fiji has the potential to do even better! The Fijian economy’s improved outlook is validated by a host of indicators. Consumption activity has been upbeat from last year and is a reflection of the lower personal income taxes, higher inward remittances, improved employment prospects and cheaper and easier access to credit. New lending for consumption purposes more than doubled to $247 million in the first half of the year when compared with the same period last year. Other indicators such as VAT collections, imports of consumption goods and new vehicle sales are also registering significant annual gains. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The improved consumer confidence has translated well to business and investor confidence. Investment is forecast to be around 28 percent of GDP this year, compared to an estimated 18 percent of GDP last year and above the Government target of 25 percent. We last only briefly touched on these levels back in 1998 and 1981! Recently, significant new investments have been noted in the aviation, tourism, mining and financial services sectors while the Government has embarked on massive public infrastructure projects in roads, ports and bridges. Our garments and manufacturing sectors are also showing much greater confidence with higher investments this year and more envisaged. The surge in investment is well reflected in new bank lending for investment purposes, which rose by 154 percent in the first half of this year. Our labour market has been improving in line with the improved investor confidence, though unfortunately we do not have any recent official numbers from the Bureau of Statistics. The Reserve Bank’s latest Job Advertisements Survey shows that the number of vacant positions advertised rose nearly 14 percent in the first half of this year. On the production side there has been mixed results. Gold production has been declining significantly over last year. This year again there are no expectations of a significant pick up in gold output and this is quite unfortunate as this means we are unable to capitalize on the existing high world market price. Cane and sugar production are expected to improve this year after declining last year due to the two major floods. Data from the Fiji Sugar Corporation reveals that cane crushed so far this year is around 10 percent higher than last year and more sugar has been produced with a further improvement in the TCTS ratio. It is especially heartening to see the improvements of the Sugar Reforms now slowly coming to fruition and there is still more work being done in this critical industry of ours. The tourism industry continues to be robust despite some declines in visitor arrivals last year and the early part of this year due to natural disasters. Gross earnings for 2012 were $1.3 billion and this momentum is expected to continue over the medium term. Right now we are in the peak tourism season and data on room occupancy and visitors from our major markets, such as Australia and New Zealand, are favourable. Ladies and gentlemen, the Reserve Bank of Fiji has maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance since November 2011 and the banking system is awash with liquidity, which has put consistent downward pressure on market interest rates. Lending rates in the financial system are now hovering at historically low levels while capital and money market rates also continue to trend downwards. Against this background, domestic credit has continued to gain momentum with private sector credit growth expanding by 9.6 percent in June, further signaling the improved confidence in the economy. Our challenges Whilst we may applaud ourselves for the progress we have made in raising our growth prospects and revitalising some of our sectors on the backdrop of a weak global economy and other domestic challenges – many other hurdles face us and could restrict us from forging ahead on a path to sustainable growth. We totally agree with the IMF comment that we can do more. While it is encouraging that investment has picked up and is poised to even surpass the Government’s target of 25 percent this year, maintaining it at such levels remains an important challenge moving ahead. This requires that we continue with the current monetary and fiscal incentives and at the same time improve our ease of doing business. Sentiments from the business community suggest that there are still a number of hurdles in registering and conducting business which can be streamlined and better managed by the relevant 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  agencies. Improving our ease of doing business will not only encourage local investors but also help attract the much desired foreign investors. We also must be mindful that consumption and investment led growth cannot be sustained for too long as they have heavy import content. This can be counterproductive if not matched by gains in our export and service sectors and negatively impact our fragile external balance. Our export sector is small and highly vulnerable to changes in global demand and domestic supply constraints and shocks. In this regard, policies aimed at export diversification and promotion and import substitution remain as paramount as they were before. Restoring the sugar industry back to its glory is also necessary given its importance as a major foreign exchange earner and the indirect spin-off activities it creates in the Western and Northern Divisions. The Government’s grants to the sugar mills to improve efficiency and the Sugar Action Group’s strategies to improve cane yield and farm productivity are welcomed. While the Government’s commitment to revitalizing the sugar industry is encouraging, it is imperative that these plans are brought to fruition sooner rather than later, so that the industry is able to sustain itself without grants, subsidies or preferential prices. However, it is well understood this can be a daunting and difficult task and cannot be achieved overnight. Ladies and gentlemen, poor and inadequate infrastructure has been for many years, not only a deterrent to growth, but also a frustrating experience for all Fijians. Improved infrastructure can go a long way towards boosting agriculture as well as boosting the economies in our rural and maritime areas. Again the Government’s planned reforms in road and port maintenance and upgrade is welcomed and we hope the constraints of poor infrastructure no longer remain constraints moving ahead. I note that the $420 million earmarked for roads and other infrastructure projects this year appears to have already generated a lot of confidence and activity in the business community, not the least being the large investments in new trucks, utility vans and buses. Keeping Government debt low is another challenge, not only for Fiji, but the world over. Public debt has become a topical issue these days given the awful experience in Europe which has required many countries to seek bailouts and adopt harsh and extremely unpopular austerity measures. Small developing economies like Fiji are even more disadvantaged as we cannot sustain high public debt for too long due to limited and volatile revenue streams of Government and the need to maintain adequate fiscal buffers to mitigate future crises. Fiji’s Government debt is currently estimated to be just under 50 percent of GDP. While we are a bit fortunate that we have relatively low external Government debt, of around 15 percent of GDP, which shields us from exchange rate risks, Government must remain committed to reduce our total debt further. Appropriate fiscal consolidation, effective tax collection, civil and public sector reforms and the creation of new high taxed industries, such as mining, can provide the necessary avenues to reduce our debt to more sustainable levels and perhaps later to the IMF benchmark of 40 percent of GDP. Ladies and gentleman, while I have elaborated on the major macroeconomic challenges, there are a few others worth mentioning which can also provide the necessary base for sustained economic growth moving ahead. These include well known issues such as land reform, raising agricultural productivity, solid and clear progress towards parliamentary democracy and ensuring inclusive growth for all. For many of these, great strides have been made and some are still work-in-progress and I wish the very best to the relevant agencies involved in spearheading these initiatives. Concluding remarks Let me conclude by highlighting to you what we at the Reserve Bank sees as some of our current macroeconomic strengths. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  We have made a significant turnaround from a contraction in 2009 to three years of consecutive economic growth. In addition, growth in each succeeding year from 2010 has been higher. Growth this year is forecast to be higher still, while growth in 2014 and 2015 is expected to be above our historical average. Consumption and investment – both important indicators for growth and job creation, have surged, boosting business and investor confidence. This has been supported by reforms undertaken in a number of areas to improve efficiency and reduce dependence on Government hand-outs, resulting in the privatization of a number of state owned enterprises. In addition, apart from maintaining fiscal discipline, the Government has channeled more funds to productive sectors and infrastructure investments. Incentives given by Government have been targeted and transparent and the reduction in corporate and personal taxes has not had an adverse impact on Government revenue. The Reserve Bank’s monetary policy objectives remain intact. The weak global demand and absence of major natural disasters so far this year has helped us contain inflation which was registered at 1.9 percent in July. In the absence of any major price shocks we expect inflation to be around 3.0 percent by year-end. Foreign reserves have increased annually since 2009 and have helped boost confidence in our financial system. As of yesterday, reserves held with the Reserve Bank were above $1.84 billion, a historical high and sufficient to cover 5.2 months of retained imports of goods and non-factor services. Ladies and gentleman, the numbers are coming together for us and I have not seen them this good for a long time. The Government has played its part in recent years and continues to do so, but we are also now seeing the Private sector, the often quoted “engine” of growth, stepping up to the plate in a serious way. On our recent road trips in the central and western divisions and in discussions with captains of Fijian industry we have noted a general buzz of confidence. A confidence and optimism that has this sector spending money to grow their businesses, and in their doing so, they grow Fiji. On that note let me thank you all for your kind attention. I wish you all the best in today’s presentations and deliberations and hope that we can together come up with innovative ideas in further addressing our economy’s challenges. Before I finish, please allow me to relate a brief story to you. Many years ago I used to play in the Suva Cricket Competition for a team made up of players of different ages varying from school boys to near senior citizens, both locals and foreigners and of many different ethnic backgrounds. We were truly a mixed bag of people who loved the game. We did not come from the well known traditional cricketing strongholds of Lau or QVS, and were not part of the expatriate players who grew up representing their schools in Australia or New Zealand and who opted to join the top teams here. We were just your bunch of keen cricketers bent on succeeding as a unit. We committed ourselves and played smart and moved from the “C” Grade to the “A” Grade competition in 3 seasons, playing at the top level and holding our own for a number of years after that (there were of course many more teams back in the 1980s and cricket actually had exclusive use of Albert Park from October to April each year!). We had achieved much of what we set out to do through great teamwork and much enthusiasm for what we were doing. I can still remember those days quite vividly and it was a great experience in togetherness. We actually called ourselves Tovata Heads, which for us literally meant “heads together”. Vinaka vakalevu and thank you all for listening. END 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ravi Menon: Global regulatory reforms – what’s done, what to watch for Opening remarks by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the 4th Pan-Asian Regulatory Summit, Singapore, 25 September 2013. *      *      * Mr Leas Bachatene, VP & Managing Director (Asia Pacific), Thomson Reuters Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Exactly five years ago, this month, Lehman Brothers collapsed and unleashed a financial crisis of unmatched scale and impact. The crisis exposed deep fault lines in the global financial system and spurred far-reaching financial regulatory reforms, aimed at building a more resilient financial industry that better serves the needs of the real economy.  This morning, I will take stock of the impact of these regulatory reforms: • the progress we have made in making the global financial system safer; and • the possible unintended consequences that we must watch for.  As a member of the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and various other international regulatory forums, the MAS has been a strong proponent and early implementer of many of these reforms. But we have not flinched from going above international standards where necessary or refraining from some measures in other jurisdictions which we regard as not relevant in our context. Progress in regulatory reforms Let me start with the progress in regulatory reforms. Increasing the capacity to absorb losses A centrepiece of the reforms in banking is the new Basel III capital standards. Basel III does three things.  • First, it raises the quantity of capital that banks must hold. By providing a buffer for banks to absorb losses, capital helps to minimise spillovers to the rest of the system.  • Second, Basel III raises the quality of capital that banks must hold. The crisis has shown that common equity is the most effective capital instrument to absorb losses and write-downs.  • Third, Basel III brings back to banks’ balance sheets many off-balance sheet exposures and applies appropriate capital charges on them. Many banks that had to be rescued in 2008 had capital adequacy ratios well in excess of the minimum requirements then. They got into trouble because they had many risky off-balance sheet exposures they did not hold capital against. Singapore has fully implemented the Basel III capital requirements, two years ahead of the timeline prescribed by the Basel Committee. And by 2015, Singapore-incorporated banks will meet capital requirements which are 2% points higher than the Basel III minimums – in effect a surcharge to reflect their systemic importance in our economy and financial system. There is no global capital standard for the insurance industry. This is a lacuna that needs to be plugged. But the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) has taken the lead to formulate standards for a risk-based solvency regime for insurers. The EU has built on this to develop detailed capital standards known as Solvency II. Many jurisdictions are reviewing their rules with the intent to align with IAIS standards. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Singapore was among the first jurisdictions in Asia to introduce a risk-based capital (“RBC”) framework for insurers, in 2005. In 2012, MAS embarked on a review to enhance the framework, known as “RBC 2”, to take into account the new IAIS standards and best practices, including relevant aspects of Solvency II. MAS will be conducting a quantitative study to assess the impact on the insurance industry of the proposals under RBC 2.  There are no global capital standards for capital markets services providers. The International Organisation of Securities Commission (“IOSCO”) has, however, set out principles for the solvency of securities market intermediaries. Based on these principles, MAS has implemented a risk-based capital framework for capital markets services licensees. Strengthening liquidity buffers The second important area of reform is setting – for the first time – international standards for bank liquidity. Banks are in the business of transforming short-term liabilities (mainly deposits) into long-term assets (mainly loans). This fundamental mis-match in maturity opens banks to the risk that they may not be able to finance short-term liabilities as they fall due. Even solvent banks with lots of capital can fail if liquidity risks are not well-managed.  The new Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) sets the global minimum standard for bank liquidity. Essentially, the LCR framework requires banks to have an adequate stock of high quality liquid assets that can be converted into cash to survive a 30-day period of stress. In Singapore we have had liquidity rules for a long time. Our risk-based Minimum Liquid Assets framework requires every bank to hold a minimum percentage of its qualifying liabilities in liquid assets. We are now looking to adopt the Basel III LCR rules, with some enhancements to suit domestic conditions.  • Although Basel III applies the LCR framework only to internationally active banks, we propose to extend the LCR requirement to all banks in Singapore in the first instance and grant various reliefs on the basis of risk-mitigating circumstances.  • We will also have a tighter definition of what qualifies as eligible liquid assets and not recognise equities and mortgage-backed securities.  MAS has issued a consultation paper on the implementation of the LCR framework and will carefully consider industry feedback. Constraining leverage The third important area of reform is in constraining the build up of excessive leverage. At the height of the crisis in 2008, the banking industry was forced by markets to reduce leverage in a manner that led to downward pressure on asset prices, which in turn led to losses, declines in bank capital, and contraction in credit. Even banks with high risk-based capital adequacy ratios were found to be excessively leveraged.  Basel III’s leverage ratio seeks to set a 3% floor for the amount of Tier 1 capital that a bank needs to hold relative to its total exposure. The ratio is designed as a non-risk based measure to complement the risk-sensitive capital adequacy ratios. It acts like a stop-gap to constrain the overall size of the balance sheet, especially given the uncertainty involved in the risk models that banks use to calculate their capital needs. But the leverage ratio  – precisely because it is a non-risk based measure – cannot be a substitute for risk-based capital requirements and should not be set at too high a level as to become the binding constraint on banks. If it were so, banks may have the perverse incentive to increase their exposure to risky assets so as to earn a higher return on capital. The final calibration and definition of the leverage ratio is expected to be finalised in 2017, with the minimum leverage ratio requirement coming into effect in 2018. Singapore-incorporated banks can comfortably meet the current testing minimum of a 3% leverage ratio.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Making OTC derivatives trading safer The fourth fundamental area of reform is in the OTC derivatives market. The crisis highlighted how the opaque inter-connections across financial institutions engaged in trading complex derivative contracts over-the-counter led to rapid contagion and systemic crisis when liquidity suddenly dried up. Reforms have focused on four areas: standardisation of derivative contracts; central clearing; higher margin requirements for non-centrally cleared trades; and mandatory reporting of all trades. In particular, reporting to trade repositories will provide much-needed transparency on exposures across market participants. MAS has taken steps to implement the trade reporting regime in Singapore. Financial institutions which book prescribed OTC derivatives in Singapore are required to report such trades to a trade repository licensed by MAS. The reporting framework will be up and running next month, starting with interest rate and credit derivatives. The degree of standardisation of contracts in these asset classes is higher, so starting with these contracts will provide for a smoother phase-in.  We have received feedback from the industry on operational difficulties in obtaining customer consent in order to report counterparty information to trade repositories. We are looking to amending legislation to address this issue.  Ending too-big-to-fail The high-profile, public rescue of many large, systemically important financial institutions in the last crisis has galvanised a powerful resolve to end the “too-big-to-fail” problem. But this has proven to be one of the most challenging tasks facing global regulators. To be sure, the FSB and Basel Committee have made good progress on several fronts.  • First, they have identified a list of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).  • Second, they have set out additional loss absorbency requirements for G-SIBs to reduce the probability of these institutions failing.  • Third, there is ongoing work on a resolution framework to minimise the cross-border negative externalities that can be created by their failure. At the same time, major jurisdictions are embarking on plans to reform banking structures in a bid to end “too-big-to-fail”.  • In the US, the Volcker rule prohibits US-operating banks from engaging in proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund.  • In the UK, the Vickers Commission recommends ring-fencing retail banking activities, and subjecting the ring-fenced entity to higher capital requirements.  • In the EU, the Liikanen report proposes a mandatory fencing off of banks’ proprietary trading and market making activities from the rest of the banking group, if the activities exceed a certain threshold, with higher capital charges imposed on the investment banking ring-fence.  To the extent that structural measures help to simplify business models and facilitate the resolvability of very large and complex global banking groups, they can help to reduce the risk and impact of failures. But it is not clear if the benefits of such measures outweigh the costs in all instances. First, it is worth considering whether size or complexity are the critical factors. The Global Financial Crisis started not with large universal banks or large global banks, but with narrow or specialised players: Northern Rock in the UK, and investment banks like Bear Stearns and 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Lehman Brothers. Interestingly, the Liikanen report observed that there was no business model that performed particularly well or poorly during the crisis. Second, it remains unclear if structural reform measures can make a bank or banking group safer if a culture of excessive risk-taking is not curtailed and if risk governance frameworks are not strengthened. MAS subscribes to the universal banking model on the premise that it is not the separation between risky and non-risky activities that matters as much as ensuring that risk is well managed wherever it is.  • For domestic banks, MAS does not impose any structural measures. The focus is instead on ensuring that their risk management capabilities are commensurate with the complexity of their activities and that capital and liquidity buffers are healthy. • For foreign banks that have a significant presence in the retail market, MAS will require local incorporation of their retail operations. The banks can choose to subsidiarise their entire operations within the same legal entity or continue to operate its wholesale banking business under a branch structure. There is no retail ring-fence required. Unintended consequences  It is imperative that we press on with the regulatory reform agenda and not succumb to reform fatigue. But even as we do so, we need to be mindful of unintended consequences.  Inconsistent implementation of rules The first unintended consequence is the inconsistent application of rules across jurisdictions and across sectors.  Inconsistent application of rules across jurisdictions leads to the risk of regulatory arbitrage. Take for example, the new capital rules. It is laudable that within such a short period of its promulgation, 25 of the 27 member jurisdictions of the Basel Committee have issued the final set of Basel III regulations. But the implementation has been uneven. The Basel Committee conducted studies on the consistency of risk-weighted assets measured in the banking book under the internal model approach. It found considerable variation across banks in average risk-weighted assets for credit risk. A material part of this variation was due to different bank and supervisory practices. Such differences in measurement could result in capital ratios varying, in extreme cases, by as much as two percentage points in either direction. To enhance consistency in implementation, the Basel Committee is considering three steps:  • first, improve public disclosure and regulatory data collection to help the market and regulators to better understand how risk-weighted assets are derived;  • second, narrow the range of acceptable modelling choices for banks; and  • third, provide additional supervisory guidance for model approvals. Inconsistent application of rules across entities carrying out similar activities leads to the issue of shadow banking. The higher capital and liquidity requirements required under Basel III may create the incentive for activities to be conducted outside the regulated banking sector. The FSB estimates that shadow banking constitutes about 25% of the total financial system, and with regulation of banks still tightening, analysts expect the shadow banking sector will continue to grow. But this is not to suggest that intermediating credit through non-bank channels is to be discouraged. The shadow banking system can provide market participants and corporations with a useful alternative source of funding and liquidity. Some non-bank entities may have 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  specialised expertise that enables them to provide certain credit intermediation services more efficiently and at lower risk. Shadow banking need not be a bad word in finance. What we do need to watch out for is the accumulation of risks in the shadow banking sector and the potential spill-over of these risks to the regulated banking sector. The FSB is setting out approaches to monitor the shadow banking system and to identify possible regulatory measures to mitigate shadow banking risks.  In Singapore, MAS has taken steps to limit the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage between the bank- and non-bank sectors by adopting broadly consistent rules for similar activities, even if they are being conducted by different types of entities. For instance, capital requirements for banks, insurance companies, and capital market intermediaries are broadly aligned for similar types of risks, to deter regulatory arbitrage.  Cross-border implications of national rules  The second unintended consequence is the cross-border implications of national rules. • Take for example, the US CFTC’s OTC swap rules. These rules apply to financial institutions operating outside the US including foreign-domiciled financial institutions and foreign branches of US financial institutions. • Another recent example: the European Market Infrastructure Regulation requires financial market infrastructures to be subject to European rules or rules that are deemed equivalent to Europe’s before they can provide services to EU players. These rules are well-intended and seek to address genuine regulatory concerns in these jurisdictions. But extending national rules across borders often gives rise to overlapping regulations, which can create additional compliance costs for internationally active financial institutions. If there are conflicts between different national requirements, or if the burden of complying with multiple sets of rules is significant, this may prevent the execution of trades on a cross-border basis. The risk is that the global derivatives and foreign exchange businesses, for example, might become trapped within regional borders, creating fragmented markets. Cross-border application of national rules may also risk complicating home-host collaboration, the principle of consolidated supervision, and cross-border resolution.  • A BIS working paper published in April 2013 cautioned that it may be difficult to design resolution plans for global banks which are required by different national regulations to operate different business models. • An IMF staff discussion paper published in May 2013 highlighted that differences between national structural reforms could lead to cross-border regulatory arbitrage by global banks, posing a challenge to consolidated supervision.  In the event that the imposition of national regulations across borders is unavoidable, we need robust mutual recognition frameworks in place. Such frameworks should be based on an outcome-based approach, and not a line-by-line correspondence of rules.  • We are encouraged that regulators in the US and Europe have adopted a substituted compliance or equivalence assessment approach so that entities can comply with just the set of rules applied by the jurisdictions in which they operate.  • MAS supports substituted compliance and equivalence assessments as an important measure to avoid potentially duplicative or inconsistent rules, particularly for entities with international operations.  In the area of OTC derivatives trading, MAS is putting in place the rules and infrastructure to support cross-border operations and to help reduce uncertainty to the industry. To allay concerns from the industry over the regulatory burden of having to comply with both home 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  and host regulations, we are participating in equivalence assessments under the US and European regimes.  Thus far, ESMA, the European securities regulator, has recommended to the European Commission that the Singapore framework is broadly equivalent to Europe’s, paving the way for central counterparties in Singapore to offer their services to European participants.  We have also submitted to CFTC an application for substituted compliance in respect of requirements on US banks operating here. We are in active discussions with CFTC, and will work with them on the substituted compliance determination, where appropriate, as our OTC regulatory regime comes into force.  Impact on trade finance and long-term finance  The final unintended consequence is the impact on trade finance and long-term finance. There are concerns that the various regulatory reforms taken together may lead to a pull-back in trade finance and long-term investment financing. The global regulatory community and national governments have become increasingly sensitised to these concerns. In the area of trade finance, the Basel Committee consulted the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and other relevant bodies. A number of adjustments were made to the capital and liquidity rules to facilitate trade finance.  • In the area of capital rules, the Basel Committee waived the one year maturity floor for certain trade finance instruments under the advanced internal ratings-based approach for credit risk. It also waived the sovereign risk-weight floor for certain trade finance-related claims using the standardised approach for credit risk.  • In the area of liquidity, the Basel Committee issued guidance for national supervisors to apply relatively low run-off rates for trade finance commitments.  Preliminary data suggests that the availability and cost of trade finance has not been greatly impacted to-date by the implementation of Basel III. Spreads have normalised post-crisis and pricing appears to be influenced more by broader macro factors and competition. Further, there are many well-capitalised banks, especially in Asia, that are well-placed to operate in the new regulatory regime; and many of them have stepped up.  We should continue to monitor closely the impact of regulatory changes on trade finance. Trade is the lifeblood of Asian economies. But we have a bigger challenge in long-term financing, especially for infrastructure. It may be the case that the post-crisis financial system may not be adequately structured to provide certain types of long-term financing. • First, longer-term corporate and project finance loans already attract a higher capital charge compared to short term loans. Coupled with the increased overall capital requirements under Basel III, this may create a disincentive for long-term loans.  • Second, to meet liquidity requirements, banks may substitute long-term lending activities with short-term lending. In calculating the Net Stable Funding Ratio, lower weights are assigned to loans with maturities of less than a year. • Third, Solvency II, which will impose higher risk charges on longer-dated assets, may result in insurers de-risking by taking on shorter-dated assets. • Fourth, the interaction between central clearing, margining and capital requirements may impact the variety and liquidity of some derivatives such as long-dated interest rate swaps used to hedge risks associated with long-term financing. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  There may be scope for some intelligent, risk-sensitive fine-tuning of regulation: • The design of risk weights for insurers should not penalise them for holding good quality long term assets, if they are matched by long term liabilities. • The preferential treatment of sovereign debt in bank regulation should be re-examined, so that banks are not disincentivised from holding good quality, long term corporate debt. • Better calibration of the risk weights for securitisation for banks and insurers may be necessary.  But the fundamental solution does not lie in diluting regulatory requirements. Policymakers should also focus on ways to develop sustainable alternative sources of long-term finance. At the same time, we must recognise that the immediate constraint on infrastructure development in Asia is not financing per se but the supply of bankable projects with an acceptable risk-return profile to attract banks or investors. We need integrated solutions that involve risk-sharing arrangements and bring together bank and non-bank capital. In Singapore, we are working in partnership with a diverse group of stakeholders, to help build such an ecosystem to support long-term financing and unlock the supply of bankable projects. • Multilateral agencies and well-rated public sector entities could provide guarantees or credit wraps that would allow banks to reduce their risk exposures to such long-term projects, thereby encouraging them to originate such loans. • Bank loans could be structured in ways that facilitate their seamless migration from banks to capital markets. • Institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds could invest in project bonds, infrastructure debt funds, and securitised project loans, taking the risks off banks’ balance sheets. Conclusion Let me conclude. We have made reasonable progress in making global finance safer. The regulatory reforms since the crisis have helped to strengthen the resilience of the financial system. But the work is far from complete. We must not forget that regulation must be complemented by rigorous supervision and sound risk management. We cannot rely too much on regulation alone to make finance safer. As Jacques de Larosiere reminds us: “Strong, intrusive supervision as well as careful risk assessment and management by bankers are of the essence. They will never be replaced by rules.”  Put differently, a culture of prudence and risk governance is a better guarantee of safety and soundness than all the rules on capital and liquidity that we can draw up. Finally, we want finance that is not only safe but also purposeful. Regulation must not seek to eliminate all risk and must be impact-sensitive. Let us not lose sight of the bigger picture: a sound financial system that is able to play its vital role of intermediation, to support sustained economic growth and help create opportunities for individuals and enterprises.  Thank you.   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Vítor Constâncio: 2012 Bernácer prize award ceremony in honour of Nicholas Bloom Speech by Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the Awarding Ceremony of the Germán Bernácer Prize for Promoting Economic Research in Europe to Nicholas Bloom, Madrid, 24 September 2013. *      *      * I wish to thank Marie Hoerova for the help in preparing this text. Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to be part of this session to award the 2012 Germán Bernácer Prize to Nicholas Bloom, Professor of Economics at Stanford University. Nicholas Bloom has made influential contributions to the academic debate in two broad areas, both of which are of great relevance for central bank policy-makers. First, his research on the effects of policy and economic uncertainty on business cycles helped us understand better some of the key contributing factors to the protracted slump in output during what has become known as the Great Recession. Second, his research on the determinants of good management practices at the firm level provided important insights on how to support long-term economic growth and competitiveness, including in the European context. The financial and economic crisis that started in the summer of 2007 brought about unprecedented challenges for central bank policy-makers. Some well-accepted paradigms and widely used models have come to be questioned. It is of course the fact of life that central bankers operate in an ever-changing and, to use one of the keywords from Professor Bloom’s research, uncertain world. It is thus an important responsibility of a central bank to ensure that relevant new insights from academic research find their way into the actual conduct of monetary policy. The Eurosystem attempts to cope with this responsibility by fostering a constant intellectual exchange with the research community. The ECB organises great many seminars, conferences and workshops where the most recent research findings can be discussed, and invites leading scholars to visit and conduct research in the ECB, for example by means of the Wim Duisenberg Fellowship. Moreover, the ECB supports promising young researchers by funding five Lamfalussy Fellowships each year. The aim is to promote policy-relevant research that meets the highest academic standards. The ECB also leads and co-ordinates research efforts through Eurosystem research networks to obtain research output which is necessary for ECB decision-making but which is as of yet unavailable at universities or other research institutes. I will come back to activities of one such research network at the end of my remarks. Research by Nicholas Bloom analysing the effects of uncertainty shocks on the economy is a prime example of a policy-relevant research output. Published in Econometrica in 2009, it could not be more timely.1 The unprecedented level of uncertainty has been one of the key distinguishing features of the Great Recession. Economic uncertainty refers to an environment in which little or nothing is known about the future state of the economy. There is a variety of sources of economic uncertainty, ranging from wars, acts of terrorism and natural disasters to changes in economic and financial policies. Professor Bloom highlighted the adverse effects of heightened uncertainty on economic activity. Uncertainty leads firms to cut back or defer hiring and investment decisions. It also drives consumers to put off buying new goods. As a result, uncertainty can escalate financial stress and recession, as well as                                                 1 Nicholas Bloom, 2009, “The impact of uncertainty shocks”, Econometrica 77(3), pp. 623–685.

Professor Bloom’s work on uncertainty inspired further research on the effects of uncertainty, including on the links between uncertainty and monetary policy.3 For example, the idea that changes in uncertainty may interact with monetary conditions and can drive global financial cycles was one of the themes in this year’s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, the annual gathering of prominent central bankers, finance ministers, leading academics and financial market players from around the world.4  Because of its latent nature, uncertainty is difficult to quantify and has to be measured indirectly using a variety of indicators. Here, too, Nicholas Bloom, together with Scott Baker of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago, made an important contribution in developing an economic policy uncertainty index for the US, Europe and other major economies. The measure has been used not only in academic papers but also by investors and financial professionals.5 It has also been subject to intense discussions in the blogosphere in view of some of its political uses. The difficulties in finding good indicators controlled to avoid reverse causation and the use of political events provided fodder for the debates. Professor Bloom’s work on measuring uncertainty stimulated more systematic analysis of uncertainty indices also at the ECB. We developed our own composite uncertainty indicator which combines four components: systemic stress, uncertainty of private households and firms, political uncertainty and financial risk aversion. Measurement difficulties were also an issue Professor Bloom had to tackle in the second strand of his research, namely in his research on the role of management practices in driving productivity and growth differentials across companies and across countries. Due to an absence of good quality data on management practices, little prior research was conducted on this important topic. To address this gap in the literature, Nicholas Bloom, together with John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics, developed a methodology for quantifying management practices. They carried out a large research project which used a new survey approach to measure management practices in a systematic way in more than 4,000 manufacturing firms across Europe, the US and Asia. The aspects of management practices their approach focuses on are systematic performance monitoring, setting appropriate targets, and providing incentives for good performance. They showed that firms with better management practices are larger, more productive, grow faster, and have higher survival rates. A conservative estimate indicates that differences in management practices                                                 2 See Nicholas Bloom, 2011, “The uncertainty shock from the debt disaster will cause a double-dip recession”, VoxEU.org, 22 August; and Scott Baker, Nicholas Bloom and Steven J. Davis, 2012, “The Rocky Balboa recovery”, VoxEU.org, 20 June. 3 There is a vast body of literature that builds on Nicholas Bloom’s uncertainty research. I will only name a few papers which involved ECB researchers. Using German data, Popescu and Smets find that uncertainty shocks are less important drivers of business cycles compared to financial risk aversion shocks; see Adina Popescu and Frank Smets, 2009, “Uncertainty, risk-taking and the business cycle in Germany”, CESifo Economic Studies 56(4), 596–626. Bekaert et al. document that a lax monetary policy in the US decreases both risk aversion and uncertainty, with the former effect being stronger; see Geert Bekaert, Marie Hoerova and Marco Lo Duca, 2013, “Risk, Uncertainty and Monetary Policy”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 60(7). 4 See Hélène Rey, 2013, “Dilemma not trilemma: The global financial cycle and monetary policy independence”, paper presented at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. Incidentally, Hélène Rey was the 2006 Germán Bernácer Prize winner. 5 For more details on the construction of the measure see Scott Baker, Nicholas Bloom and Steven J. Davis, 2012, “Measuring economic policy uncertainty”, working paper, Stanford University. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  account for a significant proportion (10–30%) of the differences in productivity between firms and between countries.6  Their research did not stop at documenting the impact of the differences in management practices. They also offered suggestions for policy interventions that could encourage the uptake of good management behaviour. Competitive and flexible markets enable managers to re-optimise resources within and outside the firm more easily. Educational standards matter as well. Better-managed firms have better educated workers and they use them more efficiently. Moreover, better educated managers have necessary skills to adopt state-of-the-art management practices and adapt to changing environment. This enables them to maintain and improve their global competitive position. Multinational companies also have a strong positive effect, as they transplant their management styles to the countries in which they operate.7  These research-based conclusions highlight a key role of structural reforms in the wake of the global economic crisis. Countries with more competitive market conditions, better education and more investment in R&D and innovation policies can maximise the beneficial impact of managerial capital on productivity and growth. From the policy perspective, competitiveness issues have been identified as one of the root causes of the economic crisis in Europe and have therefore been explicitly included in the surveillance processes established at EU/euro area and G20 level. To further advance research in this area, the Eurosystem established the Competitiveness Research Network (CompNet) at the end of 2011. The network’s objective is to develop a more consistent analytical framework for assessing competitiveness, one which allows for a better correspondence between determinants and outcomes. To do so, the network functions as a unique forum in which different approaches and measures of competitiveness can be discussed, researched and developed, and eventually reconciled. Developing a framework which includes a complementary use of micro and macro data can lead to improved analyses of competitiveness issues.8 I am confident that Nicholas Bloom will continue making extraordinary contributions to this and other research areas in the coming years. I herewith extend my sincerest congratulations to you – Nicholas – for winning the 2012 Bernácer Prize.                                                  6 See Nicholas Bloom and John Van Reenen, 2007, “Measuring and explaining management practices across firms and countries”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122(4), pp. 1341–1408; and Nicholas Bloom and John Van Reenen, 2010, “Why do management practices differ across firms and countries?” Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24(1), pp. 203–224. 7 In a recent contribution, Nicholas Bloom and co-authors showed that US multinationals obtained higher productivity from IT than non-US multinationals and that establishments taken over by US multinationals (but not by non-US multinationals) increased the productivity of their IT.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: Resilient banks – essential building blocks of a stable financial system Speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the 18th Annual Banking and Insurance Conference “Making finance work in a higher capital world”, organized by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, London, 24 September 2013. *      *      * 1 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen Many thanks for inviting me to this year’s conference. It is a real pleasure for me to speak before you today because I spent many years of my career in the private sector. Today, however, I speak to you as a central banker and thus from a regulator’s point of view. From time to time banks and regulators are portrayed as opposing forces. To me, this seems a bit off the mark – not least because I know both sides rather well. In the end we all share the same objective: a stable financial system. And a natural starting point from which to build a stable financial system is the individual bank. Banks are the elementary building blocks of the financial system and to ensure financial stability we need resilient banks. 2 What defines a resilient bank? But what is a resilient bank? To begin with, a resilient bank is able to withstand shocks. A resilient bank enjoys the confidence of investors and customers. Thus, it will receive funding – both wholesale and retail – at adequate prices even during periods of stress. But how do investors and customers recognize a resilient bank? Is it like the famous giraffe: hard to describe but you know it when you see it? Well, there are certainly times when this is the case. Usually, however, resilient banks have specific characteristics that set them apart from other banks. In my remarks today I would like to discuss three of these characteristics – three pillars on which resilient banks rest. 2.1 Capital and liquidity buffers Capital and liquidity buffers should be regarded as the centre pillar. Capital provides a cushion to absorb losses during times of stress. And with the benefit of hindsight, it is now widely acknowledged that prior to the crisis banks’ capital buffers were neither high nor solid enough. The same is true for liquidity. Banks’ role in financial intermediation makes them particularly vulnerable to liquidity risks. And a lack of liquidity can break a solvent bank’s neck. After all, a liquidity squeeze was the defining element of the financial crisis in 2008. In terms of strengthening individual banks’ capital and liquidity buffers, we have come a long way. The Basel III rules require banks to hold more and better capital. These rules have since been transposed into European legislation. Once they are implemented, banks will be able to absorb bigger losses while remaining a going concern – they will be more resilient. Although the implementation will be gradual, banks have already become eager to build up their capital buffers early on. In doing so, they are responding to increased market expectations. In Germany, for instance, the 12 major banks with an international focus increased their tier 1 capital ratios from 13.2% to 15.3% by mid-2013 on a year-to-year basis. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  However, some banks will still have to raise their capital or adjust their balance sheet positions accordingly. Regarding the issue of liquidity, we have, for the first time ever, agreed on an international standard. I am sure that this new standard will increase banks’ resilience to liquidity shocks, promote a more stable funding profile and enhance overall liquidity management. However, more analytical work needs to be done – not least because liquidity regulation is uncharted territory. Moreover, a lot of side effects and unintended consequences need to be fully thought through. 2.2 Profitability The second pillar on which a resilient bank rests is profitability. Banks that are not profitable will lose the trust of their investors and customers, especially in times of stress. Also, they are not able to build up reserves, for instance by retaining earnings. This further weakens them in times of stress. Prior to the crisis, many banks’ ambition to increase shareholder value led to expectations of returns on equity of more than 20%. Generating returns of that order may be profitable but not necessarily sustainable. But banks need business models that are both profitable and sustainable. I am fully aware, though, that this is easier said than done. Just take a look at German banks. Like many of their international peers, German banks have been under pressure from a number of challenges for several years now – some crisis-related, others structural. In addition, the German banking market is still highly dense and highly competitive. For all these reasons, many banks still need to optimise their business models – for instance, by diversifying their funding sources or by giving up business units whose risks cannot be managed effectively. Those banks that cannot adapt swiftly enough to changing conditions should exit the market. Now, when discussing the issue of profitability, it is often held that regulation increases banks’ costs and reduces their earnings. It is certainly true that regulatory requirements do entail some costs for banks. However, I would take a more balanced view on the costs of regulation. Banks tend to overlook the costs of crises, as these are usually borne by taxpayers. Taking these costs into account puts the banks’ criticism in perspective. At the social level regulation still generates a net benefit. 2.3 Good governance Having said that, let us turn to the third pillar of a resilient bank. A resilient bank has a sound governance structure and is committed to high ethical standards. Investors and customers need confidence that banks are managed prudently. These aspects have gained a lot of attention in the aftermath of recent scandals, such as the manipulation of LIBOR and similar financial benchmarks. These cases of misconduct spoil confidence in a twofold way. Firstly, the trustworthiness of banks involved is impaired. And this has negative consequences for the banking sector as a whole. Banks will have to work hard in order to heal the wounds. Secondly, the reliability, robustness and representativeness of financial benchmarks have been called into question. Without doubt, the integrity and credibility of benchmark-setting processes are in urgent need of a general overhaul. We all know: trust is gained only over a long period of time but may be shattered quickly. In a sense, trust is similar to Humpty Dumpty: it is very fragile and, once it has been shattered, all the king’s horses and all the king’s men will not be able to put it back together. In that vein, all efforts to strengthen banks’ resilience can be undone instantly if banks cannot avoid severe cases of misconduct in future. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  This also applies to banks’ risk management capacities. On this issue, however, much progress has been made. The requirements for adequate internal control systems and appropriate governance structures have been tightened substantially. Let me elaborate on this by referring to reforms of banks’ compensation schemes. In the run-up to the crisis, asymmetries in compensation in terms of risk and reward led to short-termism and excessive risk-taking by some employees. Inadequate pay and reward systems contributed to large – and in some cases extreme – absolute levels of compensation. That in turn left firms with less capacity to absorb losses as risks materialised. To safeguard financial stability, compensation schemes in the financial sector must be better aligned with the long-term performance of firms and with prudent risk-taking. International guidelines to this effect have been developed by the Financial Stability Board. To date, the implementation of these guidelines is still seeing good progress. But much work still lies ahead for national authorities and banks. They have to ensure effective implementation of sound compensation policies that lead to more prudent risk-taking behaviour of employees. The strong compensation requirements that Europe has set in the legislative package on capital requirements are an important step in this direction. But achieving lasting change in behaviour and culture will take time and stamina. Banks need to undertake further efforts to publicly disclose easy-to-understand and consistent data on their compensation structures that allow for comparisons across jurisdictions. 3 Looking beyond the individual bank To sum up the characteristics of resilient banks, we can state that they are well-capitalised and have enough liquidity, that they have profitable and sustainable business models and that they are managed prudently. First and foremost, it is certainly the banks’ responsibility to fulfil these criteria. It is the responsibility of regulators, however, to put in place a stable regulatory framework. Nevertheless, in designing such a framework they have to look beyond the individual bank. Experience over recent years has shown that certain dynamics can jeopardise the entire financial system even though all single entities were believed to be sound: the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Therefore, setting regulatory standards to increase the resilience of individual banks is necessary but by no means sufficient. Authorities have to broaden their perspective to cover the financial system as a whole. They have to take into account the problem of systemic risk. Systemic risk can be created by cyclical or structural developments, such as exposure concentrations or externalities caused by the interconnectedness of financial institutions. 3.1 The “too-big-to-fail”-problem The first step in this regard is to acknowledge that even resilient banks can fail. And this might become a problem if the failing bank is very large and interconnected. In such a case it can drag other banks down with it and cause a systemic crisis. Consequently, we have to ensure that such systemically important financial institutions (or SIFIs) can fail without destabilising the whole financial system. What we need are insolvency frameworks that are in tune with the interconnectedness and complexity of the financial sector. Major steps have already been taken in this regard at the international level. The Financial Stability Board has already presented key attributes of effective resolution regimes for financial institutions. These were endorsed by the G20 heads of state and government in November 2011. Since then, work has been under way to transpose this new international standard into national law. A draft directive for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions has now 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  been presented at the EU level. This proposal clearly sets forth the sequence of liability for failing financial institutions – shareholders and creditors are now first in line to bear losses, and rightly so. 3.2 The bank-sovereign nexus Nevertheless, there is still another aspect of interconnectedness that has to be taken into account: the link between banks’ balance sheets and public finances. The crisis has exposed a vicious circle in that connection. If many banks run into financial difficulties at the same time, that can threaten the stability of the entire financial system. Governments then often have no option but to bail out these banks to prevent the system from collapsing. This costs a lot of money. Look at Ireland, for example: rescuing its banks raised the country’s 2010 budget deficit to more than 30% of GDP. By the same token, if government finances run into difficulties, that causes problems for banks – firstly, because many banks have large government bond holdings and, secondly, because the general economic situation initially worsens when a government has to adjust its finances. This feedback loop between banks and sovereigns has to be severed in order to promote financial stability. One measure would be to establish resolution regimes for banks as I have already discussed. Having them in place would shield the government from having to rescue banks with taxpayer money. Another measure refers to capital requirements for banks, which I have also discussed. The objective is to ensure that banks’ economic situation no longer depends on the state of public finances. We can only achieve this if we stop giving government debt preferential regulatory treatment over other loans or securities. Government debt should be backed with a level of capital which adequately reflects its risks. At the same time caps should be imposed on bank sovereign debt holdings. And on a side note: appropriate capital rules and caps on lending to governments also have a disciplining effect on national fiscal and economic policy. Former IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff considers this effect to be stronger than that of stricter fiscal rules. 4 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, resilient banks are the essential building block of financial stability. With a view to regulation we have come a long way since the recent crisis. We have reformed the regulatory framework in a way that will help to increase banks’ resilience. At the same time we have acknowledged the fact that we have to look beyond the individual bank if we want to safeguard financial stability. Thus, although we are on the right track, we should probably move a bit faster with regard to implementing the new rules and standards. But what about the banks themselves? Have they finally understood their role in the recent crisis? Have they looked beyond their own losses and realised the burden they have put on society? I have argued that we have to look beyond the individual bank to safeguard financial stability and what I was referring to was the systemic perspective. But we also have to look beyond the banks to capture the personal perspective. Eventually, it is the bankers’ attitude and culture that are the most essential building blocks of financial stability. Here we still need a change. Bankers have to subscribe to the idea that the financial system is, in essence, a service provider for the real economy. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Martin Flodén: My view of monetary policy and household debt Speech by Mr Martin Flodén, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Swedbank, Stockholm, 24 September 2013. *      *      * This is my first speech since taking up the post of Deputy Governor of the Riksbank. Since I started in the spring I have taken part in two monetary policy meetings. On both occasions I have entered a reservation against the majority decision and advocated a lower repo rate. It therefore seems natural for me to devote my speech today to explaining my view of monetary policy and the reasons for my reservations. Should monetary policy take into account households’ high and rising indebtedness? This is a question that has been central for monetary policy in recent years and also at my first monetary policy decisions. I consider it clear that the Riksbank has a responsibility to safeguard financial stability and prevent crises linked to credit granting. However, it is not so clear what consequences this responsibility has with regard to conducting monetary policy in practice. I shall explain my reasoning at the recent monetary policy meetings. I also intend to comment on how the new framework for macroprudential policy may affect my view of monetary policy. However, I shall begin with a brief description of my view, and the Riksbank’s view, of the economic situation. Positive signs but risks remain In recent months we have been able to see some positive signs in the Swedish economy, and also abroad. Confidence has risen in both the household and corporate sectors in Sweden, and there are some signs that unemployment is falling. In the euro area, GDP increased in the second quarter, after six quarters in a row of falling GDP. Here, too, the confidence indicators are giving more positive signals. However, one must remember that the economies still have a long way to go to reach a normal status. GDP growth and inflation are at low levels in both Sweden and the euro area. And there are still large downside risks for economic developments. In the euro area, the weak public sector finances and problems in the banks’ balance sheets have scarcely improved in recent months. In the United States, the full effects of the sequester have not yet been realised, and there is also uncertainty over how the debt ceiling will be raised during the autumn. Growth rates in large emerging markets like China and India have fallen, albeit from very high levels. Previously, international capital has tended to move towards emerging markets as interest rates have been low in the more developed economies. However, as yields on US government bonds have been rising since the spring, the capital flows have changed direction. The outflow of capital means that exchange rates are weakening, which may improve the countries’ international competitiveness and contribute to maintaining their high level of economic activity. But the large fluctuations in growth rates, capital flows and exchange rates are in themselves problematic and create uncertainty regarding economic developments in the emerging markets. A divided Swedish economy The Swedish economy is dependent on developments abroad, and of course has been affected by the financial crisis and economic downturn in recent years. In an international comparison, overall quantities such as GDP and employment have nevertheless developed well since the financial crisis. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches However, behind the overall picture is a divide, where household finances in particular have been strong. Their disposable incomes have increased every year during and since the crisis (see Figure 1). Growth in consumption has also been good. Housing prices and loans to households have increased rapidly, probably partly due to strong households finances and an expansionary monetary policy (see Figures 2 and 3). Developments in the corporate sector have been weaker, which is reflected in weak growth in exports, low investment and only modest growth in loans to companies (see Figure 4).

4 BIS central bankers’ speeches give both inflation and economic activity a push in the right direction.1 But in recent years, we have also needed to manage the problem of economic activity being at different levels in different parts of the economy. We cannot use the repo rate to stimulate the corporate sector and limit the build-up of household debt all at the same time. In this situation, it is not evident how monetary policy should manage the balance between inflation, economic activity and the risk of an overly rapid increase in housing prices and household credit. Let me elaborate on my thoughts a little further here. Monetary policy must take financial risks into account The concern over lending to households increasing too rapidly has led to a majority of the members of the Riksbank’s Executive Board voting to hold the repo rate at a higher level than would otherwise have been justified. I have entered reservations against these decisions and advocated a lower repo rate, for reasons I will return to later. Despite my reservations, I share the majority’s concern over the rapid increase in household debt. And I consider that monetary policy should, in principle, take into account financial imbalances and risks that may arise as a result of the monetary policy conducted. In what way is this compatible with the Riksbank’s mandate? According to the Sveriges Riksbank Act, the objective of the Riksbank’s activities is to maintain price stability. Moreover, the Riksbank shall promote a safe and efficient payment system. In addition, the preliminary works to the Act state that the Riksbank, without prejudice to the price stability target, should support the goals of general economic policy with a view to maintaining a sustainable level of growth and high rate of employment. At the Riksbank we consider the task of promoting a safe and efficient payment system to have a broad meaning and that it is, in practice, a matter of taking responsibility for promoting the stability of the financial system.2 But it is not actually this task that justifies monetary policy taking into account a rapid expansion in household borrowing. It is namely the case that the preliminary works to the Sveriges Riksbank Act emphasise that the monetary policy instruments shall only be used to maintain price stability, and thus not to promote a safe and efficient payment system.3 We sometimes say that monetary policy shall take financial risks into account, as it can be difficult to stabilise inflation around the target if households are forced to rapidly reduce their debts.4 Such difficulties could arise, of course, but for me it is not consideration of the inflation target that mainly justifies letting monetary policy take financial risks into account. Instead I perceive taking financial risks into account to follow on from the task of “supporting the objectives of general economic policy with the aim of achieving sustainable growth”. A monetary policy that leads to an unhealthy build-up of credit or other financial imbalances is scarcely compatible with sustainable growth. But this task, like the task of stabilising economic activity, is subordinate to the inflation target. Monetary policy’s consideration of financial risks must therefore be weighed against the inflation target and economic developments.                                                   1 For a tool to be sufficient to meet the inflation target and attain a balanced development in economic activity, it is necessary for the economy to mostly suffer demand shocks, not supply shocks. This observation is sometimes called the divine coincidence, an expression coined by Blanchard and Gali (2007). 2 See the Riksbank (2013a) p. 3. 3 See Bill 1997/98:40, p. 54. 4 See, for example, the Riksbank (2013b). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 From principle to practice The question is then how the principle of consideration of financial risks and imbalances should be put into practice in monetary policy. How should the balance between the different tasks be managed? When determining this we must consider whether other tools than monetary policy are more suitable for managing financial risks, whether our concerns regarding household debt are justified and what effects monetary policy has on the imbalances and risks that concern us. I do not intend to conduct any deep discussion of the links between monetary policy and other tools today. As expressed by the Riksbank (2010), I note that it is not primarily monetary policy, but an efficient regulatory framework and supervision that is important to prevent financial imbalances. The way in which monetary policy should take into account financial risks may therefore depend on the formulation of the regulatory framework and the supervision. I shall return to this question when I discuss the new framework for macroprudential policy. Household indebtedness is worryingly high Also, I do not wish to get into a detailed discussion now as to whether the concern over rising house prices and household debt in recent decades is justified.5 It is clear to me that we do not fully understand what the underlying factors are. We therefore do not know whether the upturn is largely explained by fundamental factors or whether it reflects imbalances that have built up in the economy.  Fundamentals that we are not able to disregard include the fact that housing construction is low and has been so for a number of years. A low level of construction, combined with a growing population and a move to metropolitan areas also contribute to a rise in housing prices, and ultimately to an increase in debt. And the conversion of rental properties to tenant-owned properties also contributes to increased debt. A further aspect is that household savings are high and have increased at the same time as debt has increased. But high indebtedness probably means that the economy will be more sensitive to shocks, even if it can be explained by fundamentals. An economic downturn could then be reinforced by households with large debts trying to increase their saving by reducing their consumption. Moreover, we can hardly rule out the possibility that households’ increased indebtedness in recent years has at least partly been caused by unrealistically low expectations of future mortgage rates. In my opinion, it is therefore in principle justified for monetary policy to now take into account the rapid increase in household indebtedness. Risks with a low repo rate A further question is thus in what way monetary policy can lead to financial imbalances building up. International academic research discusses several potential problems that can arise if a central bank holds its policy rate at a low level for a long period of time. Perhaps the most common problem mentioned is that investors will then seek assets with a higher yield, which also have a higher risk. One of many reasons for such behaviour could be that some portfolio managers are required to attain a minimum return on their portfolios. This behaviour risks causing an unwarranted rise in asset prices when interest rates are low.6                                                  5 There is a lively debate on this question. One important contribution to the discussion is the Riksbank’s commission of inquiry into risks on the Swedish housing market (Riksbank 2011). The National Institute of Economic Research (2013) and Svensson (2013a) are examples of newer contributions to the debate, claiming that housing prices and household indebtedness do not comprise an evident problem. 6 See Rajan (2005). 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Another possible problem with low interest rates is that the monetary policy stimulus can help weak companies to get along without having to deal with their problems. In this way, a necessary structural transformation in the economy may be postponed. There is also a risk that the stimulus will help the banks to struggle along with weak balance sheets, which will inhibit credit granting in the economy.7 The problems I have just mentioned nevertheless appear less relevant to current developments in Sweden. But I would like to mention two other potential problems linked to low interest rates, which I think justify the concern over the Swedish economy. My first source of concern is perhaps a little far-fetched.8 Let us say that for some reason we find ourselves in a situation where the repo rate is low and many households are heavily indebted. In this situation a repo-rate increase could have large negative consequences for the indebted households and consequently for the economy as a whole. Then households might believe that future economic policy will be formulated so that such negative consequences are avoided or alleviated. They may then choose to take on even higher debts if they believe – with or without justification – that economic policy will take this into consideration. And these problems risk increasing the longer the repo rate is kept at a low level. Figure 5 Households’ mortgage-rate expectations one, two and three years ahead Per cent  Note.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 A more tangible source of concern is households’ expectations of future interest rates. Surveys show that households (and market agents, for that matter) are expecting much lower interest rates in the longer run than we at the Riksbank are expecting (see Figures 5 and 6).9 Figure 6 Expectations of the repo rate Per cent  Note. Repo-rate forecast from the September MPU. Repo-rate expectations among money market participants 1, 2 and 5 years ahead. The broken lines show an interval for the long-term level of the repo rate of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent. Sources: The National Institute of Economic Research, TNS SIFO Prospera and the Riksbank One possible interpretation of these expectations is that households place too much emphasis on the low interest rates in recent years when they are looking ahead. In this case, further repo-rate cuts risk reinforcing the difference between households’ expectations and the Riksbank’s expectations of future interest rates. And such incorrect expectations may then lead to unwarranted increases in housing prices and household indebtedness. But I would like to point out that it is genuinely difficult to know what will be a “normal” or average level for future mortgage rates. It is not at all certain that the Riksbank’s long-run assessments of the repo rate are more correct than those of households or other market agents. A low repo rate is necessary, despite the risks I have observed that there are risks linked to holding a low repo rate over a long period of time, and that monetary policy should in principle take these risks into account. But at the                                                  9 At the Riksbank, we usually say that the average repo rate in the longer run can be expected to be in the interval of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent (see, for instance, the Riksbank 2013b, p. 47). Short-term mortgage rates are usually 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher. Households’ expectations of short-term mortgage rates five years ahead are now around 4 per cent. And market agents’ expectations of the repo rate five years ahead are around 3 per cent.

8 BIS central bankers’ speeches most recent monetary policy meetings I have nevertheless advocated cutting the repo rate even lower. There are several factors behind this stance. Firstly, a lower repo rate would mean that CPIF inflation returns to 2 per cent even faster and that resource utilisation is more balanced than in our forecasts (see Figure 7). Figure 7 More expansionary monetary policy Effects according to the Riksbank’s macro model Ramses  Sources: Statistics Sweden and the Riksbank Secondly, I have seen an incipient credibility problem and wanted to formulate monetary policy so that it appears well-balanced even when combined with assessments made outside of the Riksbank. The problems I have seen are based on a combination of inflation having clearly undershot the target, the Riksbank’s inflation forecasts having been more optimistic than those of other analysts, the Executive Board’s repo-rate paths having indicated a tighter monetary policy than the market and analysts have expected and the repo-rate paths having been revised down time after time. I have said that in such a situation it is better to cut the rate immediately rather than continuing to present a repo-rate path that is not perceived by outsiders as entirely credible. However, these problems have become a little less important in recent months as other analysts’ forecasts of inflation and the repo rate have been revised up. Thirdly, it is not self-evident that taking into account household debt means setting a higher repo rate than we would otherwise have done. The current repo rate, 1 per cent, is undeniably low. In the long run, the repo rate will be raised to much higher levels. But we cannot raise the repo rate until we see that inflation has clearly begun to move towards the target of 2 per cent. And when this happens will of course depend on monetary policy. If we cut the repo rate now, inflation will rise faster towards the target. If the repo rate is left unchanged it will take longer before inflation begins to rise, and this in turn means that it will take a long time before the repo rate can be raised. It is not even self-evident that inflation will return to the target level in the long run if monetary policy is too tight. If we are worried that a long period with a low repo rate will give rise to an unjustified upturn in housing prices and indebtedness, we should perhaps ensure we conduct a monetary policy that means we quickly move towards the inflation target, and that still works even if Real interestrate, 1 yearUnemployment012301231213141516CPIF01234012341213141516Repo rateMain scenarioLowerinterestrate-2-1012-2-1012121314151656789567891213141516
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 economic developments are less favourable than forecast in our main scenario. Such a monetary policy could entail cutting the repo rate now to increase inflation and then raising the repo rate slightly faster in the coming period when inflation accelerates (see Figure 7). Admittedly, preliminary assessments within the Riksbank, based on model calculations combined with empirical relationships, indicate that a large repo-rate cut now, followed by faster increases in the future would entail slightly higher risks linked to household indebtedness than if the repo-rate path advocated by the majority is followed. However, the difference in the risk outlook for these two alternatives is almost negligible. A lower repo rate now and faster increases in the coming period seems to me a better monetary policy, when weighing the risks against the opportunity to return to the inflation target sooner and to have a more balanced resource utilisation (see Figure 7).10 The assessments and calculations I refer to here are based on the general framework presented in our Monetary Policy Report published in July.11 It is not entirely clear how this reasoning should be translated into recommendations for practical monetary policy. We are working on this issue within the bank. It scarcely needs to be said that the assessments and calculations I have implied today are uncertain, and that they will remain uncertain even when work on these issues has progressed further.12 Further measures are needed to strengthen financial stability In conclusion, I would like to discuss how the new framework for macroprudential policy affects my view of how monetary policy should be conducted. It is good that one single authority, Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority), is given a clear responsibility for decisions on supervisory measures. In this way, we avoid the problem that different authorities may try to put responsibility on others, which could have arisen if the responsibility was shared between several authorities. At the same time, it is positive that several authorities, including the Riksbank, are given a role to play in the work on macroprudential policy through the new financial stability council. Identifying and analysing factors that can give rise to financial imbalances is and will remain an important part of the Riksbank’s work. The Riksbank needs this analysis for several reasons. As I mentioned earlier, the Riksbank has responsibility for promoting a safe and efficient payment system. We must also understand if monetary policy risks contributing to financial imbalances arising. Moreover, a development of the economy that proves to be unsustainable will affect the way in which inflation develops and what type of monetary policy it is appropriate to conduct. The financial stability council will give us a forum where we can and shall openly present our analyses of financial risks and recommendations for supervisory measures. In the recent Monetary Policy Update our forecasts was based on no new macroprudential policy measures being introduced. But how will my view of a suitable monetary policy be affected if such measures are implemented? The answer depends entirely on the measures implemented and their effects.                                                  10 The scenarios shown in Figure 7 should primarily be regarded as an illustration of the different alternatives. The repo-rate path there does not coincide with the one I have advocated at the monetary policy meetings.  11 The Riksbank (2013c). 12 A central element of uncertainty is how the repo rate affects the degree of household indebtedness. The Riksbank’s estimates imply that the debt ratio will increase when the repo rate is cut, but that the increase will be small. Svensson (2013b) says on the other hand that a lower repo rate would entail a lower debt ratio. But in his model there is no real reason to be concerned over household indebtedness, regardless of how the repo rate affects the degree of household indebtedness. For example, he does not allow for households’ interest-rate expectations becoming unjustifiably low if the repo rate is cut. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches Supervisory measures can have direct effects on financial risks and imbalances by limiting the possibilities of particularly vulnerable households, companies or banks to take certain decisions. However, the measures may also have indirect effects on risks and imbalances, or side effects on the economy by affecting the cost of capital or the general demand situation. An example of a measure that probably first and foremost has direct effects is the mortgage cap. This affects primarily a small group of highly-indebted households and can be expected to contribute substantially to preventing financial imbalances arising. But the mortgage cap scarcely has any major effects on the general demand in the economy, or on the cost of capital for a typical household. An example of a measure that can affect the cost of capital is higher risk weights on mortgages. Such a measure would probably lead to an increase in mortgage rates in relation to other lending rates. And higher risk weights would probably also push up average lending rates at a given repo rate, at least in the short run. As I in practice have not let concern for households’ rapid build-up of debt affect my view of how the repo rate should be set today, measures of the first type, that is, measures that directly limit vulnerable households’ opportunities to become or remain heavily indebted, would probably also have little effect on my choice of repo rate and repo-rate path. On the other hand, measures that entail an increase in the average lending rates or a weakening of general demand would justify cutting the repo rate. The purpose would then be to counteract the effects of the supervisory measure on total economic developments. However, the supervision measures could nevertheless affect financial imbalances, for instance, by changing the level of household mortgage rates in relation to companies’ borrowing rates. Further macroprudential policy measures thus need not change my view of which monetary policy is most appropriate now. However, such measures are nevertheless important to monetary policy as they can reduce risks and uncertainties. It is easier to conduct monetary policy if financial stability is good.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Sayuri Shirai: Monetary policy and forward guidance in Japan Speech by Ms Sayuri Shirai, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the International Monetary Fund, Washington DC, 19 September 2013, and at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington DC, 20 September 2013. *      *      * I. Introduction It is a great honor to have this opportunity to address you today on Japan’s economy and its monetary policy. Since April 2013, when the Bank of Japan introduced quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) that further strengthened existing monetary easing, nearly six months have passed. In these six months, a number of positive outcomes have materialized: these also reflect stimulus measures taken by the Japanese government. Compared with last year, stock prices have been higher; more active transactions are taking place in the financial and real estate sectors; the yen’s exchange rate has been at more depreciated levels; and funding costs for firms and households in the loan and bond markets remain very accommodative. Most importantly, the growth momentum of Japan’s economy is gaining traction – this is evidenced by the positive economic growth rates seen in the last three consecutive quarters (with an annualized real GDP growth rate of 3.8 percent in the second quarter of 2013). The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8 percent in July 2013, approaching the lowest level in recent years of 3.6 percent recorded in July 2007, before the financial crisis. There are some signs of the economy moving out of deflation with the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food, or the core CPI, turning positive at 0.4 percent in June and 0.7 percent in July. Given the amount of global media attention being paid to QQE, it appears that its content is becoming increasingly familiar to many experts and market participants. For this reason, I would rather talk today about QQE from a somewhat different perspective, namely from the standpoint of “forward guidance” – a topic that has been hotly debated globally in recent years. In general, forward guidance refers to communication strategy undertaken by a central bank to provide information to the markets and the public (households and firms) on its future monetary policy stance. Forward guidance is currently used by some central banks in advanced economies facing the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates (hereafter called the zero lower bound) as an accommodative monetary policy. I will begin my speech by explaining why forward guidance is important for Japan in Section II. Section III will focus on general issues related to forward guidance. I will then give my viewpoint on the current practice of monetary policy as adopted by the Bank, compare it with previous monetary policy practices, and highlight some of the ways the practice differs in Japan compared with other economies. Section IV will review QQE progress to date through an overview of current price performance and its outlook, followed by an overview of economic activity. II. Why is forward guidance so important for Japan? I want to first address the question of why forward guidance is so important for Japan. As you know, the Bank is attempting to overcome the mild deflation that has lasted in Japan for nearly 15 years since 1998 and to achieve the 2 percent price stability target adopted in January 2013. The rate of price changes since 1998 is averaged at minus 0.3 percent. Before proceeding with my speech, let me pause here for a moment. I would like to bring up a question that I often encounter abroad. That is What is the problem with having mild deflation in Japan when the unemployment rate has remained so low even throughout the global financial crisis? 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Long-standing mild deflation  It is a legitimate question. It is true that Japan’s unemployment rate has been much lower than that of other economies: the highest level it reached so far during the global financial crisis was only 5.5 percent in July 2009. Certainly, deflation is persistent, but it is mild and has avoided a deflationary spiral. On the surface, therefore, it may be difficult to comprehend Japan’s fundamental problems. My response is normally provided as follows. Mild deflation has been exerting adverse effects on Japan’s economy because it reflects a long-standing negative output gap (chronic demand shortage), low expectations of future economic and market growth by firms, as well as sluggish expectations of future income growth by households (Chart 1). Deflation is also closely associated with the long-term yen appreciation trend that adds to the pessimism of firms already struggling to maintain price competitiveness. These phenomena – together with a decline in total population, the rapid pace of aging of the population, and the slow pace of structural reforms – have discouraged firms from actively engaging in business fixed investment and innovative activities, have led to households saving more because of growing concerns about the future, and have prompted financial institutions to undertake risk-averse investment strategies. In this environment, households take the lower prices of goods and services for granted as they develop a deflation-oriented mindset and thus believe that prices will not increase. In addition, firms follow a deflation-oriented pricing behavior and hence use the sales prices of their rivals and the purchasing behavior of customers to set their prices, even when the supply-demand balance improves. Moreover, financial institutions become increasingly accustomed to deflation-oriented investment strategies, and shift their investments from risk assets (such as stocks, corporate bonds, mutual funds, loans, real estate, and foreign securities) to safer assets (such as Japanese government bonds [JGBs], deposits, and cash). Why was the 2 percent target adopted? As I mentioned earlier, in January of this year the Bank established a target of 2 percent to achieve price stability. I would like to explain here why this course was decided on. In essence, Japan’s economy had been quite depressed and gradually eroding for some time. Given this background the reason for setting the 2 percent target, in my view, is the belief that deflation is more harmful to an economy than inflation, and that it is important to achieve a comparable level of (mild) inflation to that of major advanced economies.1 The Bank’s aim of achieving the 2 percent price stability target is particularly challenging. It implies that the medium- to long-term inflation expectations of both the markets and the public need to be increased and anchored at around the 2 percent level. No other major economies have ever had to face such an undertaking. In more formal economic terms, the important point is that by raising inflation expectations toward 2 percent, the Phillips curve shifts upward and its slope steepens, thereby enhancing the responsiveness of price changes to the supply-demand balance (Chart 2). Forward guidance used for anchoring inflation expectations I stress that “forward guidance” is essential to anchor inflation expectations, particularly in the case of Japan, with its requirement to firmly establish 2 percent medium- to long-term inflation expectations in the minds of the markets and the public. We should note here that the Bank needs to undertake an accommodative monetary policy with two main aims: (1) achieving economic recovery, and (2) anchoring inflation expectations at the target level.                                                 1 See Sayuri Shirai, “Japan’s Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy: Monetary Policy in the Past and Present,” Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Asahikawa, Bank of Japan, 2013. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Contrast this with the situation of other economies’ central banks. Their inflation expectations are already well-anchored at the target level of inflation, and thus, their primary aim is achieving economic recovery (see Section III). In Japan, the second aim of anchoring inflation expectations requires the Bank to first help transform the deflation-oriented behavior of all entities and then to steadily raise their inflation expectations. In this context, the Bank’s task can be considered more challenging than in other economies, and its forward guidance operates under different circumstances. It needs to particularly target price movements and have a stronger commitment regarding monetary easing policies. III. General issues on forward guidance and its implementation in Japan Forward guidance is now a popular topic among the central banks of advanced economies; however, it has been practiced in Japan for some time. Indeed, the Bank was the pioneer in using forward guidance as an accommodative monetary policy tool in the face of the zero lower bound, initiating the practice as early as 1999 when the zero interest rate policy was adopted (Chart 3). Since then, the Bank has come up with various forms of forward guidance at each monetary easing period, as I will later discuss. Moreover, since the onset of the global financial crisis, forward guidance has attracted global attention mainly as a result of its active use by the Federal Reserve under the zero lower bound. It has also recently been implemented as a tool by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BOE), which is discussed in the Appendix to my speech. A. General issues relating to forward guidance The term “forward guidance” is now frequently used by a number of central banks and experts but it appears to have different meanings under different contexts. For clarity here, I assume that forward guidance simply refers to the provision of information by a central bank about future monetary policy to the markets and the public, regardless of whether or not the central bank calls it forward guidance. For example, the Bank does not officially use the term “forward guidance” to describe its communication strategy, but it could be regarded as such. Essentially, forward guidance is aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy. It can be classified into two types depending on the objective. The first objective is to clarify a normal monetary policy reaction function (or the conduct of normal monetary policy) envisaged by a central bank. By contrast, the second objective commits to the continuation of a more accommodative policy under the zero lower bound than would otherwise have been anticipated with the normal policy reaction function. I will further explain these objectives shortly, but one difference between them is that the impacts on financial markets  – such as generating downward pressure on long-term interest rates (and raising asset prices) – are not necessarily intentional and present in the case of the first objective, but are always deliberately pursued as a result of the unconventional monetary policy tool in the case of the second objective. While forward guidance has attracted recent attention for the role it takes in formulating exit strategies from monetary accommodation, as is the case in the United States, my speech today focuses instead on its role in introducing and maintaining a monetary stimulus. Forward guidance to clarify a normal monetary policy stance Forward guidance with the first objective may be regarded as communication strategy by a central bank to inform the markets and the public about the normal policy reaction function of the monetary policy (such as the Taylor rule). This can be classified as “Delphic forward guidance” according to Campbell et al. (2012).2 Forward guidance in this instance can take the form of (1) indirect signals about a future monetary policy stance (for example, about a                                                 2  Jeffrey R. Campbell, Charles L. Evans, Jonas D. M. Fisher, and Alejandro Justiniano, “Macroeconomic Effects of Federal Reserve Forward Guidance,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Spring 2012: 1–54. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  future policy interest rate path) through publishing comments and projections on the outlook for prices and economic activity with risk balance assessments, or it can take the form of (2) direct signals through releasing the future policy interest rate numerical projections. In any case, the future policy stance of a central bank is a forecast based on the currently available information and the normal reaction function. This forecast is updated as new information becomes available. The important point here is that the central bank makes no commitment on its future monetary policy. Generally, this type of guidance is used to enhance transparency and predictability for the markets and the public, so it does not necessarily affect financial markets. Nonetheless, there are some cases where this guidance may favorably influence financial markets. An example of this would be a case where forward guidance results in a clearer understanding by the markets and the public of a central bank’s policy reaction function. They thus adjust their expectations accordingly, even if the central bank’s monetary policy stance is constant. There may also be cases where their better understanding contributes to lowering the degree of uncertainty, and may result in, for example, reducing the volatility of the bond market and term premiums. Finally, there may be instances where the markets and the public believe that a central bank has superior information that can be used for assessing future prices and economic activity. Forward guidance used to signal a more accommodative policy stance The second objective of forward guidance is to signal a more accommodative policy stance. In this instance, it is used as communication strategy for a central bank at the zero lower bound and also as a deliberate additional monetary easing measure, by shifting from the normal policy reaction function. Campbell et al. refer to this type of guidance as “Odyssean forward guidance.” Here the central bank commits to a longer duration of accommodative monetary policy than is generally anticipated by the markets and the public. This commitment to a longer accommodative monetary policy is needed to compensate for the period constrained by the zero lower bound. There has been gradual accumulation of theoretical and empirical analyses on this perspective in the last decade.3 Its most extreme form is an “unconditional commitment” to continue the current monetary easing policy in the future. In other words, a central bank will maintain its already-promised accommodative stance even after economic recovery strengthens and whatever shocks take place in the future. The lower the degree of conditionality, the more effective monetary policy is. However, there is a trade-off between greater effectiveness and higher flexibility regarding the conduct of future monetary policy. In practice, it is not realistic for a central bank to make an extreme unconditional commitment because of the time-inconsistency issues. It is difficult for a central bank to commit to a current accommodative monetary policy in the long term without taking any consideration of the fact that an excessive rise in inflation may dis-anchor medium- to long-term inflation expectations. A similar concern is often raised in relation to the impacts on excessive financial instability and asset price bubbles when a policy of low interest rates is sustained for too long. Therefore, “conditional commitment” or the use of expressions that reduces the degree of commitment is a form generally undertaken by central banks.                                                 3  See, for example, Paul R. Krugman, “It’s Baaack: Japan’s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1998 (2); 137–205; David Reifschneider and John C. Williams, ‘‘Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Era,’’ Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 32 (4) Part 2, 2000: 936–66; Gauti B. Eggertsson and Michael Woodford, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2003 (1); 139–211; and Michael Woodford, “Methods of Policy Accommodation at the Interest-Rate Lower Bound,” Speech delivered at the 2012 Economic Policy Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Open-ended, calendar-based, and state-contingent forward guidance Forward guidance can take various forms. For example, it can be applied solely to the policy interest rate or to a broader set of monetary stimulus measures including the policy rate and asset purchases. It can be categorized as open-ended, calendar-based, or state-contingent (or threshold-based).4 Open-ended guidance can refer to an abstract description of the monetary easing policy duration (such as “a considerable period” or “an extended period”) or of the economic conditions under which the accommodative policy will be maintained (such as “until deflationary concerns are dispelled”). Calendar-based guidance uses specific date expressions for monetary easing, such as “over the next six months.” Some people consider that calendar-based forward guidance is superior to open-ended forward guidance from a transparency and effectiveness perspective. State-contingent guidance provides a clear description of the economic conditions under which the accommodative policy will be maintained by using, for example, a threshold on the inflation outlook. When comparing calendar-based and state-contingent forward guidance, the state-contingent approach is regarded as being superior for two reasons. First, it provides assurance of a central bank’s intention to maintain its accommodative monetary policy even after economic recovery strengthens by introducing such specific expressions in the guidance. Second, a clear description of the relationship between the conduct of future monetary policy and the economic conditions contributes to enhancing transparency and predictability in the eyes of the markets and the public. The major drawback of the calendar-based approach is the difficulty in distinguishing whether an extension of the period for maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy is, for example, (1) the result of more pessimistic forecasts by a central bank on prices and economic activity or (2) the result of a more accommodative policy. The former may discourage aggregate demand while the latter may promote aggregate demand. The state-contingent approach may help to distinguish between these two cases. In relation to economic conditions (or thresholds), forward guidance can focus solely on prices or can include a wide set of economic variables (e.g., the unemployment rate). The different forms here reflect (1) the presence of other mandates given to the central bank, such as the dual mandate in the case of the Federal Reserve; (2) the specific environment surrounding monetary policy at the time (e.g., whether current inflation trends are above or below the inflation target); and (3) the detailed measures adopted (e.g., policy interest rate, asset purchases, or a combination of both). The most important point I wish to highlight here is that the degree of details contained in the description of forward guidance can vary over time. It can be refined over time as economic recovery becomes firm, by giving more specific information about the duration of monetary accommodation or the economic conditions. B. Forward guidance in Japan Let me now focus on forward guidance in Japan. The Bank has a long history of practicing communication strategy to generate monetary easing under the zero lower bound. There are a number of empirical analyses pointing to the effectiveness of this policy in Japan, particularly in regard to the impacts on financial markets.5 Forward guidance also constitutes an important element of QQE. I will first explain the forward guidance used under the current                                                 4  See, for example, Bank of England, “Monetary Policy Trade-Offs and Forward Guidance,” 2013. 5  See, for example, Nobuyuki Oda and Kazuo Ueda, “The Effects of the Bank of Japan’s Zero Interest Rate Commitment and Quantitative Monetary Easing on the Yield Curve: A Macro-Finance Approach,” Bank of Japan Working Paper Series, No. 05-E-6, 2005; Hiroshi Ugai, “Effects of the Quantitative Easing Policy: A Survey of Empirical Analyses,” Bank of Japan Working Paper Series, No. 06-E-10, 2006; and Jouchi Nakajima, Shigenori Shiratsuka, and Yuki Teranishi, “The Effects of Monetary Policy Commitment: Evidence from Time-varying Parameter VAR Analysis,” IMES Discussion Paper Series, No. 2010-E-6, Bank of Japan, 2010. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  QQE, then provide my personal views on the rationale for its structure, followed by a comparison with past measures and other countries’ experiences. Forward Guidance under the Current QQE The Bank released a statement on April 4, 2013, with the introduction of QQE, containing the following two descriptions regarding the time span of monetary accommodation: (1) The Bank will achieve the price stability target of 2 percent . . . at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years (I will call this “the first set of forward guidance”). (2) The Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate (I will call this “the second set of forward guidance”). You might wonder what the relationship between these two descriptions is. In answer to this, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda explained in his speech on April 12, 2013, that QQE included all the necessary measures to achieve the 2 percent target with a time horizon of approximately two years. He stressed, however, that because there is uncertainty in any economy and there is always a degree of latitude in people’s expectations, it was appropriate to state that the Bank would continue with monetary easing as long as it was necessary to achieve the 2 percent target in a stable manner so that everyone was convinced that sufficient monetary easing would be implemented. Thus, these two descriptions are closely connected to reinforce the credibility of the Bank’s commitment to achieving its stated target. I would like to further elaborate on this with my personal view, which does not necessarily reflect the consensus among the Bank’s Policy Board members, focusing on the respective roles of both parts of the released statement as forward guidance. In essence, this unique structure of providing two sets of forward guidance is attributable to the Bank’s challenging tasks of transforming the deflationary mindset and of increasing inflation expectations to anchor around the 2 percent level. The first set of forward guidance was included in the first part of the released statement and was positioned as the rationale for introducing “a new phase of monetary easing both in terms of quantity and quality” (Chart 4). To implement this bold new monetary policy, the Bank decided to shift the main operating target for money market operations from the uncollateralized overnight call rate to the monetary base. Decisions were also made to double the monetary base and the amounts outstanding of JGBs and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in two years by end-2014, as well as to more than double the average remaining maturity of JGB purchases (from less than three years to about seven years). On an annual basis, the monetary base will be increased by about 60–70 trillion yen, JGBs (including those with maturities of up to 40 years) by about 50 trillion yen and ETFs by about 1 trillion yen (Chart 5). In addition, Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) will be purchased at an annual pace of about 30 billion yen over the same period.6 The purpose of this first set of forward guidance was to signal to the markets and the public the Bank’s strong determination to achieve its 2 percent target within a time horizon of about two years, normally pursued by other central banks under the inflation targeting framework. The guidance combines both calendar-based (i.e., about two years) and state-contingent (i.e., 2 percent) features. The calendar-based feature was considered to be essential to gain the confidence of the markets and the public in both the Bank’s intention and the possibility                                                 6  In addition, the Bank will continue the purchases of CP and corporate bonds until their amounts outstanding reach 2.2 trillion yen and 3.2 trillion yen, respectively, by end-2013. Thereafter it will maintain those amounts outstanding. The Bank also flexibly purchases treasury discount bills (T-Bills) and conduct money market operations up to the maximum duration of one year. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  of achieving 2 percent at the earliest possible time. An improvement in confidence may accelerate the pace of increasing the medium- to long-term inflation expectations and may enhance the responsiveness of price changes to the supply-demand balance. The second set of forward guidance was placed under the subheading “the continuation of QQE” in the mid part of the statement. It is a conditional commitment, because the continuation of monetary easing is subject to the examination of upside and downside risk factors (Chart 4). It is also a state-contingent one, linking to the continuation of QQE, and plays a greater role than the first set of forward guidance in stabilizing medium- to long-term inflation expectations at around 2 percent.  As a related issue, the expression “in a stable manner” described in the Bank’s second set of forward guidance may give the impression of a broad description of the conditions. However, I view this expression to be appropriate at present, because the formation of medium- to long-term inflation expectations entails uncertainty. In my opinion, this is especially true when the Bank attempts to raise inflation expectations and subjective judgment by the Policy Board members is unavoidable on whether medium- to long-term inflation expectations will be stabilized at around 2 percent, and when. Additionally, there is no example in other countries where central banks raised inflation expectations, for the Bank to use as a reference. Some measurement constraints also exist, including the fact that (1) there are no precise indicators measuring the inflation expectations of households and firms; (2) statistical bias is included in some survey data – for example, households’ inflation expectations tend to be upward-biased in Japan, while the diffusion index (DI) for expected sales prices in the Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) tends to be downward-biased; (3) in terms of market-based indicators, the impact of the Bank’s JGB purchases needs to be taken into account; and (4) the breakeven inflation rate (BEI) indicator also reflects the differences in liquidity between fixed-rate and inflation-indexed bonds. Nevertheless, as prices and economic activity firmly improve and as the process of increasing inflation expectations becomes clearer, I personally feel that, in the longer-term view points, there may be an opportunity to refine the second set of guidance with more specific information. These two sets of forward guidance are not mutually exclusive, as the first set of guidance can be considered as the “necessary condition” for achieving the second, whereas the second set of forward guidance shows a strong commitment to continue QQE for as long as necessary to stably achieve the 2 percent target (Chart 4). Therefore, while the time horizon of these two sets of guidance overlaps, the second set of guidance may imply a somewhat longer time horizon. In addition, the second set of guidance plays an essential role in reducing volatility of long-term interest rates, and in preventing them from overshooting. In my view, this second set of guidance warrants any necessary actions by the Bank beyond the two-year horizon, if it judges it necessary to do so in light of stably achieving 2 percent. It also suggests that the Bank will not consider an exit from monetary easing before this state-contingent guidance is achieved. Is the bank’s forward guidance open-ended? The BOE referred to the Bank of Japan’s second set of forward guidance under QQE as “open-ended” in its report released August 2013.7 Based on my earlier arguments, this classification is not consistent with my assessment, although I fully respect the BOE’s judgment and analysis. When the two sets of forward guidance are viewed together, my opinion is that the Bank’s forward guidance is multi-layered, largely state-contingent, and focuses on the 2 percent price stability target with a strong (conditional) commitment. The BOE’s conclusion may have been drawn from the fact that only the second set of forward                                                 7  Bank of England, “Monetary Policy Trade-Offs and Forward Guidance.” 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  guidance was referred to in the Bank of Japan’s April 2013 statement under the subheading “The continuation of QQE” and that the expression “in a stable manner” may have appeared qualitative and vague. However, as described above, I feel that the expression “in a stable manner” is appropriate considering the circumstances. C. Clearer and stronger commitments compared with past practices The forward guidance used by the Bank for the current QQE reflects clearer and stronger commitments compared with previous guidance. In the past, the Bank adopted forward guidance at each period of monetary easing: (1) the zero interest rate policy (February 1999–August 2000); (2) the quantitative easing policy (March 2001–March 2006); and (3) comprehensive monetary easing (October 2010–March 2013), as summarized in Charts 6 and 7. First round of forward guidance: 1999–2000  The first round of forward guidance adopted in 1999 was transmitted to the markets and the public in the form of a declaration – rather than a statement – by the then Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami, at a press conference in April 1999, two months after the adoption of the zero interest rate policy. He indicated that he thinks the Bank will maintain the zero interest rate policy until deflationary concerns are dispelled. This could be classified as open-ended forward guidance, linking to the continuation of the zero interest rate policy. However, it has been pointed out that the expression “deflationary concerns” was vague without providing any clear definition of deflation. As a result, this allowed for a wide range of interpretations of and judgments on the exit timing, thereby making it difficult for Policy Board members to make a collective judgment and for the markets and the public to be adequately convinced. For example, while industrial production and exports did improve, the rate of change in the (headline and core) CPI remained negative. Nonetheless, the Bank terminated this policy in August 2000 and raised the uncollateralized overnight call rate to an average of around 0.25 percent, claiming that downward pressure on prices stemming from weak demand had markedly receded. A number of external commentators have expressed the view that the exit timing was too early. Second round of forward guidance: 2001–2006 The second round of forward guidance was adopted when the quantitative easing policy was initiated in March 2001, after the policy rate was lowered to an average of around 0.15 percent in the previous month. Under the policy framework, the Bank shifted the main operating target for money market operations from the uncollateralized overnight call rate to the current account balances held by financial institutions at the Bank. The target amount of the balances was raised nine times from the initial 5 trillion yen (which was higher than the required reserve level of 4 trillion yen) to approximately 30–35 trillion yen in January 2004. The reserve targeting was achieved mainly through relatively short-term money market operations with some purchases of long-term JGBs. The Bank decided that the economic conditions warranted drastic monetary easing. It issued a statement in March 2001 stating that monetary easing would continue to be in place until the core CPI registers stably zero percent or an increase year on year. This was state-contingent guidance, linking to the continuation of the quantitative easing policy. It should be noted that the economic condition used in the guidance was based on the actual performance of the core CPI and was thus clearer than in the earlier zero interest rate policy case. In October 2003, the Bank provided further detailed information on the expression “stably zero percent or an increase” to clarify its commitment for continuing the quantitative easing policy. It refined the expression so that (1) not only that the most recently published core CPI should register zero percent or above, but also that such tendency should be confirmed over a few months, and (2) the prospective core CPI will not be expected to register below zero percent. These conditions were regarded as necessary to terminate the quantitative easing policy, and it was assumed that there might be cases where 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  quantitative easing would be continued even if these conditions were fulfilled. This refined state-contingent guidance applied economic conditions based on both actual and projected price performance. In this circumstance, the core CPI growth rate turned positive in November 2005 (that of the headline CPI turned positive in January 2006). Judging that all the conditions were fulfilled, the Bank terminated the policy in March 2006 by reintroducing the uncollateralized overnight call rate as a money market operations operating target (initially at effectively zero percent). However, these CPI figures were retroactively revised downward and the previously positive figures fell into negative territory in August 2006, when the CPI base year was shifted from 2000 to 2005. The scale of the downward revision was greater than in previous cases and was thus larger than projected. Partly because of this downward revision, there were a number of external views that the exit timing was too early. Third round of forward guidance: 2010–March 2013 The third round of forward guidance was adopted in October 2010, when comprehensive monetary easing was introduced through a virtually zero interest rate policy and the Asset Purchase Program (hereafter the Program). The type of assets purchased under the Program covered JGBs (with remaining maturity from one to three years), treasury discount bills (T-Bills), CP, corporate bonds, ETFs, and J-REITs. The total amount outstanding of the Program was increased gradually from an initial 35 trillion yen to 65 trillion yen at the end of 2012. The amount was scheduled to further expand to 101 trillion yen by the end of 2013 and to 111 trillion yen by the end of 2014. Thereafter, the amount of 111 trillion yen was to be maintained for an undefined period of time. The forward guidance statement indicated that the Bank will maintain the virtually zero interest rate policy until price stability is in sight on the basis of the “understanding of medium- to long-term price stability,” on the condition that no serious risk factors were identified. In addition, “medium- to long-term price stability” was defined as a positive range of 2 percent or lower, with the midpoints of most members’ “understanding” being around 1 percent. This was state-contingent guidance, based on the outlook for prices and linking to the policy interest rate. It was also a conditional commitment, as a risk factor consideration was introduced for the first time as an additional constraint. Importantly, in February 2012, the guidance was further strengthened with the statement For the time being, the Bank will pursue powerful monetary easing by conducting its virtually zero interest rate policy and by implementing the Asset Purchase Program . . . with the aim of achieving the goal of 1 percent. The Bank will continue pursuing the powerful easing until it judges that the 1 percent goal is in sight, on the condition that no significant risk factors were identified. This refined guidance was state-contingent, linking to the maintenance of both the policy interest rate and asset purchases. It was clearer and more powerful than the original one for several reasons. First, it used the word “goal” (which is uniformly set through the consensus of all members of the Policy Board) rather than “understanding” (which was simply a collection of different member views). Second, it clarified that the Bank sets the goal at 1 percent for the time being, while maintaining the medium- to long-term goal within a positive range of 2 percent or lower. However, the drawbacks were that it was not clear whether the Bank was pursing the 2 percent goal or a lower one and how monetary easing was associated with the 2 percent goal.8. Factors leading to the adoption of QQE Taking these drawbacks into account, the Bank finally adopted the 2 percent price stability target in January 2013. The statement it released indicated that the Bank will pursue                                                 8  Sayuri Shirai, “Japan’s Monetary Policy in a Challenging Environment,” Speeches at the Bank of Italy and at the Eurasia Business and Economics Society Conference Held in Rome, Bank of Japan, 2013. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time. Regarding the forward guidance, the statement indicated that the Bank will pursue aggressive monetary easing, aiming to achieve the 2 percent target, through a virtually zero interest rate policy and purchase of financial assets, as long as the Bank judges it appropriate to continue with each policy measure respectively. This was a remarkable leap in the history of the Bank’s monetary policy conduct. Nonetheless, there were some doubts expressed as to whether the 2 percent target would be achievable within the existing monetary policy framework (such as the existing asset purchase schedule and a method to purchase assets without defining the end date, which was scheduled to be introduced in January 2014). These doubts eventually led to the introduction of QQE in April of this year.9 Differences between QQE and past practices In summary, QQE differs from the past practices in the following aspects: (1) a greater emphasis on the expectations of the markets and the public over the future monetary policy stance (this is why aggressive measures and an active use of forward guidance were adopted); (2) recognition of the importance of their medium- to long-term inflation expectations; and (3) larger-scale purchases of longer-term JGBs. Overviewing the Bank’s current and past forward guidance practices, it can be said that both the price stability objective and the related monetary policy conduct are clearer under QQE than in the past (Chart 7). Therefore, the effectiveness of QQE may be greater than that of past practices – mainly through exerting greater downward pressure on the entire yield curve, through stronger impact on the portfolio rebalance and wealth effects, and through indirect impact on the yen’s exchange rate. QQE is also likely to promote an increase in inflation expectations, thereby contributing to lowering long-term interest rates in real terms. D. Forward guidance: Differences between Japan and other advanced economies Next, I would like to make a brief comparison between forward guidance in Japan and that undertaken in the United States and Europe, details of which are included in the Appendix to my speech. I consider that there are two fundamental differences between the Bank’s current forward guidance and those adopted in other advanced economies. Need to anchor inflation expectations at the inflation target First and most importantly, major advanced economies including the United States and the United Kingdom successfully anchored the medium- to long-term inflation expectations at around 2 percent, as opposed to the case in Japan. Central banks in these economies currently hold the view that the expectations remain well-anchored, although there may be some limited concerns on dis-anchoring inflation expectations (downward in the case of the Federal Reserve because of a decline in actual inflation, and upward in the case of the BOE because of a persistent deviation of actual inflation above the 2 percent target). Therefore, the Federal Reserve and the BOE focus on maintaining the anchored inflation expectations, whereas the Bank of Japan focuses on increasing inflation expectations to around the 2 percent target and anchoring them there. This difference is reflected in the design of its forward guidance.  Labor market issues The second difference in Japan’s forward guidance practice in contrast to other advanced economies is that both the Federal Reserve and the BOE have adopted employment-related conditions in their forward guidance, unlike Japan. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of promoting price stability and maximum employment, so the reason for this is clear. The                                                 9  Shirai, “Japan’s Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy.” 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  BOE places price stability as its primary mandate; however, the inclusion of employment-related conditions may reflect the need to clarify the BOE’s views with regard to the existing trade-off between high inflation and low economic and employment growth. In contrast, in Japan the Bank’s primary mandate, clearly stipulated in the Bank of Japan Act, is to achieve price stability. In addition, the current unemployment rate is not a significant issue in Japan. The figure for July 2013 was as low as 3.8 percent (3.3 percent for female workers), with the lowest point in recent years being 3.6 percent in July 2007 (3.4 percent for female workers). Thus, it may not be relevant for Japan to consider introducing economic conditions relating to employment. In general, nominal wage rigidity is limited in Japan compared with the United States and Europe, which partly explains why the unemployment rate remains low. The reason for this is that firms tend to flexibly adjust wages along the business cycle through active use of bonuses for full-time workers, and an adjustment of working hours and days for part-time workers. There are issues such as differential treatments of regular and non-regular workers, and greater flexibility over labor market regulations demanded by firms. However, these are structural issues that are beyond the scope of monetary policy. IV. Price and economic performance under QQE  Overviewing the framework of forward guidance in the context of QQE, you may be interested in its progress to date in Japan. I would like here to quickly review the current performance of prices and their outlook first, followed by the performance of economic activity. Some positive signs observed in prices There are some emerging signs that actual prices have begun to increase (Chart 8). The year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI finally turned positive in June 2013 at 0.4 percent and 0.7 percent in July, after a period of consecutive negative or 0 percent change starting in May 2012. The headline CPI also turned positive at 0.2 percent in June and 0.7 percent in July, following a declining trend since June 2012. This movement reflects higher import prices, improvements in economic activity, and a rise in inflation expectations. So far, the major contribution to this movement comes from an increase in electricity fees and gasoline prices mainly as a result of the increase in import prices driven by the yen’s depreciation, as well as the base effect. However, prices of a wide range of goods and services have also begun to show an increase. Moreover, the consistently-declining trends on durable goods (partly owing to the quality adjustment) appear to be mitigated. This reflects the fact that some large retail stores of home electronics are increasingly shifting from a discount price sales strategy to a higher value-added or higher unit sales price strategy. Some restaurants are also attempting to raise their unit sales prices by providing higher value-added menus and services. Hotel and lodging charges have also shown an increase. Regarding other price indices, the domestic corporate goods price index has already shown an upward trend with a positive year-on-year rate of change for five consecutive months. This is because the pace of transferring higher imported commodity prices onto corporate sales prices tends to be much faster than that of the CPI. It should be noted here that firms are likely to find it relatively easy to pass their increased input costs onto the sales prices in the near future, as compared with the past deflationary environment. The corporate services price index has also recorded a positive year-on-year rate of change for three consecutive months and there are other positive signs such as an increase in the prices of civil engineering and architectural services, hotels, and in leasing and rental. Additionally, land prices in the metropolitan areas recorded a turnaround recently, as evidenced by more active transactions and the resultant increase in residential and commercial land prices (Chart 9). Higher land prices help to improve the balance sheets of firms and financial institutions and the value of collateral, thereby contributing to more active business fixed investment and 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  risk-taking behavior. The unit sales prices of housing have increased recently, possibly contributing to a shift in the deflation-oriented mindset and greater wealth effects. Price outlook and inflation expectations As for the outlook, the CPI performance is expected to improve further; and the price increase contributions arising on the back of improvements in the economy and higher inflation expectations are likely to be greater. Conceptually, the rate of price increase is mainly determined by the supply-demand balance (or the output gap) and inflation expectations. Currently, the output gap measured by the Bank and the Tankan composite indicator (the weighted average of the production capacity DI and the employment conditions DI) remains negative, which suggests that the economy is still operating with large slack. However, these indicators are likely to improve on the grounds of resilient domestic demand and an expected gradual pick-up in overseas demand (Chart 10). Looking at medium- to long-term inflation expectations of market participants, economists, and households, we can see that the indicators are generally rising, but are still well below the 2 percent target (Chart 11). It should be noted that shorter-term inflation expectations tend to be more volatile. They are expected to exceed 2 percent for fiscal 2014 and 2015, if the temporary impact of the scheduled consumption tax hikes is taken into account. It is estimated that an increase in the consumption tax from 5 to 8 percent in fiscal 2014 would boost inflation by about 2 percentage points for fiscal 2014, and an increase from 8 percent to 10 percent from October 2015 would boost it by about 0.7 percentage point for fiscal 2015. Given these estimates, it appears that the short-term inflation expectations have not yet fully incorporated the impacts of the scheduled tax hikes and other impacts (such as higher import prices, and accommodative monetary policy), as shown in Chart 12. There are only very short-term indicators available on the inflation expectations of firms; however, the DI for expected sales prices for the next quarter, as well as the computed sales price inflation expectations, is now showing a rising trend (Chart 13). Higher inflation expectations help to lower long-term interest rates in real terms. Depending on the measures undertaken, some indicators show that the real interest rates may have entered negative territory (Chart 14). This creates a more accommodative financial environment. An increase in inflation expectations may also contribute to promoting current consumption and housing investment. According to the Bank’s baseline scenario, the year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI is projected to reach around 2 percent – the price stability target – toward the latter half of the Bank’s projection period (fiscal 2013–2015). Taking the median price forecast of the Policy Board members, the CPI year-on-year rate of change (excluding the impact of the tax hikes) is expected to reach 0.6 percent for fiscal 2013, 1.3 percent for fiscal 2014, and 1.9 percent for fiscal 2015 (Chart 15). The pace of achieving 2 percent depends on the future movement of the Phillips curve, which appears to remain largely flat at this stage (Chart 16). The closer the medium- to long-term inflation expectations are to the 2 percent target, the larger the shift in the curve (Chart 2). Additionally, the faster the pace of changing the deflation mindset of households and the deflation-oriented pricing behavior of firms, the steeper the curve will become (Chart 2). Because it may take some time before the full impact of QQE via these processes materializes, I consider there may be some degree of uncertainty regarding the duration of achieving the 2 percent target. Gradual rise in economic activity and outlook  The favorable price developments discussed earlier are associated with positive economic activities. Both consumer and business confidence indicators have shown improvement (Chart 17). The high level of consumer confidence reflects the wealth effects driven by higher stock prices compared with last year and steady improvements in employment. This  – together with a front-loaded increase caused by an expected rise in the consumption tax hike scheduled in April 2014 – has contributed to a resilient performance in private consumption and housing investment (Chart 18). Moreover, improved business confidence, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 13  together with an increase in sales and profits, is likely to expand the business fixed investment further as planned by firms (Chart 19). The outlook for the economy is consistent with the outlook for increased prices. According to the Bank’s baseline scenario, the economy is expected to continue a moderate recovery on the back of the resilience in domestic demand and the pick-up in overseas economies. While the economy is likely to be affected by the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the two scheduled consumption tax hikes, it is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate (currently estimated to be about 0.5 percent), as a virtuous cycle of spending, production, and income operates. According to the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts, the real GDP growth rate is expected to be 2.8 percent for fiscal 2013, 1.3 percent for fiscal 2014, and 1.5 percent for fiscal 2015, averaging almost 2 percent (Chart 20). V. Concluding remarks I would like to conclude my speech today by emphasizing that the Bank’s task is not only to overcome deflation by promoting a change in the deflation-oriented mindsets of the markets and the public, but also to anchor inflation expectations at around 2 percent. This is the greatest challenge facing Japan’s economy. To this end, I believe that the Bank’s communication strategy – which in my view is constructed with two sets of forward guidance – is essential to accomplish this task. At the same time, the Bank will do its utmost to revitalize Japan’s economy and achieve sustainable economic growth. Let me also add that the success of the Bank’s monetary policy, QQE, is closely associated with the collective efforts of all entities involved. These include the government in implementing economic growth strategies and credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, firms in actively engaging in innovative activities and enhancing competitiveness, and financial institutions in generating risk money and innovative financial services needed to revitalize Japan’s economy.10 I hope that my speech today was useful in fostering your understanding of the Bank’s monetary policy. Thank you very much for your attention.                                                   10  In this regard, the 2013 Article IV Consultation Report on Japan released by the IMF in August 2013 concludes that the full implementation of structural reforms and medium-term fiscal consolidation, with QQE, may lead to a realization of 2 percent inflation within two years and that this level of inflation can be sustained subsequently. 
14 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Appendix Forward guidance practices in the United States and Europe A. Forward guidance in the United States The 2003–2004 experience In the United States, the Federal Reserve provided forward guidance in 2003–2004, when the economic recovery was weak and unemployment remained high. After lowering the target for the policy interest rate (i.e., the federal funds rate) to the historically low level of 1 percent in June 2003, the Federal Reserve provided forward guidance as a way to generate monetary accommodation. The statement issued in August 2003 indicated that the [Federal Open Market] Committee [FOMC] believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period. This open-ended guidance was meant to signal the FOMC’s intention to keep the low policy rate for a longer period than might otherwise have been expected, to exert a greater effect on longer-term yields.11 This expression was subsequently modified in the statement issued in January 2004, stating that the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation. In May 2004, the FOMC reversed the course with an intention to gradually raise the policy interest rate. The interest rate was subsequently raised 16 times, by 25 basis points each, from June 2004 to June 2006. Forward guidance on the policy interest rate since the global financial crisis Since the global financial crisis onset, the Federal Reserve re-introduced forward guidance and applied it separately to the policy interest rate and to large-scale asset purchases adopted as unconventional measures, after lowering the policy interest rate target range to the lowest rate of 0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008. The descriptive style of forward guidance on the policy interest rate has become clearer and has evolved over time. The Federal Reserve initially started with the statement the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. The open-ended guidance was then replaced in March 2009 with the expression “an extended period,” bearing the nuance of a somewhat longer duration. It was further developed into a calendar-based style from August 2011 with the expression “at least through mid-2013.” It was subsequently adjusted to “at least through late 2014” in January 2012. In September 2012, the date description was modified to “at least through mid-2015.” In addition, the statement included the following description the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. The key here is that the expression “for a considerable time after the economy recovery strengthens” was added to the original description adopted in January 2012. The FOMC viewed that this modified description was consistent with the calendar-based description “at least through mid-2015.” Moreover, Janet Yellen, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, pointed out in November 2012 that the date “mid-2015” is estimated to be later than the liftoff date implied by the normal policy rule (such as the modified Taylor rule). Moreover, this date is estimated to be shorter than, but closer to the liftoff date predicted by the optimal policy simulation (a rule to minimize the deviations of inflation from 2 percent and the deviations of                                                 11  Clemens J.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 15  the unemployment rate from 6 percent with equal weight on both objectives).12 This appears to prove that the monetary easing policy is consistent with the second objective of forward guidance (or Odyssean guidance). The most recent style, which was adopted in December 2012, has been transformed from a calendar-based to state-contingent one. The statement indicated that the Committee . . . currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate [0 to 0.25 percent] will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains about 6.5 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. The FOMC viewed that these thresholds were consistent with the previous calendar date description of “at least through mid-2015.” These thresholds are regarded as a kind of zone of combinations of inflation and the unemployment rate, which is projected to allow the ongoing low levels of the policy interest rate. This guidance also implies that the 2 percent goal is an average concept – not a ceiling – so that the medium inflation outlook could temporarily exceed 2 percent, although the deviation will be contained to ensure that long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. This is a clear signal that the Federal Reserve permits a more accommodative policy to fulfill both its mandates. This latest guidance was apparently influenced by the approach proposed by Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in 2011.13 According to his proposal, the FOMC should state that the low levels of the policy rate would be maintained until the unemployment rate falls substantially to 7 percent as long as the medium-term inflation outlook stayed below 3 percent. Narayana Kocherlakota, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, meanwhile suggested thresholds of 5.5 percent for unemployment and 2.25 percent for the medium-term inflation outlook. Forward guidance on the asset purchase program  Regarding forward guidance on the asset purchase program, the FOMC statement issued in December 2008 pointed out its plan to purchase agency debt and mortgage-based securities (MBSs) using calendar-based guidance with an expression “over the next few quarters.” The subsequent statements continued to maintain calendar-based guidance (such as “this year” and “over the next six months”) every time the Federal Reserve increased its asset purchases including Treasury securities. When the Federal Reserve resumed the purchase of the agency MBSs (in September 2012) and Treasury securities (decided in December 2012 to be introduced from January 2013), forward guidance was shifted from a calendar-based to state-contingent one. In the statement issued in December 2012, the economic conditions for maintaining these asset purchases were described as until such [substantial] improvement [in the labor market] is achieved in a context of price stability. B. Forward guidance in the euro area The Governing Council of the ECB adopted forward guidance for the first time in July 2013. The introductory statement to the press conference indicated that the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation is based on the overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the real economy and                                                 12  Janet L.

This is open-ended guidance, linking to the maintenance of the low policy interest rate (i.e., the main refinancing operations rate, currently set at 0.5 percent). Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, explained that the objective of adopting the guidance was to reassert the ECB’s monetary easing policy.14 He pointed out that the guidance envisages both the first (Delphic) and second (Odyssean) objectives of forward guidance mentioned earlier. It is Delphic because the guidance reveals the ECB’s future monetary policy stance based on currently-available information. It is also Odyssean as it clarifies the ECB’s commitment to the medium-term objective (i.e., below but close to 2 percent) and its determination to apply policy measures if necessary to meet the objective. The ECB’s action reflected concerns that the markets’ expected duration regarding the low interest rate policy had shortened in May 2013 as a result of a change in global financial conditions (largely caused by a rise in U.S. long-term interest rates due to speculation over the timing of “tapering” quantitative easing). This shortening occurred even though the ECB’s assessment of prices and economic activity and its monetary policy inclination remained constant. The earlier-than-projected hike in the interest rate implies a faster-than-projected monetary tightening, which may undermine the economic recovery process. In this sense, the ECB’s action can be interpreted as a provision of monetary accommodation, because it helped lengthen the expected duration of the current interest rate policy by financial markets in line with the ECB’s view. C. Forward guidance in the United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the BOE made a new move in July 2013, although it was not forward guidance describing the future monetary policy stance. After expressing concerns about the significant upward movement in market interest rates, the statement it issued indicated that in the Committee’s view, the implied rise in the expected future path of Bank Rate [the policy interest rate] was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy. Because the statement helped to lower the market interest rates, the effects were similar to those of the ECB. Following a new remit letter from George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in March 2013, the MPC released a comprehensive set of forward guidance over the future conduct of monetary policy in August 2013. The statement indicated that the MPC intends not to raise Bank Rate from its current level of 0.5 percent at least until . . . the unemployment rate has fallen to a threshold of 7 percent, subject to the conditions below. The MPC stands ready to undertake further asset purchases while the unemployment rate remains above 7 percent, if it judges that additional monetary stimulus is warranted. It was also stated that the stock of asset purchases would be maintained until the 7 percent threshold is reached and subject to conditions. The conditions are then defined in the form of the following three “knockouts”: (1) the CPI inflation 18 and 24 months ahead will be above 2.5 percent; (2) medium-term inflation expectations do not remain well anchored; and (3) the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial stability that cannot be contained by the substantial range of mitigating policy actions available to the FPC. If any of these knockouts are breached, the MPC will cease the above-mentioned guidance. It is state-contingent guidance, linking to the policy interest rate, asset purchases and sales. The BOE explained that the objective of introducing explicit forward guidance is to provide greater clarity about the MPC’s views on the existing trade-off between inflation and unemployment and the associated monetary policy stance. Charlie Bean, Deputy Governor                                                 14  Peter Praet, “Forward Guidance and the ECB,” Column published on VoxEU.org, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 2013. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 17  of the BOE, explained in August 2013 that the release of the guidance was to clarify the MPC’s existing monetary policy stance rather than to provide additional monetary accommodation.15.By reducing uncertainty, it aimed at lowering term premiums and preventing upward movements in market interest rates. While the MPC showed that the low policy interest rate is likely to remain throughout the three-year forecast period given the current unemployment rate outlook, there are some views that the possibility of breaching knockouts sooner than this forecast period might have added uncertainty regarding the future accommodative monetary stance.                                                      15  Charlie Bean, “Global Aspects of Unconventional Monetary Policies,” Speech delivered at the 2013 Economic Policy Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 2013.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 William C Dudley: Reflections on the economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at Fordham Wall Street Council, Fordham University Graduate School of Business, New York City, 23 September 2013. *      *      * Thank you, Dean Gautschi, for that kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be here today at Fordham University and I thank the Fordham Wall Street Council for hosting me. This morning my remarks will focus on the U.S. economic outlook.  I am also going to discuss a new tool that the New York Fed will begin to test – an overnight, fixed-rate full allotment reverse repo facility. I want to dispel any misconceptions about why we are doing this testing. The introduction of this facility is not a precursor to a change in the stance of monetary policy. Instead, the goal of this new facility is to improve our control over overnight interest rates to aid us in the implementation of monetary policy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. Let me start by summarizing my main points regarding the economic outlook. In my view, the economy is slowly healing. But, while significant progress has been made since the end of the recession, there remain a number of headwinds that have offset the improvement in the underlying fundamentals. As a result, we have yet to see any meaningful pickup in the economy’s forward momentum.  The most notable recent headwind, of course, has been the large amount of fiscal drag this year from the payroll and income tax increases and the budget sequester. Also noteworthy is the tightening of financial market conditions that has occurred since May. As we move into 2014, the fiscal headwinds should abate somewhat. As that occurs, the improving underlying fundamentals of the economy should begin to dominate, pushing up the overall growth rate.  But this is just a forecast, it has not been realized yet. That is one reason why I supported the FOMC’s decision last week to maintain the current pace of our Treasury and mortgage-backed security purchases. In my view, the economy still needs the support of a very accommodative monetary policy. Adjustments to that policy need to be anchored in an assessment of how the economy is actually performing, how financial conditions are evolving, and how this affects the longer-term outlook and the risks around it. Our decisions on how to adjust our policy tools – for example, the pace of asset purchases and forward guidance with respect to the level of short-term rates – must be rooted in the ongoing flow of information that informs our judgments about the prospects for a sustainable recovery. Decisions on the pace of asset purchase and forward guidance must be based on what is most appropriate to achieve our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment in a context of price stability. Economic outlook Let’s dig a bit deeper into the tug-of-war between improving fundamentals and the drag exerted by fiscal policy and tighter financial conditions.  Starting with the improving underlying fundamentals, one important aspect is the household sector and its balance sheet. In a number of dimensions, households have made significant progress in repairing their finances. Prior to the recession, households took on an excessive amount of debt – much in the form of residential mortgages. The process of deleveraging and reducing this debt overhang is now well advanced. For example, household debt relative to disposable income has declined substantially since it peaked in the third quarter of 2007, 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches bringing it back to levels last seen in early 2003. Delinquency rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards continue to decline. In addition, household wealth relative to disposable income has recovered from the steep decline following the crisis and is now near its 20-year average. Reflecting this improvement, credit standards are beginning to ease, which should support consumer spending on durable goods. Another sector in which the fundamentals have improved is the housing sector. Most importantly, the excess supply of housing created during the boom appears to have been largely worked off. As a result, house prices are now rising in most areas of the country and homebuilding activity has strengthened. Moreover, there is further scope for gains in homebuilding. After all, the current annualized rate of housing starts – around 900,000 – is considerably below the rate consistent with the country’s underlying demographic trends and the expected long-run rate of household formation. By these metrics, housing starts should ultimately climb back to about a 1.5 million annualized rate. The underlying fundamentals supporting business investment are also good. Profit margins have been high and cash flows strong for some time. Credit availability has been gradually improving. For example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicates that banks are continuing to gradually ease their lending standards for commercial and industrial loans.  However, against these improving economic fundamentals, we have two important offsets. The first offset is the unusually high degree of fiscal drag, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates at about 1¾ percent of potential GDP in 2013.1 The two most important components of this restraint are the end of the payroll tax holiday and the increase in income tax rates this past January, and, more recently, the government spending cuts resulting from budget sequestration.  Another new source of drag for the economy is the sharp rise in long-term interest rates, especially residential mortgage rates – that has occurred since May. So far we don’t have much hard data on how this is affecting the housing sector. But data through mid-September generally indicate that the rise in rates has cut into the upward momentum of the housing sector. Currently, improving economic fundamentals versus fiscal drag and somewhat tighter financial conditions are pulling the economy in opposite directions, roughly cancelling each other. The economy continues to grow and payrolls are rising, but there is little evidence of a pickup in the economy’s forward momentum. For example, real GDP growth is still stuck close to the 2.2 percent average annualized growth rate that has prevailed since the beginning of the expansion.  But, as the degree of fiscal drag and other headwinds lessen, the tug-of-war should begin to shift in favor of higher growth. Absent additional fiscal restraint, a further tightening of financial conditions, or some adverse external shock, I expect the economy to grow a bit faster in 2014. So, how compelling is this narrative? In big picture terms, it certainly seems quite reasonable to me. However, no forecast is inevitable and there are some reasons to remain wary. In particular, although the fiscal drag will likely lessen in 2014, I expect it will still be significant, and the outcome of the current federal budget and debt ceiling debates may affect this assessment. Moreover, when one drills down and looks at the recent performance and outlook for the economy’s major sectors, additional caution seems warranted.  Turning first to the outlook for fiscal policy, there are two points worth making. First, the CBO projects that significant fiscal drag will persist into 2014. Second, the fact that the degree of                                                  1  This number refers to the change in the high-employment budget deficit for fiscal year 2013 as estimated by the CBO in March. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 restraint lessens next fiscal year could understate the actual impact on the economy because the full impact of some of this year’s cuts may not yet have been fully felt. For example, consider university research spending that depends, in part, on federal grants. As the grant budget falls under sequestration, this will eventually squeeze university budgets over time and likely lead to additional belt-tightening.  Next, let’s take a deeper look at how the major sectors of the private economy that might play a role in the strengthening story are doing currently: consumption, housing, business investment and trade. When we’re done, I think you’ll agree that there still are some reasons for caution. Turning first to consumer spending, such spending has remained fairly subdued outside of interest rate-sensitive consumer durables. In July, for example, real personal consumption expenditures were flat, and it is unlikely that third quarter consumption growth will be much above a 2 percent annual rate.  Moreover, the drivers of consumer spending do not look particularly supportive. In particular, real disposable income growth has grown at less than a 1 percent annual pace since March. Furthermore, the recent data do not yet clearly indicate a firming in the income growth rate, or the two important components of labor income growth – hours and compensation. The conundrum for consumers is a simple one: if consumer spending growth is to exceed 2 percent annualized on a sustained basis at a time when real disposable income growth is below 2 percent then this would require the household saving rate to decline persistently. But there is little reason to expect such a decline given that the current saving rate is at a level consistent with current level of household wealth relative to income. We have a chicken-egg problem. If the saving rate remains stable, then stronger consumption growth will require a pickup in income growth. But for income to rise, demand must increase. This suggests that there may need to be an impetus to growth from other sectors of the economy to generate a boost in consumer spending growth.  One possible source is the housing sector. As noted earlier, housing starts are still quite low relative to what the country’s demographics should support in the long run. But there are two difficulties here. First, the strength of the housing recovery may be blunted by the recent rise in mortgage rates. For example, before last week’s partial reversal, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate had risen by about 120 basis points since May to more than 4½ percent. For a household considering buying a house and financing the purchase with a $100,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, this rise in mortgage rates would increase their annual payments by more than $800. The increase in financing costs and the rise in home prices has made housing considerably less affordable than it was earlier in the year. This is illustrated by the National Association of Realtors’ affordability index which has declined by 25 percent over the six months ending in July. Second, housing activity has already been contributing significantly to growth. For example, over the past two years, real residential investment swung from a drag of 1.1 percentage points of GDP to a contribution of 0.4 percentage points. Together, this suggests that the impetus to growth from housing may moderate rather than strengthen.  Perhaps, the economy can get a boost from business fixed investment. After all, most of the evidence points towards further improvement. First, as I noted earlier, profit margins and cash flows are high, and credit availability is improving. Thus, those businesses with successful track records should be able to readily finance new investments. Second, business fixed investment is not very high as a share of GDP and overall industrial capacity has been expanding only slowly. This suggests that this sector is not over extended. Third, the drop in U.S. energy costs relative to the rest of the world should spur more investment in the U.S. in energy intensive activities such as petrochemicals manufacturing.  However, there are also some negatives here as well. In particular, despite the positive factors I have cited, the growth in manufacturing output has been only moderate, with the 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches overall manufacturing capacity utilization rate still below its pre-recession level. Thus, outside of the energy intensive sectors, there still appears to be little near-term motivation for firms to invest in order to increase their productive capacity. Businesses seem to be waiting for stronger demand before they significantly increase their investment outlays. Thus, we have a second chicken-egg problem.  On the trade side, the news is mixed. Although Japanese and European economic activity has picked up recently, the sustainability remains in question. Even as Europe emerges from its recession, growth is likely to be anemic at best over the next year, constrained by continued fiscal consolidation and tight credit conditions as their banks continue to deleverage. In Japan, the consumption tax is scheduled to increase significantly next year, which is likely to constrain domestic demand.  Moreover, the recent improvement in Europe and Japan has been offset by slowing in some emerging market economies. In fact, some emerging market economies are under pressure because they are running large current account and trade deficits. Any forced correction among these countries on trade is likely to be a drag on global growth and on U.S. exports over the near term. On balance, my outlook is that growth in the rest of the world will be roughly the same in 2014 as it is this year, so that the contribution of trade to growth will likely remain quite small. Putting all these factors together, I still conclude that there is a basis for a pickup in growth as fiscal restraint lessens, but the impulse is not likely to be a particularly powerful one without some unanticipated impetus to growth that solves the chicken-egg problems, especially in the near term.  On the inflation side of the ledger, inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent longer-run objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator. The year-over-year change in the total PCE deflator was 1.4 percent in July. This has created some concern that inflation is “too low,” raising real interest rates and making monetary policy less accommodative. I acknowledge this concern, but I believe it will abate as inflation moves gradually back up towards a 2 percent annualized rate over the next few years.  A number of considerations inform my view. First, a decomposition of core inflation reveals that the most recent slowing in inflation has been largely confined to core goods, whereas the rate of increase of core services has been relatively steady. Such was not the case in 2010 – the previous instance of a significant slowing of inflation. This suggests that the fall in inflation partly reflects idiosyncratic factors that are not likely to be sustained.  Second, the recent data suggest that the downtrend in the inflation rate may be coming to an end. For example, the core personal consumption expenditures deflator rose at a higher rate over the past three months than during any other 3-month period since mid-2012.  Third, measures of longer-term inflation expectations, whether discerned from financial asset prices or from surveys of households or professional forecasters, remain well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent objective. This is important because inflation expectations are a major determinant of the inflation process. As long as inflation expectations stay well-anchored, it will be hard for inflation to fall further.  Putting these factors together along with my forecast of a gradual pickup in real economic activity, my outlook is for inflation to drift back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term. However, much like the case of the real growth outlook, there is significant uncertainty around this forecast. Monetary policy So what does this all imply for monetary policy? As you are aware, at last week’s FOMC meeting we made no changes to our monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided to continue to purchase long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 at a monthly pace of $45 billion and $40 billion, respectively. The FOMC statement reaffirmed the Committee’s intention “to continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.”2 We also reaffirmed our forward guidance with respect to the federal funds rate. The statement notes that the Committee, “currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”3 Several questions have emerged following the meeting. Most noteworthy was – given that market expectations were skewed towards anticipating the beginning of a taper at this meeting – why the Committee did not begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases. Although I can’t speak for the Committee, I can provide some reasons for my own decision.  To begin to taper, I have two tests that must be passed: (1) evidence that the labor market has shown improvement, and (2) information about the economy’s forward momentum that makes me confident that labor market improvement will continue in the future. So far, I think we have made progress with respect to these metrics, but have not yet achieved success.  With respect to the first metric, we have seen labor market improvement since the program began last September. Over this time period, the unemployment rate has declined to 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent.4 However, at the same time, this decline in the unemployment rate overstates the degree of improvement. Other metrics of labor market conditions, such as the hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate, quits rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate a much more modest improvement in labor market conditions compared to that suggested by the decline in the unemployment rate. In particular, it is still hard for those who are unemployed to find jobs. Currently, there are three unemployed workers per job opening, as opposed to an average of two during the period from 2003 to 2007. With respect to the second metric – confidence that the economic recovery is strong enough to generate sustained labor market improvement – I don’t think we have yet passed that test. The economy has not picked up forward momentum and a 2 percent growth rate – even if sustained – might not be sufficient to generate further improvement in labor market conditions. Moreover, fiscal uncertainties loom very large right now as Congress considers the issues of funding the government and raising the debt limit ceiling. Assuming no change in my assessment of the efficacy and costs associated with the purchase program, I’d like to see economic news that makes me more confident that we will see continued improvement in the labor market. Then I would feel comfortable that the time had come to cut the pace of asset purchases.  A few other points with respect to monetary policy are worth emphasizing following last week’s FOMC meeting. First, as I have noted in earlier remarks, a decision to reduce the rate of asset purchases is not a tightening of monetary policy. If we are purchasing additional securities we are simply adding accommodation at a slower pace.  Second, any decision to cut the pace of asset purchases should not be taken as signaling an early exit from this period of unusually low short-term rates. We have established a threshold of 6.5 percent for the unemployment rate as long as we do not expect inflation to exceed                                                  2  Federal Open Market Committee statement, September 18, 2013. 3  Federal Open Market Committee statement, September 18, 2013. 4  The 8.1 percent unemployment rate refers to the August 2012 unemployment rate that was the latest information available to the Committee at its September 2012 meeting. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches 2½ percent at a one-to-two year horizon and inflation expectations remain well-anchored. It is likely to take a considerable amount of time to reach the 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold. Moreover, because the 6.5 percent unemployment rate is a threshold, and not a trigger, depending on the economic circumstances, we might wait a long time after we breach the threshold before we begin to raise our federal funds rate target.  The point I wish to emphasize is that any decisions on the pace of asset purchases (the rate at which we are adding accommodation) versus liftoff in terms of the federal funds rate (a tightening of monetary policy) should be viewed as largely independent of one another. One does not foreshadow the other – certainly not in any mechanical way or with a definitive timeframe. As Chairman Bernanke noted in last week’s press conference, our actions are data dependent and how the data will evolve is uncertain. In addition, it is worth explaining why we anticipate the federal funds rate is still likely to be quite low relative to what Committee participants consider normal over the longer run, even as the Committee gets close to its employment and inflation objectives. For example, in the September Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 is 2 percent, far below the median long-run federal funds rate projection of 4 percent, at the same time that the unemployment rate and inflation are close to the Committee’s long-run objectives.  How does one explain this? As noted by Chairman Bernanke in last week’s press conference, the still low federal funds rate projections for 2016 reflect the fact that economic headwinds – such as tight credit standards and ongoing fiscal consolidation – are likely to take a long time to fully abate. As a result, monetary policy will have to keep short-term interest rates very low for a sustained period in order for the Committee to achieve its objectives.  My view is that the neutral federal funds rate consistent with trend growth is currently very low. That’s one reason why the economy is not growing very fast despite the current accommodative stance of monetary policy. Although the neutral rate should gradually normalize over the long-run as economic fundamentals continue to improve and headwinds abate, this process will likely take many years. In the meantime, the federal funds rate level consistent with the Committee’s objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability will likely be well below the long-run level. Fixed-rate, full allotment overnight reverse repo facility Before I conclude, I want to discuss a new tool that the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the New York Fed will be testing and developing in coming months. The new tool is a fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight reverse repo facility that would be available to a broad range of counterparties – not just open to the primary dealers through which we have historically conducted our open market operations.5 By being available to a much broader array of counterparties, this should allow the Fed to tighten its control over money market rates. I’ll first explain in plain English what this facility is. Then I’ll explain why we are testing it and what having such a facility in place might accomplish.  A fixed-rate, full allotment overnight reverse repo facility is a facility in which the Federal Reserve posts a fixed interest rate and accepts cash from counterparties, which include banks, dealers, money market funds, and some government sponsored enterprises (GSEs),                                                  5  The Desk has been conducting operational readiness exercises for the use of reverse repurchase agreements since late 2009. At the most recent FOMC meeting last week, the FOMC authorized the Desk to begin another testing program which begins today. See the Desk’s September 20 announcement of the next round of testing. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 on an overnight basis in return for a security. If implemented, the facility would be “full allotment” – that means the facility would have no cap on the amount of funds accepted from any of its counterparties at the posted overnight interest rate.6 The repo facility is “reverse” because the direction in which the funds and securities move – participants are lending funds to the Fed rather than vice versa. Users of the facility are making the economic equivalent of an overnight collateralized loan of cash to the Federal Reserve. The amount of funds invested in the facility is likely to be sensitive to the posted interest rate. The higher the interest rate relative to comparable money market rates, the greater the participation is likely to be and vice versa.  There are several reasons motivating our interest in developing such a facility. First, such a facility should enable the Federal Reserve to improve its control over the level of money market rates. By offering a new, essentially risk-free investment, one would expect that anyone with access to such a facility would generally be unwilling to lend instead to someone else at a rate below that posted for the facility. This should help to establish a floor on the level of overnight rates. Right now, most short-term rates trade between 0 and 25 basis points, but occasionally T-bill and repo rates go negative, for example at quarter-end or when financial stresses increase the demand for very safe assets. The full allotment element of the reverse repo facility would increase the availability of a risk-free asset, satisfying the demand when the appetite for safe assets increases. This should help tighten the relationship between these and other money market rates. These reverse repos would be available to an expanded set of counterparties that includes many of the money market lenders who are ineligible to earn the interest on excess reserves (IOER), such as GSEs and a number of money market funds. Depending on the facility rate, these lenders who cannot earn the IOER rate might get a better rate by investing in the overnight RRPs compared to lending to banks or to broker dealers. This competitive effect could, in and of itself, put a stronger floor on money market rates. Second, this new facility is also likely to reduce the volatility of short-term interest rates. If a lender that cannot earn the IOER rate has an unexpectedly large amount of funds to invest, this lender currently may have to accept an unusually low interest rate. But with the overnight reverse repo facility in place, this lender could lend as much funds as desired to the facility at a fixed rate and this should reduce the downward pressure on money market rates. By tightening control and reducing the volatility of short-term rates, such a facility should reassure investors that the Federal Reserve has sufficient tools to manage monetary policy effectively even with a very large balance sheet. I have told you what this facility is for. Now let me emphasize what the testing and development of this facility does not foreshadow. The testing and the development of the facility is not being undertaken to facilitate or expedite exit from our large balance sheet and should not be considered to be an element of the exit process. The purpose of the facility is to establish a floor on money market rates and to improve the implementation of monetary policy even when the balance sheet is large. Even if our balance sheet increases significantly further and stays very large for many years, it will be useful to have this facility available to improve monetary policy control. In coming months we will test the facility with two goals in mind. First, we want to be assured that there are no glitches operationally with somewhat higher transaction volumes than in previous tests, that we can accept cash from a larger array of counterparties, post collateral in the tri-party repo system and reverse the transactions each day smoothly. Second, while the limited size of the operations during this exercise will prevent the operations from having a significant impact on market rates, we will observe how the facility impacts individual                                                  6  During the testing phase, a ceiling will be placed on the maximum amount that can be invested per counterparty. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches investor demand relative to other market rates. Additionally, we can see how sensitive that demand is to changes in market conditions such as quarter-end that increase the demand for safe assets. These observations will give us some insight into how the facility could affect the entire constellation of money market rates. Only by testing and learning will we be able to assess how best to use the facility.  In conclusion, let me turn back to the economic outlook and the role of monetary policy. I do believe that we are making progress towards our objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. The economic fundamentals are improving and I expect that the healing process will continue in the coming months and years. At the same time, it is important to recognize that the financial crisis generated significant headwinds that are only slowly abating. We must push against these headwinds forcefully to best achieve our objectives.  Thank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Mugur Isărescu: Overcoming economic problems, the experiences of Sweden and Turkey – an inspiration for Romania? Opening speech by Mr Mugur Isărescu, Governor of the National Bank of Romania, at the conference “Overcoming economic problems, the experiences of Sweden and Turkey – an inspiration for Romania?”, Bucharest, 23 September 2013. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Excellences, Distinguished Guests  It is a pleasure for me to welcome you to the National Bank of Romania. I salute the presence of such a distinguished audience: Their Excellences, the Ambassadors of Sweden, Turkey, Brazil, Cyprus, Germany, the Netherlands, members of the diplomatic corps, economists, bankers, businessmen, journalists.  We are honored to host this international conference: “Overcoming economic problems, the experiences of Sweden and Turkey: are these an inspiration for Romania?” The title is, I believe, self-explanatory. In today’s globalized world, learning from other countries’ experience is of utmost importance. And while it might be true that no one really learns but from his own mistakes, one can hope that some other mistakes may be avoided when learning from other people’s experiences.  Why Sweden and Turkey? Before answering this question I wish to emphasize that the National Bank of Romania is open and willing to host other conferences with similar topics. And today’s conference might be considered the first of a series, involving clusters of countries with relevant interactions. With reference to the question above, I can tell you that there have been several reasons to begin with these three countries, but the main reason for which we compare today the present situation in Sweden, Turkey and Romania is due to the diligent and assiduous activity of the Ambassadors of these two countries in Bucharest. Then, I would like to salute their presence here today: His Excellency Mr. Anders Bengtcén, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Sweden, and His Excellency Mr. Ömür Şölendil, Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey and to particularly extend my gratitude to them and to all the persons involved in the materialization of this conference.  I also thank Mr. Klas Eklund, Senior Economist at the Swedish Bank SEB and Adjunct Professor of Economics at the Lund University and Mr. Çağri Memişoğlu, Deputy General Manager at Garanti Bank Romania.  There are, of course, historical links between the three countries. I do take this opportunity to highlight a few of them.  With the Republic of Turkey one could go back to the proclamation of the new state as a republic, last century, and even more, centuries of ties between the Romanian Principalities and the Ottoman Empire. I also like to notice the connection between our two central banks. In the National Bank of Romania’s archives there are letters, exchanged between Governor Mitiță Constantinescu and Governor Salâhattin Çam, regarding the organization of a conference for the governors of the central banks in the Balkanic Coalition, in November 1937, in Ankara. Now, both central banks are members of the Club of Governors of the Black Sea Area. Regarding Sweden I will grasp your attention with a historical moment that incidentally connects Sweden with Bucharest and the Ottoman Empire. One of Bucharest’s landmarks, the Colţei Tower (part of the Colţei Hospital which you can see across the Boulevard) has been built in the early XVIII century by the Swedish soldiers, during King Charles XII retreat to Adrianople after his failed campaign in Russia.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches I will end now my brief journey into history, which has not been nor exhaustive, not even relevant, and get back to our conference topic.  During the debate one should not forget that the size of the economies and the development level is different in these three countries. For example in a list compiled by the International Monetary Fund for the year 2012, Turkey ranks 17th, with a nominal GDP of 795 billion dollars, while Sweden ranks 22th, with a nominal GDP of 525 billion dollars (Romania is 56th, with 170 billion dollars). GDP/capita is also rather different.  I do hope that this conference will elicit a lively debate. I believe that we have much to learn from the Swedish and Turkish experience since they have been market economies for a longer period of time compared to Romania.  I kindly invite Their Excellences the Ambassadors of Turkey and Sweden to address the audience and to introduce their speakers. The debate will be moderated by Mr. Valentin Lazea, the National Bank of Romania Chief Economist.  Thank you for attending this conference, which I do hope will turn out to be a very successful one.   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Michael Gondwe: Facilitating trade and building economies on the African continent Opening remarks by Dr Michael Gondwe, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the African Trade Insurance Agency Workshop for Bankers, Lusaka, 10 September 2013. *      *      * The Secretary General of COMESA, H.E Sindiso Ngwenya;  The Director General of Zambia Development Agency, Mr Andrew Chipwende;  The ATI Chief Investor Relations Manager, Mr Cyprien Sakubu;  The Representative for Zambia, Mr Pizzaro Lukhanda;  Resource Persons;  Distinguished Invited Guests;  Members of the Press;  Ladies and Gentlemen.  It is my honour and privilege to be amongst you all this morning. I wish to express my appreciation to the African Trade Insurance Agency for extending an invitation to me to deliver a keynote address on this important Workshop.  Let me begin by commending the African Trade and Insurance Agency (ATI) for the important role they continue to play in facilitating trade not only in this Country but in the entire Region and indeed the Continent at large. I am no stranger to the role that ATI plays in helping to build economies in the countries that it operates as I have been a client and a supporter of ATI’s products and services in particular in my previous life as Head of the PTA Bank.  I have seen first-hand, the impact that ATI has had in many countries, including in Zambia, where ATI has facilitated trade and investments worth more than $925 million since its inception. I am further informed that ATI has so far this year supported Zambian companies and businesses by offering insurance cover to some very large and essential projects primarily in the energy, mining, manufacturing and agriculture sectors valued at over $726 million. The Agency has also continued to assist many African countries by facilitating foreign direct investments with its political risk insurance that protects investors. Ladies and Gentlemen, the role that trade plays in the economic growth and development of a Country cannot be emphasised. There are many regions and countries of the world that have been able to lift their peoples from poverty to prosperity through trade. However, although Africa in general and Zambia in particular has an economy which is characterized by a relatively high degree of openness, trade has not been utilized to an extent of achieving rapid and sustainable economic development necessary to eliminate poverty.  This failure for trade to serve as a catalyst for sustainable economic development could be attributed in part to the nature of Africa’s export trade which is heavily concentrated on primary commodities that are characterized by relatively slow growth, price instability and long‐term deterioration of terms of trade. The need for African countries and Zambia in particular to participate in the dynamic sectors of global trade such as manufactures and services cannot be over-emphasised. Some analysts have attributed this lack of 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches trade in service and manufacturing sectors to lack of competitiveness and products that insurer the exporter against any unforeseen losses.  The demonstration by ATI of their credit risk insurance products in this workshop will therefore, play a very important role in promoting trade and exports of Non-Traditional Exports which lead to a diversified economy, job creation and sustainable economic growth. The credit risk insurance products also spur trade within Africa by helping our local companies to become more competitive through increased access to credit facilities. ATI has therefore, truly had a significant impact in Africa, which is reflected in the over $10 billion worth of trade and investments it has attracted into the continent over the past decade.  Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, as you are aware, staying competitive is what all companies strive to do. Innovation plays a key role in this equation. I am therefore elated that this morning ATI will speak about how it is providing innovative products and services to better suit the needs of banks and financial institutions. I am confident that the strategic partnerships of local banks and ATI will provide an opportunity for growth in credit particularly to the Small and Medium Enterprises which face major challenges in the trade sector. The Bank of Zambia therefore welcomes this Workshop as it bodes well with our strategic objective of increasing access to financial services to 50% of the population by 2015 from the current level of 37.3%.  As I conclude, I want to assure ATI that the proposal for the Bank of Zambia and all Central Banks in the COMESA Region to relax the capital reserve rules, by considering applying a lower risk weight on transactions that banks and financial institutions have insured with ATI is receiving active consideration within the organs of the COMESA Central Bank Governors. Let me commend ATI for coming up with this innovative initiative which seeks to deepen our financial markets.  Finally, I challenge all of you this morning, especially participants from commercial banks to explore ways on how you can improve your products and services to better serve the entire Zambian population with the products that ATI will present to you this morning.  Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is now my pleasure to declare the African Trade Insurance Agency’s workshop for bankers officially opened and I wish you fruitful deliberations.  I thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yandraduth Googoolye: The role of central banks in encouraging investment in housing Address by Mr Yandraduth Googoolye, First Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the annual conference of the African Union for Housing Finance, Flic en Flac, 11 September 2013. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen A very good morning to you all. It gives me great pleasure to participate this morning in this Annual Conference of the African Union for Housing Finance (AUHF), being organised in collaboration with the Mauritius Housing Company Ltd (MHC). Home ownership is one of the major aspirations of an individual. Today, owning a house not only means having a shelter for the family. The house is a real asset that probably represents the largest investment undertaken by an individual during his lifetime. Such a large sum of money may not initially be readily available for the average individual. It is primarily in this context that housing finance has been linked to the grant of credit facilities by banks and other mortgage institutions. Investment in housing can be seen from different viewpoints. For a Government interested in fulfilling its social mandate of facilitating access to decent housing for low- to middle- income families, the problem is finding the necessary resources to carry out public housing programs. Let me set an aside here to dwell for a minute on the experience of Mauritius where the Government set up as early as 1963 an organism geared towards the provision of social housing. This organism evolved into the Mauritius Housing Corporation (MHC), which is today the only finance institution – both in Mauritius and Rodrigues – that caters exclusively for the promotion of home ownership and the provision of housing finance. Since July 2001, the MHC has been authorised to conduct deposit-taking business to finance its activities and is accordingly under the regulatory purview of the Bank of Mauritius. Over the years, the MHC has been innovative. In addition to credit granted for housing projects, the company also provides architectural, technical, legal, insurance services, and accept deposits primarily for the purpose engaging the general public in savings for home-ownership. More of this will be provided by the Managing Director of MHC. Coming back to my main point, investment in housing, from the perspective of the household, is very often linked to the possibility of obtaining a loan at affordable terms. For the bank manager considering whether to grant a loan, the problem is how to expand the scope of financial services while managing risks appropriately. Finally, from the viewpoint of central banks, the problem is to prevent financial instability and to maintain confidence in the financial system. Today, I should like to take this opportunity to share with you the viewpoint of the central bank and some thoughts on our role in encouraging investment in housing while taking into account the risks that such investment may pose to financial stability. Hopefully, I will be able to contribute towards a deeper awareness and understanding of these risks and other issues linked to housing financing. At least two factors make this a highly topical subject. First, the 2008 global financial crisis has shed the spotlight directly on the housing market, prompting many questions to be raised about practices in housing finance. These questions have challenged traditional assumptions that lending for housing purposes is generally a safe and low-risk activity, and highlighted potential dangers that central banks and banks need to be concerned about. Secondly, the current accommodative stance of monetary policy coupled with the increased competition in 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the housing market calls for greater vigilance by banks in monitoring risks linked with housing loans. In Mauritius, credit for housing purposes has always constituted a large share of total credit to households. Currently, advances granted by banks for housing purposes account for around 62 per cent of total household credit. As a percentage of GDP, housing loans have increased from 7.1 per cent at end-March 2008 to 12.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Latest data show that investment in residential building posted a robust growth rate of 26.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, and it is expected that growth in this segment will hover around 10 per cent in 2013. At the end of the first quarter, the volume of residential building permits increased to 1,724 compared to 1,367 a year earlier. Comparatively, according to the Housing Survey conducted by Statistics Mauritius in 2011, the housing stock grew by 19.9% from 297,700 to 356,900 housing units over the past decade, with the number of private households increasing by 14.5% from 297,900 in 2000 to 341,000 in 2011. While growth in the housing market is expected to be sustained, there is increasing evidence that the rise of investment property has also been important. Housing loans remain relatively sound. However, while house financing is a profitable business for most banks, competition has intensified considerably. Today banks compete aggressively for borrowers by offering highly competitive home loan packages to meet different needs of borrowers. Banks need to be aware of the risks posed by a rapidly expanding housing credit portfolio. The financial crisis of 2008 and its consequences for the world economy serve as a useful reminder of this need. Part of the central bank mandate is to ascertain that, notwithstanding competition and the need to make profits, banks maintain a prudent approach in granting housing loans. At the same time, the regulatory framework set up by the Bank of Mauritius is such that it encourages investment in housing, particularly with regard to first-time buyers. In line with international standards prescribed by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision, credit extended for residential purposes is classified in the preferential bucket of 35 per cent of risk-weighted assets in the computation of capital adequacy ratio requirement. Accordingly, banks are implicitly encouraged to increase the quantum of their portfolio for housing credit given that they maintain lower regulatory capital for holding these assets in their books.  In 2004, a Commission of Inquiry was set up by the Government on the Sale by Levy system in the light of several cases of foreclosures and rising number of lawsuits being filed in court against borrowers whose loans had become non-performing. Subsequently, the promulgation of the Borrowers Protection Act in 2007 came to the rescue and clearly set out the obligations of lenders in providing clear information on the terms and conditions governing the grant of any credit facility, including financing of the acquisition of immovable property. Several measures were taken by the Bank of Mauritius: banks were requested to abide by the provisions of the said Act for all loans, specifically with respect to facilities below the amount of Rs2 million; in view of a closer monitoring of cases being lodged in courts against borrowers, banks were requested to provide information on all cases of Sale by Levy on a periodical basis to the Bank of Mauritius. Presently, the Bank of Mauritius is working on several initiatives that aim at promoting investment by first-home buyers. Macroprudential measures shall shortly become applicable to credit extended by the banking sector for residential purposes, and these policy measures shall include guidelines towards demarcating credit granted for housing purposes and property investment based on speculation and commercial purposes. There is no doubt that making a clear distinction in the terms and conditions applicable for first-house buyers would facilitate the granting of loans. It is also perceived that buying a first house represents a low-risk investment as the collateral for mortgage financing is usually secured by fixed charge on both land and building. However, the Bank of Mauritius has adopted the stance that banks have to maintain sound 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  lending standards in granting credit facilities to the housing sector. While having due regard to the level of household indebtedness at the macro level, the Bank of Mauritius has underlined the need for all financial institutions to undertake proper assessment of borrowers’ repayment capacity. This would prevent households from becoming overleveraged. The Bank of Mauritius further ensures that accurate information is conveyed through advertisements issued by financial institutions to attract borrowers. In this regard, while “teaser rates” for home loans can be conspicuously displayed, the Bank of Mauritius requires that other information, including the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), be displayed as well so that the potential borrower is clearly made aware of the implied interest rate applicable on an annual basis. Conclusion Housing finance contributes significantly in raising living standards of people, be it either in Africa or any part of the world. Viewed at the macro level, housing finance generates economic growth via job creation, entrepreneurship, and economic linkages to other sectors. However, one cannot ignore the fact that the recent financial crisis that rocked the global economy is closely related to a crash in subprime mortgage lending in the United States, the so-called CDS or credit default swap. While taking lessons from the global financial turmoil, the Bank of Mauritius remains committed to its goal of maintaining the soundness and stability of the financial system in Mauritius. Stakeholders should therefore aim at ways to improve access to housing finance in a sustainable way. Ladies and gentlemen, you will concur that affordability remains a major challenge in housing markets in Africa. Several constraining factors such as poverty, lack of long-term financing, reform in land management system, and the rising cost of building materials are issues that remain to be tackled by all delegates present at this conference. However, it is reassuring to note that lenders are becoming more proactive and experimenting with new products, and that housing microfinance is complementing conventional financing methods. Work being undertaken by the African Union for Housing Finance is laudable while aiming to promote housing credit as part of financial inclusion in Africa. I am sure all delegates present here from Africa mainland will benefit from the fruitful deliberations over the next three days and will reach concrete resolutions that shall foster sharing of knowledge and cooperation among members of the African Union for Housing Finance in mobilising funds for shelter and housing on the African continent. I thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Loi M Bakani: Papua New Guinea’s economy and comments on the planned Sovereign Wealth Fund Address by Mr Loi M Bakani, Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, to the 2012 Papua New Guinea Advantage Summit, an International Investment Summit on Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby, 9 September 2013. *      *      * Acknowledgments  The organizers entitled my presentation as “economic briefing” and asked me to touch upon the “Sovereign Wealth Fund”. I will do my best in the time allotted to me, to cover both subjects and more.  I will commence with the subject of Inflation:  As you might know, the Bank of Papua New Guinea’s (the Bank) main role and objective, as is the case with many Developed Countries Central Banks, is “Price Stability”. Only after this objective is achieved, and subjected to it “to promote macro-economic stability and economic growth in Papua New Guinea”. In the last four years 2009–2012, the Bank of Papua New Guinea achieved its primary and secondary objectives, far beyond expectations. Inflation was on the average 6.4% per annum. Given the very high economic growth, as measured by the real increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 9.5% in the same period, the inflation outcome is at the low end of our projections and expectations.  The outcome we are still trying to fully understand is the very low inflation in 2012, of 2.2%. This trend continues in 2013 with inflation of 1.6% in the March quarter and 0% in the June quarter, in spite of the devaluation of the Kina since the last quarter of 2012. In the past, our analysis showed that the devaluation was one of the main causes of inflation. It may seem that the effect of kina devaluation is offset by low imported inflation because of low inflation in our major trading partner countries and slow down in capital inflow, and could be a measurement issue.  At the present the Bank’s projections show that inflation in 2013 will be around 5.5%. The Bank’s assessment and analysis shows that the projection is on the high side. I state with confidence that, “Price Stability”, will be achieved.  The second subject of my presentation is on GDP growth:  As stated above, GDP growth in the last four years was 9.5%. Present projections are for a 5.2% growth in 2013. This projection which, in my view is on the low side, means that in the five years 2009 to 2013 average GDP growth will be 9%. There is no question that it is one of the highest growth rates in the world.  We can without hesitation define Papua New Guinea as a Very High Growth, Small Emerging Market Economy. With the commencement of the operation of the LNG project in 2014, Papua New Guinea has a huge potential to continue and grow at high rates in the future.  Why do I consider the projected GDP growth for 2013 to be on the low side? It will all depend on the implementation of the Government’s Expenditure Plan (Appropriation Act) in the 2013 and future budgets. Based on the fact that the PNG LNG Project construction is scaling down in 2013, and will end in early 2014, the Government decided to present an expansionary budget with a substantial deficit of K2.5 billion or around 7.1% of GDP.  The guiding principles were:  1.  Free education;  2.  Free basic health services;  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches 3.  Infrastructure development;  4.  Rural development projects; and  5.  Law and order.  The overall policy stance of the Government of providing free education, free health that goes hand in hand with clean water and sewerage systems, law and order and infrastructure development is right and commendable. To turn Papua New Guinea from a low income developing economy, to a medium to high income developing one, we will need a healthy and better educated population, in which individual safety and security is granted. For the produce of our rural population to reach the markets, we will have to have usable transport infrastructure of roads, ports and jetties, airports, coastal shipping as well as power and telecommunication.  In this respect the utilization of the machinery and equipment and highly trained man power used to develop the LNG project, for national and rural infrastructure development is a top priority. The Government must take the lead role in the detailed planning, issue of the tenders and awarding of contracts, to ensure that the implementation of these developments are done in the most efficient and productive way.  The allocation of K10 million to each district has to be used to develop the rural infrastructures such as feeder roads, class rooms, health clinics, police stations, while the National Government takes responsibility for the national roads, communication, power, airfields, ports and jetties, coastal shipping and other infrastructure. A combined plan and effort will turn rural Papua New Guinea around, and improve the livelihoods for 80% of the population.  The Government has to plan in great detail and professionally the pace of implementation. The decisions it took are very wide ranging, complex and very costly. It has to ensure that the very large amounts of resources that were allocated to each of the above tasks are used efficiently, and under close scrutiny and control.  The Government is aware that its 2013 expenditure plan can be funded from domestic financial resources. This will result in all of it, excluding some minor import components of fuel, spare parts and some planning will be accounted for as contribution to domestic GDP. If things will materialize as planned, then GDP growth will be substantially higher from the 5.2% projected, and closer to the five year average growth of 9%.  The Government has to plan in great detail and professionally the pace of implementation. The decisions it took are very wide ranging, complex and costly. It has to ensure that the very large amounts of resources that will have to be allocated to each of the above tasks are used efficiently, and under close scrutiny and control.  I recommend that, only after all the plans and safe guards are in place, the resources should be released. Otherwise we will repeat the misallocations and misuse of funds of the recent years from the public funds.  Another policy I advocate from the day I was appointed the Governor of the Bank is the development of the agriculture sector.  Eighty percent of our population are subsisting and earning their living in the formal and informal agriculture sector. We have an abundance of very fertile land, no shortage of water resources, excellent climatic conditions, and many under employed people in the rural areas. Therefore, in the medium term, the industry that can provide a source of income and improve the standard of living, of the great majority of the population is the agriculture sector. The agriculture export industries like oil palm, cocoa, coffee, rubber, tea and coconut are just some of the commodities that, if the right structures will be put in place, they can serve the purpose of providing productive employment and income to the rural majority. Given the world shortage of food and the ever increasing prices of food products in recent years, Papua New Guinea can become the food basket of the Pacific and beyond. The Government 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 should develop an incentive framework that encourages investment in the agriculture sector, to replace imports, enhance and encourage exports of food products.  The most effective way of counter-acting the “Dutch Disease” phenomena is by developing the traditional industries. No question that in Papua New Guinea agriculture will be the preferred industry to concentrate our efforts and focus.  Given that the resources are available, and the production technologies are simple, the development is not hard to come by. Papua New Guineans are farming their land for many generation, and achieving results in agriculture can be realized relatively in a short time. Once the education system will progress and the population’s technical skills will improve, the development of more sophisticated industries can be encouraged and incentivized by the Government.  As requested by the organizers, I will make some short comments on the planned Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). Because of some legislative problems, a new Sovereign Wealth Fund Organic Law was drafted. I am very comfortable with the new Organic Law because it meets the internationally recommended Santiago Principles of Governance and Management.  The objectives as stated in the SWF Organic Law and Act are:  I quote from the new Act;  The objectives for which the SWF is established are that it: (a)  supports the long-term social and economic development objectives of the State;  (b)  provides a means of saving for future generations; and  (c)  facilitates the macroeconomic stabilisation of the Papua New Guinea budget and economy.  These objectives may from time to time be further defined by a Constitutional Law or a Regulation.  I am in full agreement with the funds that will be established:  I quote from the new Act;  The SWF shall comprise: (a)  a Sub-Fund to be known as the “Sovereign Wealth Fund Development Fund”;  (b)  a Sub-Fund to be known as the “Sovereign Wealth Fund Futures Fund”;  (c)  a Sub-Fund to be known as the “Sovereign Wealth Fund Stabilisation Fund;  (d)  a Sub-Fund to be known as the “Sovereign Wealth Fund Management Fund; and  (e)  such other Sub-Funds as may be provided for by a Constitutional Law or by a Regulation.  The funds will be domestically managed and off shore invested. My assessment is that after several iterations we reached a state, in which it will be of great value in stabilizing the economy and preventing the “Dutch Disease” phenomena from occurring, and if it does, to counter act it.  I will touch on two very important initiatives by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. Those are in my domain and very dear to me.  The Bank, in collaboration with the Pacific Financial Inclusion Program, held a two day workshop on the 22nd and 23rd of August to discuss the Financial Service Sector Assessment report. The report identified gaps and issues as to why 85% of the population continues to be unbanked. We are currently formulating the “National Strategies on Financial Inclusion and Education”, with the aim to enable the great majority of the population to be financially literate and included in the formal financial sector. It was decided to establish a 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI) to be the national coordinating agent of all financial inclusion and education initiatives. The CEFI was launched in April 2013 and its mandate approved by the NEC in August 2013.  The Bank will also see to it that the payment system is low cost, efficient and provides all the necessary instruments that an advanced financial system needs. The new National Payment System is at an advanced testing stage and planned to go live toward the end of 2013. The objective is to achieve real time settlement of all payments and transfers carried out by and through the financial system in PNG.  Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ravi Menon: Allianz and Singapore – growing a specialist insurance hub in Asia Opening remarks by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the launch of Allianz’ Regional Centre, Singapore, 18 September 2013. *      *      * Mr Manuel Bauer Dr Dieter Wemmer Dr Maximilian Zimmerer Dr Christoph Mascher Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Good evening. I am pleased to join you this evening at the official opening of Allianz’s new regional centre in Asia Square. Allianz and Singapore This marks a major step forward for Allianz in Singapore and in Asia. For the first time, we will see Allianz’s 450 staff across 11 entities coming under one roof. This new centre will strengthen synergies across business units, enabling Allianz to better serve the needs of its 20 million customers in the region. In a way, Allianz’s story reflects Singapore’s own development as a specialist insurance market. Just ten years ago, the insurance industry in Singapore was focused on writing pure domestic risks. Singapore has now developed the capacity and expertise to underwrite large and complex risks across Asia. With the opening of Allianz’s new office here, Asia Square is also shaping up to be Singapore’s own version of London’s Leadenhall Street, where many prominent insurers and brokers are located. Such physical co-location will help to promote greater exchange of ideas and collaboration, and create an insurance marketplace that is committed to deliver customised and innovative solutions. Mitigating Asian risks The prospects for Asia’s insurance market are bright. A growing middle class and rising affluence will underpin a steady increase in insurance penetration rates. Continued industrialisation, growing trade activities, and infrastructure development will mean greater demand for insurance solutions to mitigate a variety of risks. Over the next decade, insurance business in Asia is projected to grow at about 8% per annum. By 2020, Asia is likely to account for almost 40% of the global market. It is vital that insurers seeking to expand in Asia have a deep understanding of Asia’s risk landscape. Aggregate exposures have grown steadily in Asia, due to rapid urbanisation and economic growth over the last two decades. Asia’s strong record of development means that we have more to lose from unforeseen calamities. Take for example the spate of natural calamities in Asia in 2011. The three costliest events – the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, Thai floods and New Zealand earthquake – caused a combined insured loss of almost US$70 billion. The scale of these losses was unexpected. Thailand had not even been viewed as a catastrophe risk zone, and had in fact been used to diversify against catastrophe risks. These events are a timely reminder to the industry to constantly stay ahead of the risk management curve. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3 + One strategy I understand that Allianz embraces a “3+One” strategy to achieve sustainable growth. In the spirit of this very happy occasion, allow me to adapt your framework to illustrate its relevance to Singapore’s insurance industry as a whole. One, Capacity. Allianz strives to support its businesses with sufficient capacity to underwrite risks. The establishment of the Singapore branch of Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty in 2011 reflects a deep commitment to build underwriting capacity in the Asia-Pacific. In the same way, to be the premier specialist insurance market in Asia, Singapore must deepen its underwriting expertise in reinsurance and specialty insurance with an Asian focus. Two, Profitability. Allianz seeks to be profitable through its operating businesses alone, so as to be as independent as possible from volatility in the financial and capital markets. The global insurance industry continues to face pressure from weak economic growth, soft pricing and persistently low investment yields. Insurers can no longer rely on investment income or rate increases alone, to compensate for weak underwriting. Likewise, even as Singapore’s insurance industry diversifies the span of its activities to include capital markets, it must continue to stay focused on core competencies in underwriting insurance risks. High underwriting standards are critical for sustainable growth. Three, Internal Capabilities. Allianz aims to reduce complexity by focusing on core activities, reducing structural inefficiencies, and streamlining processes. Likewise, in seeking to strengthen its value proposition as a specialist insurance market with a deep appreciation of Asia’s risks, Singapore’s insurance industry must invest in Asia-focussed data, research and analytics. Singapore has achieved a good head-start in a number of areas, such as SMU’s Centre for Silver Security for longevity risk and NTU’s Institute for Catastrophe Risk Management for catastrophic risks. We must continue to build on these capabilities. Finally, +One, Synergistic Growth. Allianz seeks to inculcate systematic cooperation between business lines and markets across the Group to deliver profitable growth. Likewise, Singapore’s insurance market must continue to be underpinned by the strong partnership between industry, academia, and government. Research, talent development and market infrastructure are areas where active collaboration is a critical success factor. Conclusion The commitment of key industry players such as Allianz has been instrumental in establishing Singapore as a leading insurance market. On this happy occasion, we are also pleased to announce that Singapore has been chosen to host the Geneva Association General Assembly in 2015. The General Assembly will bring together global CEOs and other stakeholders in the insurance industry over a two-day conference to discuss industry trends. This is only the second time it will be hosted in Asia, after Japan in 2009. In closing, I thank Allianz for growing with Singapore. I am confident your strong presence in Singapore will serve you well as you continue to extend your Asian footprint. Once again, congratulations, and a very good evening to all of you. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jwala Rambarran: Imperatives for competitiveness and sustainable development Address by Mr Jwala Rambarran, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at the meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce of Trinidad & Tobago, Port of Spain, 8 July 2013. *      *      * At the outset, I thank the American Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to share my views on Trinidad and Tobago’s economic outlook, and to listen to the views of business leaders on imperatives for competitiveness and sustainable development. Such insights feed importantly into the Central Bank’s understanding of the workings of the Trinidad and Tobago economy, and thus into the policy deliberations of the Bank. I strongly believe that, especially in these unusual times, this kind of dialogue with the private sector is critical. I probably do not need to tell anyone in this room that we are indeed living in unusual times. Policymakers around the world have been grappling for the past six years with an economic crisis, which has repeatedly mutated, and it is still not clear what direction the crisis is going to take next. From its origins as a sub-prime crisis in the United States to its morphing into a sovereign debt crisis in Europe, to its current manifestation of fiscal/political gridlocks across both sides of the Atlantic, various measures taken to address each mutation of the crisis have led to unintended consequences. Just about three months ago, the IMF Managing Director was talking about a three-speed global economy in which emerging markets and developing countries were generally doing well, while some advanced economies like the United States were on the mend. Others such as Japan and those in the Euro area still had some distance to travel.  During the last few weeks, sentiment has changed dramatically in global financial markets, again with unintended consequences. Markets overreacted to an earlier-than-expected start to the reduction of monetary stimulus in the United States, even though the Federal Reserve clearly stated that should this commence, it would be done very slowly and would be highly conditional. The surprising intensity of market reaction to the potential end of quantitative easing contributed to a sudden reversal of capital flows in many emerging market economies, sending their currencies tumbling and their stock markets into decline. Such volatility may well signal the start of a new mutation of the ongoing global financial crisis. It may well be a forerunner to the new risks that could materialize when unconventional U.S. monetary policy begins to unwind in earnest. At the same time, it is important to note that many “old” tail risks (low probability, high-impact events) in the global economy – a breakup of the Euro zone, the United States going over the fiscal cliff, a hard landing in China – still remain unresolved. The domestic economy Ladies and Gentlemen, the Trinidad and Tobago economy has weathered the turbulence of the global financial crisis fairly well, but we are yet to experience a sustained recovery from the downturn that started in late 2008. Let me give a brief summary of our current economic position. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Economic growth was considerably weaker-than-anticipated in 2012, as maintenance and safety upgrades at energy companies extended further into the year than originally envisaged, leading to a larger-than-expected decline in natural gas production. The sharp shortfall in natural gas production adversely affected both refining activity and output of petrochemicals. Crude oil production continued its secular decline on account of aging oil fields and lower condensate output. On the other hand, the non-energy sector continued its slow but steady pace of revival, but could not fully offset the contraction in energy output. Accordingly, estimates from the Central Bank’s Quarterly Real GDP Index indicated that the domestic economy grew by a mere 0.2 per cent in 2012. So far into 2013, there are encouraging signs of a gradual recovery. Our preliminary estimates indicate that the Trinidad and Tobago economy grew by 1.7 per cent (year-on-year) in the first three months of 2013. This was the third consecutive quarter of overall economic growth and suggests that some degree of consolidation is taking place, albeit at a gradual pace. As in 2012, the non-energy sector continued to provide support to the overall economy, strengthening further by 2½ per cent in the first quarter of 2013. This marked the eighth consecutive quarter of expansion in non-energy activity. Furthermore, robust growth in local sales of cement, production of mined aggregates and new motor vehicle sales in the first five months of 2013 suggested that the non-energy sector had fully recovered from the negative spillovers associated with last year’s protracted strike in the cement industry. It is also indicative of more broad-based growth in the non-energy sector. On the other hand, like last year, continuing maintenance and security upgrades by energy companies are holding back the energy sector from delivering an improved performance this year. Although there was a marginal increase of ½ per cent in energy sector activity in the first quarter of 2013, following flat output in the previous quarter, growth was still lacklustre. According to the latest labor market data from the Central Statistical Office, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2012 from 5.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2011. More recent data on retrenchment notices suggest that employment conditions may have subsequently deteriorated. Retrenchment notices filed with the Ministry of Labor, Small and Micro-Enterprises increased almost 16 per cent in the first five months of 2013 when compared with the corresponding period in 2012. The central government continues to conduct expansionary fiscal policy aimed at stimulating domestic economic activity. Latest data from the Ministry of Finance and the Economy indicate that the Central Government recorded a deficit of $1.4 billion during the first eight months of Fiscal Year (FY) 2012/2013, compared with a surplus of $1.3 billion for the same period one year earlier. Capital expenditure, which is the main instrument of the government’s investment programme to spur economic growth, reached $3.4 billion and was slightly above levels recorded in October 2011 to May 2012. Unless government significantly picks up the pace of capital spending, its overall budgetary stance could prove only mildly expansionary at the end of the fiscal year, which is just three months away. Provisional data from the Ministry of Finance and the Economy show that gross public sector debt remains within manageable levels. At the end of March 2013, public debt (excluding securities issued for treasury bills and open market operations) increased to 45 per cent of GDP, but still well within the 50 per cent limit considered a prudent debt burden. The increase in public debt resulted mainly from the issuance of bonds to compensate former policyholders of CLICO. I wish to point out that as policyholders convert their bonds to 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  equity holdings in the CLICO Investment Fund, the government can retire this part of public debt, lowering the overall public debt stock. After reaching double digits around the middle of 2012, headline inflation moderated in the latter part of the year, and eased further to around 5½ per cent in May 2013. The slowdown in inflation was largely associated with a steady fall in food price inflation, especially as softening global grain and cereal prices eased the inflationary impetus from abroad. The removal of Value Added Tax (VAT) on selected non-luxury food items in mid-November 2012 had a one-off impact on reducing food price inflation. Core inflation, which excludes food prices, remains low and stable, indicative of relatively subdued demand pressures. Buoyant liquidity conditions, poor credit appetite and the cut in the repo rate have pushed interest rates to historical lows. However, we are yet to see a broader pick up in business lending. Credit granted by the consolidated financial system to the private sector grew slowly throughout 2012 and at a fairly gradual clip of 2–3 per cent in the first four months of 2013. Of concern is that business credit, which showed hopeful signs of recovery in the first half of 2012, has subsequently lost momentum. Meanwhile, we have seen strengthened consumer lending, with increases in borrowing recorded for motor vehicles, home renovation and educational purposes. Even though real estate mortgage lending remains the only credit category demonstrating vibrant double digit growth there is no compelling evidence of overheating in the property market. According to data provided by private valuators, the estimated median price of a typical 3-bedoom today is about 10 per cent lower than the peak in median house prices in early 2012. More importantly, commercial banks have maintained their mortgage lending standards, with still conservative loan-to-value and loan service-to-income ratios. Given the gradual pace of economic recovery and the stability of core inflation, the Central Bank has maintained an accommodative monetary stance. To provide a needed boost to economic activity, the Bank cut its key policy rate, the repo rate, by 25 basis points to a record low of 2¾ per cent in September 2012, following 75 basis points of previous cuts since December 2010. Lethargic credit demand and high net fiscal injections have led to a considerable build up of excess liquidity in the financial system. Commercial banks’ excess reserves held at the Central Bank rose to a daily average of around $5½ billion in the first half of 2013, from a daily average of nearly $4 billion in the first half of 2012. The Bank continues to absorb some of this excess liquidity through open market operations and through requesting commercial banks to roll over maturing holdings of interest-bearing special deposits held at the Bank. Sales of foreign exchange by the Bank also indirectly removed some excess liquidity from the banking system. We also facilitated the issue of a $1 billion, seven-year Treasury Bond in May 2013 to support our liquidity absorption efforts. These Treasury Bonds are purely for the purposes of monetary policy, with the proceeds of the bonds sterilized in a blocked account at the Central Bank on behalf of government. Notwithstanding the gradual pace of recovery, demand for imports of goods and services is quite robust, prompting the Central Bank to intervene consistently in the foreign exchange market. Nonetheless, the country’s gross official reserves remain strong at US$9.4 billion at the end of June 2013, or more than 10 months of import cover. Economic outlook Ladies and Gentlemen, the recent up-turn in domestic economic activity, particularly in the non-energy sector, indicates that economic sentiment is gradually improving and becoming more widespread. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Perhaps the most fundamental downside risk to the country’s improving economic outlook relates to the actions of the two largest natural gas producers (BPTT and BGTT), who are expected to continue major maintenance operations with significant shutdowns scheduled around September 2013. This is a high probability, high impact event. Failure on the part of both the Ministry of Energy and Energy Affairs and these two energy companies to reach agreement on minimizing the very sharp supply disruptions in energy output would throw off track the economy’s current growth mode, resulting in close to zero growth or even contraction for the year as a whole. For its part, the Central Bank has been advancing a financial program of regulatory reform designed to ensure that a crisis on the scale of CLICO never happens again. I am adamant that marauders at the gate can never again breach the regulatory walls of our fortress at great cost to our citizens and to our economy. We are placing top priority on a successful passage of the Insurance Bill 2013, which was recently referred to a Joint Select Committee of Parliament. The Bill introduces best practices in the areas of corporate governance, risk management, consolidated supervision and consumer protection to the insurance industry. Among the measures brought by the Bill will be the strengthening of the powers of the Inspector of Financial Institutions of the Central Bank, which is legally empowered to oversee the operations of the insurance industry and also intervene in the sector where it becomes necessary.  While challenges remain, a final resolution to CLICO’s failure seems to be on the horizon. Such a development should positively impact economic confidence. With firmly anchored inflation expectations, the Central Bank is giving more weight to an accommodative monetary stance until a firm economic turnaround is established. However, should the outlook for inflation, growth, or financial stability change, we will take appropriate action. We are paying close attention in particular to the possibility of normalization of monetary policy in the United States, and the consequent impact on emerging market economies, especially Trinidad and Tobago. Boosting business confidence Ladies and Gentlemen, let me now turn to an issue that I would like to highlight in the context of this morning’s discussion on competitiveness and sustainable development. Many expect central banks to be the ones that can bring back growth. And indeed, over the past few years, the global financial crisis has placed immense demands on monetary policy around the world. In his Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture held at the Bank of International Settlements a week ago, Professor Raghuram Rajan from the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business described the situation quite well: “When the central banker offers himself as the only game in town, in an environment where politicians only have choices between the bad and the worse, he becomes the only game in town.”  But we are not the only game in town. I wish to remind you all that, through its monetary policy, the Central Bank can influence aggregate demand in the economy. But monetary policy cannot solve deeper structural problems or lift the growth potential of the economy. That requires bringing more balance to fiscal policy and speeding up the implementation of structural policies that eliminate supply-side constraints to private investment in the non-energy sector. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  From our frequent conversations with business leaders, we know that one of the most important structural issues facing the Trinidad and Tobago economy at the moment is the need to boost business confidence. Trinidad and Tobago is looking for a return to self-sustaining, self-generating growth. To realize such economic growth we need to see the rebuilding of capacity, through both the expansion of existing companies and the creation of new ones. This calls for stronger confidence among existing businesses and entrepreneurs. We are already seeing welcome signs of such confidence. At one end of the business spectrum, small firms have been mushrooming in various clusters around the country including Charlieville, Felicity, Tunapuna, Sangre Grande, Rio Claro, and Penal/Debe. Some of these small firms are in retail and distribution. Others are in construction and energy services. At the other end of the business spectrum, a few conglomerates have publicly announced major investment projects. These include:  1. A $500 million joint venture between Multicinemas Trinidad Limited and JT Allum Group of Companies to develop the „C3‟ movie and shopping complex in Corinth, South Trinidad. 2. Ansa McAl’s $400 million state of the art clay plant, which is expected to be the single largest investment in the construction this year. 3. A US$600 million joint venture among Neal and Massy, Russian firm Severstal International and Metaldom from the Dominican Republic to build a vertically integrated iron and steel complex on Union Estate, La Brea. 4. Neal and Massy’s Project Development Agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals Company and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to construct and operate plants to produce Methanol and Dimethyl-Ether (DME) at Union Estate, La Brea. The project is expected to cost roughly US$850 million. I commend these business leaders for their vote of confidence in the country’s economic prospects, but it is not enough. We need the entire business community to stop watching and commenting on the game from the sidelines. Ladies and Gentlemen, there is a view that business must stop feeding from government. And business must start feeding government. I remind you of the damning words that Ralph Maraj in his December 31, 2012 column in the Trinidad Express entitled “The Private Sector Can’t Dance” had for the business community: “For the past few years, most of our business elite have been sitting on their resources, marking time but still accumulating; only a few venturing to take some measured risk to stimulate the economy; most waiting, as always, for the treasury to provide new feeding. And they continue to absurdly shout to the government ‘diversify, diversify’, as if they had no responsibility in this critical national need.” Peter O’ Connor in his Sunday June 30 Newsday column entitled “Lacking Leadership” echoed similar concerns. “Which businessman here, with the banking system drowning in liquidity, has the vision and capability to diversify our economy instead of begging government for ‘corporate URP’”? Since the Central Bank is not the only game in town, I take this opportunity to remind the entire business community of their responsibilities and urge them back onto the field. My appeal to you is to take a longer term perspective and invest in people and technology to raise our growth level and to make our growth more inclusive. Play the game passionately, intensely and fearlessly! 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Conclusion In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that Trinidad and Tobago has been navigating well the choppy waters of the global financial crisis, and will continue to do so.  But this is not the message that we seem to be absorbing as a nation. Instead, it is one of a country lurching from one crisis to another. We seem to have a penchant for self-inflicted wounds, looking at our country from the glass is half empty perspective. I appeal to all of us to look at our economy from a glass half full point of view. This is actually not difficult to do. Growth is consolidating, unemployment is low, public debt is very manageable and our citizens still enjoy a high standard of living. The Central Bank is absolutely committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability so firms can make longer-term decisions in an environment of confidence. By explaining the cross-currents at work in our economy, our projections for what’s ahead, and our monetary policy response, we are doing our part to help mend business confidence. We are open to meeting with all business groups to better understand your needs and the support required. I am convinced that we have high calibre business leaders who are smart, professional and innovative. And who are totally committed to this country. You must be the change you want to see in Trinidad and Tobago. I thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yves Mersch: A regime change in supervision and resolution Keynote speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the European Supervisor Education (ESE) Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 26 September 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me to speak today. As you know, Europe has in recent years faced the worst economic and financial crisis since the 1930s. Growth remains weak and unemployment is unacceptably high, with only the first shoots of recovery showing through. Yet out of these difficulties, some positives have begun to emerge. The euro area has recognised that, for its collective stability, it has to deepen integration in certain areas – and it is now beginning to do so. What we are seeing playing out today is not so much the “audacity of hope”, but rather the “audacity of necessity”. In my view, the most significant change taking place is the development of Banking Union. Monetary Union needs Banking Union, not least because a stable banking sector is an essential complement to a sound money. I therefore see the project of building Banking Union as the most important integration step since the launch of the euro. For those of us involved in supervision and other financial sector issues, it is an especially fascinating time. We are at what political scientists call a “critical juncture” – that rare time when a window of opportunity opens to fundamentally redesign institutions. It feels like being back 25 years ago when we were preparing EMU. But this also imposes on us a responsibility. This window may not open again for many years, so we need to make sure that the decisions we take today are the right ones. Most importantly, we need to ensure that Banking Union is not just a label – that it initiates a genuine regime change in the way that banks are supervised and resolved. How to achieve this regime change is what I would like to focus on in my remarks today. The elements of a regime change In my view, a genuine regime change has to involve two elements: first, building a single system for banking supervision and resolution; and, once that is in place, building a stricter system as well. Why do we need both elements? We need a single system to ensure that we have a level playing field for the banking sector across Europe – and hence to create a truly single financial market in Europe. 20 years after the Single Market was supposed to be completed, the banking sector in Europe remains fragmented along national lines. This has many drawbacks, not least that it disrupts monetary policy transmission, makes banks more exposed to country-specific shocks, and encourages home bias in government bond purchases that strengthen the bank-sovereign loop. To give an example of how far short we remain of a fully integrated financial market, a recent study found that, between 2005 and 2012, the average number of bank mergers and acquisitions per year in the United States was 343, whereas in Europe the yearly average was just 58. One reason for this is that we have lacked a single system of supervision and resolution across Europe, which has discouraged cross-border activity. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  We need a stricter system to ensure that, when we have the new tools of Banking Union, they are used proactively – namely, to create a stronger and more stable banking sector. We still have an uphill struggle in Europe to restore investor confidence in the banking sector. And this is partly because we do not have a consistently strict approach to banks – on balance sheet transparency, on loss recognition and on resolution. Evidence of this is the divergence in the price-to-book ratio for large and complex banks in the euro area and outside. For banks outside it is currently around 1, while for euro area banks it is only 0.7 – in other words, euro area banks are priced by the market at less than their book value. An important reason for this is that countries outside the euro area have made much faster progress in acknowledging losses and resolving banks that were not viable. Creating a genuine regime change, both in the system of supervision and resolution and in its application, could therefore have a powerful effect for Europe. In the near term, it could help accelerate the clean-up of banks’ balance sheets and thus restart bank lending. In the medium term, it could help encourage the development of genuinely European banks. So how do we get to this regime change? Building a single system Let me start with the first element, building a single system. In my view, for any system to be single, two conditions have to be fulfilled. First, there needs to be a single set of rules. Second, if those rules contain any discretion, there needs to be a central authority that can enforce them evenly. A single system for supervision For supervision, we are currently making progress on both these conditions. In terms of rules, we now have a new rulebook for banks across Europe as part of the Capital Requirements Directive IV. Within the single supervisory mechanism (SSM), we will also have a single supervisory manual that will apply to all banks. This will cover issues like the methodology for the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), off-site and on-site reviews, risk assessments and model validations. We are thereby ensuring that the same supervisory standards will be applied across Banking Union – and indeed, through harmonisation with the European Banking Authority, across the EU as a whole. In terms of decision-making, we are strengthening the centre by integrating the European and national levels of supervision. A particular innovation here will be the Joint Supervisory Teams, which will contain staff from both the ECB and the national competent authorities. There will be one team for each significant banking group directly supervised by the SSM, operating under the management of a coordinator working for the ECB. This guarantees a collective approach and ensures that there will always be a European element in the decision-making. Indeed, the final responsibility for decisions will rest with the ECB. This process of creating an integrated SSM is of course a major organisational challenge. We are bringing together 17 or more different national supervisors, with different operating cultures and supervisory philosophies, into a single mechanism with a single culture and philosophy. And the ECB will be directly hiring around 1,000 new staff, of which around 750 will be involved in supervision. So it will take time to reach our cruising speed. With the SSM Regulation foreseen to enter into force at the beginning of November, we are ready to publish the vacancy notice for the Chair of the Supervisory Board, followed by those for the top management of the SSM – the four Directors General of the main departments and the six Deputy Directors General. The vacancy notices for the middle management will follow a few weeks later, and then – in accordance with the cascade principle – the broad 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  recruitment will begin. We need to be ready with the basic structure of the organisation for the Asset Quality Review (AQR) towards the end of the first quarter of 2014. Let me therefore briefly take this opportunity to describe how we foresee the SSM’s organisational structure. The SSM will contain four Directorates General and a Secretariat Division. Two of the Directorates General (DGs Micro-Prudential Supervision I and II) will conduct the direct and day-to-day supervision over significant banks. The division of responsibility for supervision between these two departments will be largely determined according to a risk-based approach, allowing them to specialise by risk exposure, complexity and business model of the credit institutions. The third Directorate General (DG Micro-Prudential Supervision III) will host the conduct of indirect supervision over less significant banking groups. Direct supervision of these banks will still be carried out by the relevant national competent authorities (NCA) on a day-to-day basis, but with regular reporting to the ECB. The fourth Directorate General (DG Micro-Prudential Supervision IV) will perform horizontal supervision and specialised expertise functions, such as supervisory quality assurance, methodology and standards development, enforcement and sanctions, crisis management, capital market risk analysis and model validation. Within the organisational set-up, the middle management below the Directors General will encompass Heads of Division and Section and Senior Advisors, from which the Joint Supervisory Team (JST) coordinators will be chosen. Let me also say a few words on how we foresee the practical work and the organisation of the off- and on-site-supervision. The Joint Supervisory Teams (JST) are responsible for the day-to-day supervision of significant banks. They propose inspections, in which they participate without leading the inspections. That task is allocated to the Head of Mission. The Head of Mission is nominated by the horizontal Directorate General, Micro-Prudential Supervision IV – that is, by the ECB. Generally, on-site inspection teams are led by NCA staff. This does not preclude, however, the possibility of the ECB taking the lead. The JSTs prepare the recommendations, lead the closing meeting of the inspection with the credit institution, and provide the follow-up of the recommendations. The horizontal DG is in charge of maintaining the on-site inspection methodology. Moreover, it plans the on-site inspections to be conducted at significant banks on a yearly basis and updates on a half yearly basis the global inspection planning. On-site inspections are specific in-depth investigations of risks, risk controls and governance. They are carried out on the basis of a predefined scope, timeline and resources, and use investigating and inspecting techniques to test controls and substantive procedures, following common standards. They follow specific procedures and are conducted in an independent manner – vis-à-vis the JST, the NCAs and the respective inspected credit institutions. The outcome of on-site inspections will be a report containing findings and an executive summary. A single system for resolution A single system for resolution is just as important as a single system for supervision. Banks need to know how they will be treated both in life and in death – as do the creditors that invest in them. So here again, having a single set of rules and a central authority that can enforce them is essential. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The single set of rules for resolution – the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive – has already been agreed by the Council of the European Union, and discussions are now under way with the European Parliament. In principle, I welcome this Directive as a vast improvement on the status quo. Before the crisis very few countries had resolution frameworks in place, and this has led to ad hoc and inconsistent approaches in different countries. However, where I think this Directive falls short is in the discretion it still allows to national resolution authorities to exempt certain classes of liabilities from bail-in. In my view, this is not conducive to the building of a single system, as it leaves too much uncertainty about how bail-in will be applied. One can imagine a situation, for example, where a particular class of investors is excluded from bail-in owing to national political economy concerns. Or a situation where larger countries with larger resolution funds are in a position to exclude more creditors than smaller countries. Investors will be forced to second-guess these issues. In this context, having an authority that can take central decisions becomes even more important. If there is going to be discretion in how resolution rules are applied, then we need to ensure that this discretion is applied in the same way across different countries. This underscores why a strong single resolution mechanism is so necessary – and, more concretely, why that mechanism has to have independent decision-making powers and no national vetoes. A single resolution mechanism is also essential to ensure that we have a single approach to the resolution of cross-border banks. Dividing resolution along national lines has not proven an efficient way to solve cross-border coordination problems and achieve a least-cost resolution strategy overall. Moreover, in a divided system we can anticipate protracted wrangling over burden-sharing, which only delays the clean-up from a crisis. To address this issue, I see it as essential that the mechanism comprises not only a single resolution authority, but also a single resolution fund. The Commission’s proposal for the single resolution mechanism foresees such a fund, financed by levies on private banks. According to Commission estimates, it will reach a size of about €55 billion by 2025. I welcome this proposal in principle. But I think that, during the build-up phase, clarification is needed on what will happen if there are exceptional circumstances which lead to the fund’s resources being exhausted. The proposal is unclear here. In my view a credible backstop is essential to ensure that resolution costs can be separated from national budgets. To sum up, what defines a single system is having a single set of rules that can be enforced evenly from the centre. We are on the way to achieving this for supervision. I see it as essential that we also achieve it for resolution. Banking Union is ultimately a way of establishing a single financial market where banks are separated from their sovereigns. To paraphrase Mervyn King, we therefore need to ensure that banks are both European in life and European in death. Building a stricter system Let me turn to the second element of a genuine regime change, building a stricter system. Putting in place new rules and institutions for supervising and resolving banks is essential. But it is equally important to use them in a way that leads to a measurably stronger and more stable banking sector. How can we achieve this? 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  A new approach to supervision The first building block is a willingness on the part of policy-makers to make bank balance sheets more transparent according to the common standards of the SSM. The SSM Regulation puts us in a position to do this by requiring a comprehensive assessment of the banks the ECB will directly supervise. This requirement goes beyond a purely accounting exercise. We have to ensure that the assessment is rigorous and managed from the centre. There is no point in having a new pair of glasses if you are not willing to open your eyes. Our current plan for the comprehensive assessment is to have three elements. First, a risk assessment, which will identify broad risk factors, including funding and liquidity risks. Second, a balance sheet assessment, which will review asset quality using calculation, qualification and valuation checks of a broad risk-based nature, with central quality assurance according to a common methodology. This will draw on the expertise of external consultants. Third, a stress test, which will apply the results to an adverse scenario. The linkages between the balance sheet assessment and the stress test still need to be defined in detail. What is clear, however, is that both are communicating vessels. If the former is a more thorough point-in-time stock-taking, then the later has to contain more forward looking elements. As a consequence of this three-pronged exercise, some banks might face capital gaps to close. In our view, it is very important for the credibility of the exercise that the scope of the process remains ambitious; this implies, for example, that a data integrity validation is undertaken. Of course, we need to be alert to the practical concerns of the stakeholders of the exercise, including the banks. It is important that all requirements for the banks are clearly defined, finalised, explained and delivered to them well ahead of the official starting date. Ideally, the final templates, including the accompanying instructions on how to use them, should no longer be altered once data is being compiled for the balance sheet assessment. But we will not compromise on the scope and strictness of the exercise. We would like to launch the exercise, starting with the determination of the risk portfolios, by the end of this year already – although this depends to some extent on when the full Supervisory Board is appointed. I am confident that, once the SSM Regulation has been approved, the ECB and the European Parliament can work in a constructive spirit in appointing the Supervisory Board – in particular in ensuring a fast-track procedure for the appointment of the Chair. When we have the results of the assessment, policy-makers also need to be willing to deal with the consequences. Certainly, European banks are in a stronger position today than they were a few years ago. For example, in Spain banks have provisioned €184 billion euro – that is 10.5% of their loan books – and have raised €22 billion in new equity since 2008. But we cannot rule out the possibility that the exercise will still reveal capital needs. It is essential that there are backstops in place to address this. If the backstops are not there, I fear that the exercise will create a lose-lose situation for the banking sector. If the results reveal only small capital needs, markets will think they have been fudged to save public money. If they reveal significant capital needs, markets will question how they will be filled, creating uncertainty. Either way the confidence boost we hope to gain from the assessment will be lost. A new approach to resolution The second building block of a stricter system involves changing the way in which we deal with non-viable banks. To begin with, we need to make sure that we use the new resolution powers to their full extent. As most European countries do not have much experience with winding down banks, 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  there may be a tendency to avoid putting banks into resolution – by practising supervisory forbearance and allowing banks ever more time to restore viability. The ECB as supervisor has an important role to play here in ensuring that this does not happen. To ensure that resolution powers are used in full, it would also help to have all the elements of the new resolution framework in place at the same time. The supervisory powers of the SSM will apply in principle from November 2014 onwards. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive framework is foreseen to take effect in January 2015, and the start of the single resolution mechanism is planned for the same date. But under the current agreement, the new provisions on bail-in would only be applicable from January 2018. This means that there will be a period of three years where the resolution authority is unable to use one of its key resolution tools. For this reason, I favour bringing forward the entry into force of bail-in. The Directive still has to be agreed with the European Parliament, and in my view we should push for a start date of 2015 for bail-in so that we have the full resolution toolbox available from the outset  – instead of over-extending the State Aid rules as a proxy. Conclusion Let me conclude. What I have tried to illustrate today is that a regime change involves two components. First, the right rules and institutions to ensure a single system. Second, a willingness to use those rules and institutions in a stricter manner. It is therefore a question not only of mechanisms, but also of mindsets. We have already made some encouraging progress, in particular on the SSM. But there is still a long way to go, and success is only possible with a cooperative effort. Whether Banking Union achieves a regime change will ultimately depend on the cooperation and dedication of literally thousands of legislators, regulators and supervisors. It is the very definition of a “team effort”. In the same vein, we need to strengthen our joint training efforts in supervision skills. The European Supervisor Education initiative is an example of a common cross-border approach which could be built upon. Yet in my view Banking Union is the challenge of our times. The crisis has presented us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity: to build a safer banking sector; to strengthen our Monetary Union; and in the process to take forward the historical process of European integration. We are privileged to have this opportunity – and we need to take it. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Vítor Constâncio: Deutsche Bank Prize attribution to Raghuram Rajan Speech by Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Panel on “Liquidity and Monetary Policy” at the occasion of Deutsche Bank Prize attribution to Raghuram Rajan, Frankfurt am Main, 26 September 2013. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to participate in this panel on the occasion of the award of the prestigious Deutsche Bank prize – and, in particular, to be associated with this event honouring the work of Raghuram Rajan.  I became a greater admirer of Raghuram’s work, even if not a wholly uncritical one, after his premonitory paper1 presented at the Jackson Hole central banking conference in 2005. It was a paper I distributed widely to friends and colleagues at the time. But, of course, Raghuram’s previous work was also quite well known – particularly his research on the theory of banking, on bank capital or liquidity risk, and on liquidity creation by banks with the unavoidable financial fragility that this implies2. That research, conducted often with Douglas Diamond, fits well with our panel theme today. Liquidity has been a somewhat elusive concept ever since Keynes defined it in his Treatise on Money in 1930 and Hicks developed it in subsequent work3. Liquidity is a relative concept, a matter of degree, and we all start from Keynes’s definition that one asset has more liquidity than another if it is “more certainly realizable at short notice without loss,” Here, “realizable” means the capacity to be exchanged into narrow money or, even better, into goods and services. Where does the demand for liquidity come from? The need for liquidity does not arise in the perfect and utopian world of general equilibrium with Arrow’s debt contracts or complete calculable contingent claims. Also, as Hicks pointed out, liquidity demand does not appear in traditional portfolio analysis, which he tried to expand by adding a liquidity preference complement. But there are many ways of changing the assumptions of perfect general equilibrium analysis to generate demand for liquidity. For instance, Rajan and Diamond (2001) assume that assets are illiquid and so they “cannot be sold or borrowed against for the full value they generate”4 which implies that there is a demand for liquidity. Jean Tirole and Bengt Holmstrom (2011)5 assume that part of future income stream of firms (and the totality of the households’ income) cannot be pledged, meaning they cannot make their consumption or production plans contingent on contracts that can transfer numeraire from one period to                                                 1 Rajan, Raghuram (2005) “Has financial development made the world riskier?” also as NBER working paper n. 11728. 2 See Rajan Raghuram and Douglas Diamond (2001) “Liquidity risk, liquidity creation and financial fragility: a theory of banking” Journal of Political Economy, Vol 109, no 2 (April 2001) and also by the same authors “Money in a theory of banking” The American economic Review, March 2006, and “Liquidity shortages and banking crises", The Journal of Finance, Vol LX, No. 2, April 2005. 3 J.M.

2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  another. Consequently, they must prepare for financial shocks and reinforce their liquidity position, thus generating a demand for liquidity. These authors distinguish between inside liquidity – created against pledgeable income – and outside liquidity, created by public entities backed by the state capacity to tax present and future income. This refers particularly to central banks, but also to the state budget via deposit guarantee schemes, occasional bailouts or social security programmes. Outside liquidity also includes international cross-border lending.6 Inside liquidity can be excessive, as we saw before the crisis with the expansion of shadow banking and secured lending and repos with repeated re-hypothecation. This is why Adrian and Shin (2008)7 question the relevance of monetary and credit aggregates in representing the overall liquidity situation, a fact that has clear regulatory implications for shadow banks and for the control of leverage. Inside liquidity can also be insufficient, as we saw after the crisis when the chain of inside liquidity creation collapsed, markets froze, fire sales reduced asset values and recession expectations affected estimates of future income. That is when public intervention becomes necessary to substitute at least part of the liquidity needed to sustain the financial sector and economic activity.  There are also other concepts or perspectives on liquidity that have to be considered in order to understand how the term is used – and also because different perspectives are useful for different types of analysis. I mention four in particular: 1. First, macroeconomic liquidity, which refers to broad monetary and financial conditions assessed against some idea about what would be adequate to non-inflationary growth. These can be measured by quantities, like money or credit aggregates growth, or by price, interest rate and the shape of the yield curve.  2. Second, market liquidity, which refers to the easiness to buy or sell in monetary and financial markets without changing the price. This depends on the breadth, depth and resilience of the asset markets. 3. Third, balance sheet liquidity, which means the volume of liquid assets that can be mobilised at short notice. 4. Finally, funding liquidity – the possibility of facing liquidity requirements either from the balance sheet or from committed credit lines. Funding liquidity interacts with market liquidity, as Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2008)8 illustrated for the recent crisis. They demonstrated the existence of liquidity spirals when both types of liquidity are mutually reinforcing. These different concepts are of course all related and are considered in different degrees and forms by monetary authorities. With these definitions in mind, we can now ask ourselves how to assess the present liquidity situation in Europe and the US. Some observers tend to look only at the provision of official liquidity by central banks, and then to claim that “the world is awash with liquidity” or to write that high inflation is around the corner – something that is encouraged by gold bugs.                                                 6 The inside/outside liquidity concepts do not completely overlap with the distinction between private and official liquidity, because outside liquidity at country level includes cross-border liquidity flows which are provided normally by private institutions. 7 See, among other texts, Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2006) “Money, liquidity and financial cycles” Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2008) “Liquidity and Leverage” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports. 8 Markus K. Brunnermeier and Lasse H. Pedersen (2009) “Market liquidity and funding liquidity” The Review of Financial Studies, Vol 22, no 6. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Yet these observers often overlook that we cannot assess in isolation the evolution of the monetary base. Banks are deleveraging and inside and private liquidity are shrinking. This means that credit and money multipliers have collapsed. Indeed, if we look at total liquidity in Europe we see that credit is decreasing and monetary aggregates are increasing now close to nominal GDP.  Regarding price indicators, developments in output, unemployment and inflation in the market of goods and services do not indicate a situation of total excessive liquidity. The ECB’s staff projections estimate inflation for next year at 1.3%, which is below and not very close to 2%. A negative output gap and high unemployment indicate that the full employment equilibrium real interest rate should be more negative, which is impossible to achieve as we approach the nominal zero bound.  So much for the market of goods and services – what about asset markets?  It is true that nominal interest rates have been low for quite a while, which creates some risks for asset markets. We observed, prior to the crisis and during the period of the mislabelled Great Moderation, a disconnect between asset prices and inflation in the market for goods and services. In February this year in a noted speech9, Jeremy Stein raised the possibility of this happening again as search for yield by financial institutions was beginning to affect prices in some riskier asset classes – such as covenant–lite loans, REITs, junk and high yield bonds. What I like in his analysis is that he abandons the textbooks’ fiction that asset prices depend only on the behaviour and preferences of final consumers as investors. Instead, he introduces an “institution-driven” analysis, making prices dependent on the incentive frameworks of managers in searching for yield (and bonus). This is exactly what Raghuram did in his 2005 paper. It is indeed important to consider institutions’ behaviour – think for instance about the structural trend of banks and dealers to reduce their inventories of bonds, and how the consequent reduction of liquidity in the secondary market may affect volatility, overshooting and price spikes. Pointing to the responsibility of low interest rates in creating such incentives, Jeremy asks cautiously: “… would one really want to raise rates, and risk choking off economic activity? Wouldn’t it be better to use a more narrowly focused supervisory or regulatory approach with less potential for damage to the economy?”  Considering the limitations of macroprudential policies in dealing with asset price booms, he did not want to exclude forever the possibility of using monetary policy to help do the job. I too recognise that monetary policy cannot ignore financial stability considerations. In situations of high credit growth that threaten to create asset price bubbles, I have endorsed the possibility of a “leaning against the wind” approach to monetary policy. Excesses in credit, leverage and asset prices invariably lead to crises and endanger medium term price stability.  However, the situation today is different. None of the phenomena identified by Jeremy for the US are really present. Moreover, the institutional changes after the crisis have enhanced the instruments of macroprudential policy and, I am confident, reinforced policymakers’ disposition to apply them. In my view, macroprudential policies must therefore be tried in a serious way, as a priority. We should recognise that monetary policy cannot do everything and is already too much burdened with maintaining price stability, providing adequate liquidity to the banking sector and, in the US, with maintaining low unemployment.                                                  9 Jeremy C. Stein “Overheating in credit markets, origins, measurement and policy responses” February 2013, speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  I consider that in Europe the ECB has been managing liquidity adequately in the pursuance of our goal of ensuring price stability on a medium-term basis – and when that is ensured, catering for financial stability, output and employment. Nevertheless, when risks to inflation subside or disappear, the traditional role of central banks as Lenders of Last Resort (LOLR) tends to come to the fore, and we have to be aware of the moral hazard that this can create – for example banks becoming permanently dependent on central bank money to operate. This consideration adds to the rationale justifying the two liquidity ratios that have been introduced as part of the Basel III agreement, which will make banks better prepared to face liquidity stresses. How has the crisis affected the way the ECB conducts its liquidity operations? In normal times, modern central banks manage their provision of primary liquidity with a view to achieving their target for a short term market rate – normally, the overnight rate. The ECB, like most other modern central banks, conducts monetary policy with mandatory remunerated reserves and a corridor around the policy rate defined by two standing facilities. This means that the signal of one particular policy rate can coexist with different levels of bank reserves – so long as our “liquidity management operations” ensure that the liquidity provided is neither excessive nor insufficient in relation to the demand by profit maximising banks that react to the opportunity cost of reserves. What matters for managing liquidity is the targeted policy rate and the amount of liquidity that is necessary to achieve it. In our case, we keep the banking sector in a liquidity deficit and supply liquidity via lending to the banks through a system of auctions. Other central banks supply liquidity mostly through outright purchases of securities, normally short-term government paper. Both models of liquidity provision have changed during the crisis. In the case of the US, the Federal Reserve started to buy longer maturities and some private paper. In our case, in October 2008 we abandoned the system of auctions with variable rates and entered a mode of fixed rate, full allotment – supplying as much liquidity as banks’ demanded, provided they had eligible collateral to pledge. On top of this, in December 2011 and February 2012, we launched extraordinary operations with 3-year maturities that totalled 1 trillion euro. The net increase in our monetary base was around 500 billion euro as banks reduced their use of shorter maturity facilities.  Our particular method of supplying primary liquidity makes the future absorption of liquidity in excess of the minimum reserve requirements easy to achieve. Banks have to repay what they have borrowed when maturity is reached. In reality, as their situation has improved, they are anticipating the repayment of the LTROs. They have repaid 362 billion euro (or 64% of the net increase of 500 billion euro) and excess liquidity, which reached a peak of 813 billion euro in March 2012, has now fallen to 218 billion euro. We have been exiting quietly and smoothly from an extraordinary phase of high central bank liquidity provision.  However, this new mode of conducting monetary policy also presents challenges. As the overnight market rate is determined by the volume of excess liquidity and the size of the corridor between the policy rate and the deposit facility rate, it is more difficult to influence its level – and correspondingly, to influence other short term money market rates. For instance, if excess liquidity keeps declining, as determined by the banks, there may be pressure on short rates to increase.  To this picture we also have to add the international dimension – notably the risk of spillovers from the US. We already saw that the announcement of a tapering of outright purchases resulted in higher money market rates in Europe. In this overall context, we decided to introduce an important change in our policy, announcing a form of forward guidance. We stated that we will keep our key interest rates at 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  present or lower levels for an extended period of time, dependent on our assessment of medium-term prospects for inflation. It should be noted that, although compatible with our monetary policy framework, this represents a real innovation in our instruments. It is conditional, it has a negative bias and this forward guidance will change only when we change our assessment of the impact of economic and monetary conditions on inflation prospects. The new policy has already produced visible effects: the whole forward curve of euro rates up to two years came down immediately after our announcement. Although it has in the meantime increased somewhat, it remains stabilised at levels lower than we saw before our announcement. For the future, we are as usual data-dependent – but if declining excess liquidity were to put undue upward pressure on short-term rates, we would have to address this problem. We still have several policy instruments available in our toolbox and will use them as needed. We will continue to manage liquidity conditions so as to maintain a stable monetary and economic environment that ensures our main goal of medium-term inflation below but close to 2%.  Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Barry Whiteside: Celebrating the Fijian entrepreneurial spirit Opening address by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the launch of the 2013 Fuji Development Bank Small Business Awards, Suva, 14 August 2013. *      *      * Ratu Deve Toganivalu Executives and Staff of Fiji Development Bank Fellow Sponsors Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen Introductory comments Bula vinaka and a very good morning to you all. Thank you, Ratu Deve, for your kind invitation to launch the 2013 FDB Small Business Awards. It is another significant event on the business calendar where we recognise the achievements of the private sector, and in this particular case, small businesses in Fiji. These Awards were conceived around the idea of the need for us all to stop what we are doing and salute those small businesses doing great things for our country. Let us not only celebrate the winners, but also all the others that have dared to back their entrepreneurial spirit and set up a business. We trust that this event will create the necessary awareness out there of these “mum and dad” type enterprises. We hope that this will further encourage them to grow from strength to strength to become much larger businesses in the future. There are of course many examples we can cite of large successful Fijian companies that started from virtually nothing. The small business awards Today is actually the 10th anniversary of the FDB’s Small Business Awards and I am honored to be here to share this achievement with you. I applaud the Fiji Development Bank for organising this competition over the years. The fact that it has been sustained shows FDB’s commitment and energy towards growing the Fijian economy by assisting the small players, particularly, in providing them with access to credit. One of the major challenges of small businesses is who will give them the money to start and sustain their initial operations? The winners I have been informed that this year there are seven award categories: – agriculture, tourism, wholesale & retail, professional & business services, manufacturing, a best business practice award and a special award. That pretty much covers everything. Ladies and Gentlemen, in as far as gender balance goes when it comes to small businesses, women are clearly the driving force. Unfortunately they beat us men “hands down”. Last year’s awards saw women entrepreneurs win five of the seven awards. As a man, this is always a difficult and painful one to explain as it is not only Fijian men that suffer our well known “malua” fever, but this is a larger phenomenon across the globe. Studies actually show women entrepreneurs conducting small businesses are the driving force and are, by far, more successful than men – and, dare I say it, with such empowerment at this level, they are said to contribute more to GDP. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Indeed there is one micro finance institution operating in Fiji, and in other parts of our Pacific region, that will only lend to the ladies, for the very reason that women are more likely to pay back the loans with interest! South Pacific Business Development currently has nearly 3,900 lady clients under its Fijian micro loan portfolio and a repayment rate in excess of 95 percent. Clearly we men need to step up to the plate and be counted. So, while I am not a judge for the awards, (and I would not wish to influence anyone), hopefully we may see a change this year when the prizes are handed out – if just to prove all those studies wrong! It would be remiss of me not to mention a great example of one of our small businesswoman entrepreneurs who is riding the path of success. Makereta Matemosi was the overall winner of the 2007 Fiji Development Bank Small Business Awards. A $35 manual sewing machine was her initial investment. She started sewing bags using mats as the base material. Then the opportunity from the makers of Mokosoi products gave her a break – she was asked to make traditional packs for their products. With product engineering, masi was blended with the mat bags. With three more electric sewing machines donated to her, her business flourished and she was able to attract more orders from as far as New Zealand. The assistance from her community also assisted her in the production process so that she was able to meet her customers’ orders. Today, Makareta’s masi designs are recognised internationally – her masi design is Fiji Airways’ brandmark. It epitomises Fiji and enhances the new name of our national carrier. The new symbol in the brandmark brings Fiji’s culture and heritage to life by linking the name “Fiji Airways” with this highly respected and traditional art form that has been a part of Fijian culture for several centuries. From humble beginnings, Makareta has shown us that there is light at the end of the tunnel and if you persevere, work hard and believe in your dreams, everything will turn out right, eventually. I have no doubts that she will move on to bigger things and I wish her the success she obviously deserves! Assistance to small businesses It is my view that the formal financial sector needs to be a bit more accommodative in granting access to small businesses. The FDB’s Small Business Awards cover businesses with a turnover of between $30,000 and $100,000. However, there are also those that have a lower turnover that need finance to start up. Money is not the only ingredient required for successful businesses. They need assistance with business acumen and good governance principles. Training, coaching and mentoring, including complying with the laws, are huge challenges. The Government in its 2012 National Budget Address introduced the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme with the aim of encouraging and supporting small and medium sized local businesses, particularly by improving private sector lending in their direction. Under this Scheme, Government will provide a guarantee for up to 50 percent of the outstanding principal amount of any defaulted SME business loans, up to a limit of $50,000 per business. Interest charged on such lending must not be higher than 10 percent per annum. The fact that the lending institutions no longer have to cover the total risk should make it easier to lend and our latest data shows this to be the case with 338 SMEs already qualifying through the commercial banks since the Scheme’s inception in January 2012. These businesses have managed to borrow a total of $18.8 million and to date there have been no failures or calls reported on the guarantee. Ladies and Gentlemen, the RBF Board at its June 2013 meeting approved a reduction in the RBF advance rate to lending institutions under its Import Substitution and Export Finance Facility (ISEFF) and Natural Disaster Rehabilitation Facility (NDRF). Licensed credit institutions, commercial banks and the Fiji Development Bank are now able to access ISEFF 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and NDRF funding from the Reserve Bank at 1 percent per annum compared with 2 percent previously. They on-lend these funds to eligible businesses up to a maximum of 5 percent. Together the Fijian Government and the RBF have been building an enabling and supportive environment that is conducive to economic growth for the business community. RBF monetary policy continues to be accommodative towards growth. The Fijian economy Before I close, I would just like to provide a brief update for you on the positive news about the Fijian economy. Growth this year is estimated at 3.2 percent, the highest since 2004. This compares with our earlier forecast of 2.7 percent. The 2013 growth rate is broad based with positive contributions from all sectors, except for mining and quarrying. The revised growth projection for 2013 reflects a growing optimism in the economy and is consistent with the strong growth in various partial indicators, for example, net value added tax collections, inward remittances, domestic cement sales, and borrowing by the private sector for consumption and investment purposes. The surveys conducted by the RBF – Business Expectations and Retail Sales Surveys – together with direct feedback from industry groups and the private sector, echo many positive sentiments as well. Investment as a percentage of GDP is estimated at 28 percent in 2013, above the Government’s target of 25 percent. The growth forecasts for 2014 and 2015 have also been revised upwards. Official launch Ladies and Gentlemen, in concluding, let me also thank all the sponsors for their valuable contributions towards these Small Business Awards. The Reserve Bank has been a sponsor since the inception of the Awards in 2004 and we intend to continue supporting small businesses. We will be recognising micro businesses and their contributions later this year at a separate ceremony. I take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to the contenders of this year’s competition – you are all winners in my eyes. Hibiscus is just a few days away and we hope that everyone will visit the RBF’s Financial Inclusion Village at Albert Park to learn more about financial literacy, capital markets, and also support the micro entrepreneurs who will be selling their wares. Once again, thank you for the kind invitation to share in the launch. I now have much pleasure in officially launching the 2013 Fiji Development Bank Small Business Awards. Vinaka vaka levu. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yoshihisa Morimoto: Economic activity and prices in Japan and monetary policy Speech by Mr Yoshihisa Morimoto, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Iwate, 29 August 2013. *      *      * I. Recent financial and economic developments and price developments A. Overseas developments 1. Overseas economies First, I will talk about key developments in overseas economies that are likely to affect the outlook for Japan’s economy. With the recovery in the U.S. economy starting to clearly gain hold, overseas economies as a whole are gradually heading toward a pick-up, although a lackluster performance is partly seen. As for the outlook, overseas economies are likely to start recovering, albeit at a moderate pace. However, amid sluggish growth in emerging economies, the pace of recovery is expected to remain moderate on the whole. I will now consider each region in more detail. 2. U.S. economy Despite downward pressure from the fiscal side, the U.S. economy has been on a moderate recovery trend against the backdrop of steady private demand. As for the employment situation, total nonfarm payroll employment has been increasing by almost 200,000 a month, and the unemployment rate has been on a downtrend. In the household sector, although the tax increase at the beginning of the year continues to have an effect, with the employment situation following an improving trend and asset prices rising, household spending, including private consumption and housing investment, has been firm. Taking a look at the corporate sector, business sentiment has been improving on the back of firm private demand, although the pick-up in production has been moderate partly reflecting a large cut in government expenditures. For the time being, close attention needs to be paid to fiscal issues  – particularly the federal debt ceiling problem – and developments in financial markets as well as their effects on, for instance, housing investment. If household spending continues its uptrend, however, this could lead firms to gradually become more proactive, thus strengthening the recovery momentum of the economy as a whole. Furthermore, the benefits of the shale gas revolution could help boost economic activity, mainly by reducing the volume of crude oil imports, lowering energy prices, and increasing business fixed investment in related sectors. 3. Euro area economy In the euro area, with the European debt problem dragging on, an adverse feedback loop among the fiscal situation, the financial system, and economic activity has taken hold  – particularly in peripheral countries – and economic activity has receded slowly. Looking at unemployment rates, these range from as low as 6–7 percent in Germany to as high as 26 percent in Spain, indicating widening regional disparities in business sentiment. Recently, however, there have been gradually growing signs of a bottoming out. Business and consumer sentiment in the area – including peripheral countries – is improving in a situation where financial markets have stabilized somewhat and the European authorities have modified their stringent fiscal consolidation plans, temporarily easing the measures. Exports are also bottoming out, and GDP growth for the April-June quarter turned positive for the first time in seven quarters. With these developments continuing, the euro area economy is likely to bottom out and head toward a pick-up. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  4. China’s economy With regard to emerging economies, the Chinese economy continues to see stable growth against the background of firm domestic demand, as evidenced in particular by stable private consumption reflecting a favorable employment and income situation and by rising fixed asset investment, which is growing at a year-on-year rate of about 20 percent. Nevertheless, China’s economic growth rate has been at a relatively low level of around 7.5 percent. Underlying this are the structural reforms that the Chinese authorities are engaged in, which emphasize quality-based growth and lowering income disparities. Specifically, one area of focus is measures to curb the excess production capacity and the rapid expansion in credit accompanying the 4 trillion renminbi stimulus package implemented in the wake of the global financial crisis. The so-called shadow banking system is another focal point. The Chinese authorities are proceeding with policy responses to contain the risk of an overly rapid credit expansion through banks as well as non-banks. As a result, total social financing – a measure of aggregate credit supply to the economy mainly consisting of loans and corporate bonds – has been increasing at a slower pace. Although these structural reforms tend to restrain growth, the authorities have also made clear that they will remain vigilant regarding economic growth, stating that they will fine-tune policies in a timely manner to achieve a growth rate of about 7.5 percent for 2013. With the authorities aiming for well-balanced, sustainable growth, the Chinese economy is likely to continue growing steadily at the current pace. 5. Uncertainties regarding overseas economies Uncertainties in overseas economies that require careful monitoring include (1) the effects of speculation about the direction of U.S. monetary policy on financial markets and on emerging and commodity-exporting economies, (2) developments in the Chinese economy, and (3) the prospects for the European debt problem. In the United States, the Federal Reserve’s tapering of its asset purchases has become a matter of discussion. The background to this is the moderate but steady recovery in the U.S. economy, and this recovery itself is a positive development for the world economy. Furthermore, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has repeatedly conveyed the message that it will begin to adjust the pace of its asset purchases only when there continues to be substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. Although this stance of the Federal Reserve is gradually being understood in the market, market participants have in some cases withdrawn funds from markets in emerging and commodity-exporting economies in anticipation of an eventual tapering of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, and the risk of similar responses in the future remains. The world economy’s momentum for recovery is still weak, and there is high uncertainty regarding the possible effects on financial markets and economic activity in the event of a rapid outflow of funds. As for the Chinese economy, a key point of focus is whether it will be able to maintain stable growth. Specifically, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, in grappling with various challenges such as overcapacity in the manufacturing sector and income disparities to achieve stable growth, the authorities can restrain credit expansion, such as in the shadow banking system at a pace exceeding economic growth, while steadily proceeding with structural reforms and rebalancing the economy from investment to consumption. Uncertainty regarding the European debt problem remains, even though the extreme tail risk of a potential disintegration of the euro, which some had feared at one time, has receded. However, market tensions could rise yet again if efforts to strengthen economic and financial union of the euro area and to push through fiscal reforms are seen to be in retreat. Political developments in euro member countries warrant vigilance, starting with the outcome of the German federal election scheduled in September. Geopolitical risks, particularly in the Middle East, also require close attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  B.  Japan’s economy and prices 1. Current state of and outlook for Japan’s economy I will now explain the current state of, and outlook for, Japan’s economy given the overseas economic developments I have just outlined. Japan’s economy was relatively weak in the second half of 2012 as exports and production decreased mainly reflecting the deceleration in overseas economies, which in turn adversely affected domestic demand such as business fixed investment in the manufacturing sector. Economic conditions, however, have become favorable since the beginning of 2013. Recently, domestic demand, in particular public investment and private consumption, has been firm, exports have been picking up in a situation where overseas economies are gradually heading toward a pick-up, and industrial production is increasing moderately. Against this backdrop, the June 2013 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) showed a significant improvement in business sentiment not only in the manufacturing sector, which has greatly benefited from the correction of the yen’s appreciation, but also across a wide range of other sectors including nonmanufacturing, as well as upward revisions in firms’ business forecasts such as with regard to profits and fixed investment. Taking into account that the level of economic activity had been rising moderately and a virtuous cycle from income to spending had gradually started operating, the Bank of Japan, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 10 and 11, 2013, raised its basic assessment of the domestic economy, from the assessment that the economy “has been picking up” to the assessment that it “is starting to recover moderately.” As for the outlook, exports are expected to increase moderately, mainly reflecting the pick-up in overseas economies and the correction of the yen’s appreciation. As for domestic demand, public investment and housing investment are expected to continue trending upward, business fixed investment is projected to increase moderately reflecting the improvement in corporate profits and the employment situation, and private consumption is expected to remain resilient. In this situation, industrial production is also expected to increase moderately, judging from interviews with firms and other relevant information. Against the backdrop of these developments in demand both at home and abroad as well as in production, Japan’s economy is expected to recover moderately. Let me elaborate on these developments for a moment. Due in part to the correction of the yen’s appreciation and the rise in stock prices since the end of 2012, business and consumer sentiment has improved, and this improvement is likely to help underpin private consumption for the time being and gradually entice firms to increase their spending. Increased private consumption is particularly evident among the middle-aged and the elderly, who hold more stocks than other age groups. Consumption activity of the baby-boom generation is expected to remain firm due to their higher propensity to consume than other generations and to firms’ efforts to capture new demand. Meanwhile, business fixed investment is projected to increase moderately, mainly due to the resumption of postponed investment for the maintenance and replacement of items such as machinery and to investment related to disaster prevention and energy. Upward pressure on the economy from the public demand side is expected to gather full momentum as seen in the fact that the value of public works contracted, a leading indicator of public investment, has already increased significantly. The key to ensuring that this trend toward economic recovery continues and to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) is that improvements in business performance lead to increases in employee income. Looking at the recent employment and income situation, supply and demand conditions in the labor market have improved, as evident in the unemployment rate and the active job openings-to-applicants ratio, and the year-on-year rate of change in the number of employees has been positive. In this situation, despite the downward pressure resulting from the uptrend in the ratio of part-time employees, the year-on-year rate of change in nominal wages per employee has turned slightly positive, with special cash 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  earnings for June – which include summer bonus payments – showing an increase for the first time in three years. While uncertainty regarding the outlook remains, the Bank would like to confirm whether these developments also lead to a rise in scheduled cash earnings. Keeping these points in mind, I would like to summarize the outlook for Japan’s economy for the next three fiscal years. While the economy will be affected by the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the two scheduled consumption tax hikes, it is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential, as a trend, as a virtuous cycle among production, income, and spending is maintained. In the Bank’s interim assessment in July of the April 2013 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter the Outlook Report), the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts for the economic growth rate is a somewhat high 2.8 percent for fiscal 2013 due to the effects of various economic measures and the front-loaded increase in demand, 1.3 percent for fiscal 2014 partly due to the subsequent decline in demand, and 1.5 percent for fiscal 2015. 2. Prices Next, I will talk about price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) had been in negative territory through April 2013, but has recently turned positive for the first time in 14 months, partly reflecting the correction of the yen’s appreciation. Energy prices including those for petroleum products and electricity have been rising, and increases in the costs of raw materials have started to be passed on to sales prices of, for example, foodstuffs. Sales prices of some imported consumer goods such as personal computers and handbags have also been raised. Recently, there have been more signs of a change in firms’ price-setting behavior, including the introduction of higher-end products and services in some areas within the food service industry. Under these circumstances, firms’ forecasts for supply and demand conditions and prices in the June 2013 Tankan have clearly improved. As for the outlook, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to rise, reflecting factors such as the improvement in the aggregate supply and demand balance due to the recovery of Japan’s economy as well as the rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations in response to fundamental changes in the public’s expectations. The rate of increase in the CPI is likely to reach around 2 percent – the price stability target – toward the latter half of the projection period, spanning from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2015, as the overall economy improves in a balanced and sustainable manner. Specifically, in the Bank’s interim assessment in July of the April 2013 Outlook Report, the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts for the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food; for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes) is 0.6 percent for fiscal 2013, 1.3 percent for fiscal 2014, and 1.9 percent for fiscal 2015. II. Conduct of monetary policy A. Introduction of “Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing” (QQE) 1. Framework of QQE Next, I would like to turn to the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy. In order for Japan’s economy to overcome deflation as early as possible and achieve sustainable growth with price stability, the Bank introduced in January 2013 the price stability target of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. It concurrently released a joint statement with the government, in which the government and the Bank clearly acknowledged the role each had to play and stated that they would work together to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth. Then, in April, the Bank introduced QQE to achieve the price stability target at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years. This policy measure represents a considerable departure from the Bank’s previous practice both in terms of quantity (the size of increase in the amount of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  currency provided by the Bank) and quality (the type of assets the Bank purchases to increase the amount of currency). Specifically, the Bank decided upon the following. First, with a view to pursuing quantitative monetary easing, the Bank changed the main operating target for money market operations from the uncollateralized overnight call rate to the monetary base, which is the sum of banknotes in circulation, coins in circulation, and current account deposits held by financial institutions at the Bank. On this basis, the Bank will increase the monetary base at an annual pace of about 60–70 trillion yen, thus doubling it in two years. Second, the Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen. As a result, the amount outstanding of JGBs held by the Bank is likely to more than double in two years. Moreover, the Bank extended the average remaining maturity of its JGB purchases from slightly less than three years to about seven years. It should be noted that in practice the average remaining maturity is subject to fluctuations, depending on bids by financial institutions; thus, it is appropriate to allow for a range of about six to eight years. And third, the Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen and about 30 billion yen, respectively. The Bank will continue with QQE – consisting of these measures – aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate. In order to achieve the price stability target, it is important to create a virtuous cycle in which prices rise moderately along with a balanced and sustainable improvement in economic activity that is accompanied by increases in corporate profits, employment, and wages. Furthermore, in order to fully ensure the effectiveness of monetary easing, it is important for the government to ensure market credibility of fiscal consolidation. Japan is facing serious fiscal imbalances, and if the credibility of its fiscal management were to decline, long-term interest rates would likely rise in a manner inconsistent with economic and price developments. The government indicated in the joint statement released in January that it would steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure. Moreover, in the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan, approved on August 8, 2013, it stated its targets of halving the primary deficit-to-GDP ratio by fiscal 2015 and of achieving a surplus in the primary balance by fiscal 2020. Based on these targets, it is expected that the government will continue making efforts toward fiscal consolidation. 2. Transmission channels of QQE The transmission channels of QQE are as follows. First, the purchases of financial assets will encourage declines in long-term interest rates and risk premiums on assets. This helps to increase firms’ and households’ investment and consumption by lowering their funding costs and through wealth effects. Second, both financial institutions and institutional investors are expected to change their investment behavior and rebalance their portfolios to loans and/or risk assets, such as stocks, in the pursuit of higher returns. This is referred to as the portfolio rebalancing effect. This effect may strengthen the growth potential of Japan’s economy if risk money is increasingly allocated to a wider range of emerging firms, for example. And third, the clear commitment to achieving the price stability target at the earliest possible time and the continuation of massive purchases of assets are expected to drastically change the expectations of markets and economic entities. With these channels acting together, QQE will contribute to pushing up prices by raising inflation expectations and, by stimulating private demand, improving the aggregate supply and demand balance. 3. Financial market developments since the introduction of QQE Looking at developments in economic activity and financial markets since the introduction of QQE, the monetary base has been increasing at an annual pace of about 60–70 trillion yen  – in line with the Bank’s guideline for money market operations – owing to progress in the 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Bank’s large-scale JGB purchases as it proceeds with QQE. Despite some instability observed in the JGB market at the onset, the intended effects of QQE seem to have begun to materialize on the whole, with favorable developments spreading to economic activity and financial markets. Meanwhile, financial conditions remain accommodative. In terms of firms’ funding costs, the average contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts have been low, reaching a historical low, and the year-on-year rate of increase in the amount outstanding of bank lending has increased somewhat to a range of around 2 percent. Issuing conditions for CP and corporate bonds have continued to be favorable on the whole, and there have been several major corporate bond issues. The year-on-year rate of growth in the money stock (M2) has increased to its highest level since 1999, reaching almost 4 percent. Looking at financial markets, money market rates for all maturities have been stable, hovering at a level slightly below 0.1 percent. Long-term interest rates exhibited increased volatility and temporarily reached 1 percent, but have regained stability as the Bank conducted JGB purchases in a flexible manner while maintaining a close dialogue with market participants. Japan’s long-term interest rates have generally been flat in spite of a rise in overseas long-term interest rates reflecting speculation about the direction of U.S. monetary policy, and have recently been contained at a level of 0.7–0.8 percent, below the historical average. Meanwhile, it can be said that inflation expectations have been on a rising trend on the whole, as evidenced (1) by the rise in the diffusion index for output prices in the June 2013 Tankan as well as the rise in the inflation expectations of firms, households, and economists, and (2) by the upturn in market-related indicators following a halt in their decline. Under these circumstances, real interest rates – calculated as nominal interest rates minus the expected inflation rate – have been on a declining trend. If inflation expectations were to rise, this would exert upward pressure on long-term interest rates. The key to strengthening monetary easing effects therefore lies in maintaining real interest rates at a relatively low level, by exerting downward pressure on nominal interest rates through a compression of risk premiums (including term premiums). As for the outlook, downward pressure on interest rates is likely to become increasingly pronounced as the Bank proceeds with its large-scale JGB purchases. In this situation, portfolio rebalancing – in which investors and financial institutions that used to invest their funds in JGBs shift their investment to lending and other assets – is likely to spread steadily. Reflecting the wealth effects brought about by the rise in stock prices since the beginning of the year and the improvement in corporate profits due to the correction of the yen’s appreciation, business and household sentiment has recently improved and fundraising by the private sector has increased moderately. Looking ahead, with the effects of QQE on economic activity becoming increasingly pronounced, a virtuous cycle – in which positive developments in economic activity and changes in expectations bring about further improvement in economic activity and further increases in inflation expectations – would enable the Bank to achieve the 2 percent price stability target. B. Loan support program In order to maintain this virtuous cycle, it is important that firms and households actually make use of the accommodative financial conditions for funding and increase investment and spending, which in turn will lead to an improvement in the aggregate supply and demand balance. However, although some positive developments can now be observed in the demand for credit, many firms still do not borrow to finance their business fixed investment and instead invest only as much as their cash flow will allow. To promote full use of the accommodative financial conditions by firms and households, the Bank – in addition to implementing aggressive monetary easing measures – has established the Loan Support Program. The program consists of two measures: the fund-provisioning measure to stimulate bank lending (hereafter the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility) and the fund-provisioning 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  measure to support strengthening the foundations for economic growth (hereafter the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility). 1. The stimulating bank lending facility The Stimulating Bank Lending Facility was introduced with the aim of prompting financial institutions to take a more active lending stance and stimulating greater proactive credit demand of firms and households. With this facility, the Bank provides long-term yen-denominated funds at a low interest rate to financial institutions that have increased their lending, at their request, up to an amount equivalent to the net increase in their lending for a period of five quarters – the January-March 2013 quarter until the end of the January-March 2014 quarter – from the base period of the October-December 2012 quarter. There shall be no upper limit to the total amount of funds provided by the Bank under this facility. The lending, based on which the net increase is calculated, can be either yen-denominated or foreign currency-denominated. Japanese firms’ international operations as well as financial institutions’ activities to provide funds for such operations play an important role in capturing global demand, so that the Bank’s measure to support lending to firms located overseas or lending by domestic financial institutions’ overseas offices – including foreign currency-denominated lending – contributes to strengthening Japan’s growth potential. In the first loan disbursement under this facility in June 2013, loans amounted to as much as 3.1 trillion yen, underlining the strong demand for such funds. 2. The growth-supporting funding facility The Growth-Supporting Funding Facility was introduced with the aim of supporting the flow of funds to areas with growth potential. The Bank introduced this facility because, in order to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth with price stability, the Bank deemed it important to (1) reverse the downward trend in Japan’s growth rate in the face of the unparalleled decline in the birthrate and aging of the population, (2) increase medium- to long-term growth expectations for Japan’s economy, and (3) put Japan’s economy on a higher medium- to long-term growth path. With this facility, the Bank provides long-term funds – both yen-denominated and foreign currency-denominated – at a low interest rate to financial institutions for their lending and investment to areas that are expected to contribute to strengthening Japan’s growth potential, such as medical and nursing care; environment and energy; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; and tourism. The total amount of lending under these arrangements was set to about 5.5 trillion yen, and the current amount outstanding is nearly 4 trillion yen. The amount of lending and investment actually provided by private financial institutions using this facility greatly exceeds the amount of loans disbursed by the Bank, demonstrating its usefulness as a catalyst. These measures are expected to continue promoting lending activity by financial institutions and to lead to an increase in firms’ proactive demand for credit, such as that for business fixed investment. In order to sustain this cycle for strengthening the economy’s growth potential, it is necessary to help private economic entities to realize their potential to the fullest. In addition to support from the financial side, it is therefore important to build an economic environment where innovations in a broad sense – including the development of new business models – can be achieved more easily. Recently, firms have been making active efforts in a wide range of areas to capitalize on social changes, including business focusing on the elderly, the environment and energy, and information and telecommunications. Such developments need to be supported on the policy side as well. Moreover, securing the labor force by increasing flexibility in the labor market is another significant issue. The labor force participation rate of women currently forms an M-shaped curve, declining to about 70 percent for women aged 25 to 45. If this rate were to rise gradually as a result of greater support for working mothers to both pursue a career and raise children, the decrease in the labor force overall would be moderated. Moreover, if an increasing number of those aged 60 and above were to participate in the labor force, it would be possible to maintain the labor force at the current 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  level for the time being, even in the face of the decline in the birthrate and the aging of the population. In the joint statement with the Bank released in January 2013, the government made clear its intention to formulate measures for strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan’s economy and promote them strongly, in order to revitalize the economy. In the government’s Japan Revitalization Strategy formulated in June, three action plans – (1) the Plan for the Revitalization of Japanese Industry, (2) the Strategic Market Creation Plan, and (3) the Strategy of Global Outreach – have been laid out as concrete measures to be given top priority among other steps forming the growth strategy. If these measures are steadfastly implemented and firms’ growth expectations rise further as a result, and given declining real interest rates, this would further enhance the stimulative effects of monetary easing. The Bank, on its part, will also continue to make its utmost contributions. C. Efforts on the financial side in response to the Great East Japan Earthquake I would now like to talk about the Bank’s efforts on the financial side following the Great East Japan Earthquake. Since immediately after the earthquake, financial institutions in the disaster areas have made strenuous efforts to maintain the functioning of financial and settlement systems by restoring their offices and establishing temporary ones. They have also responded to the needs of people and firms in the disaster areas in various respects, such as permitting the withdrawal of deposits in cases where depositors had lost their passbook, allowing for the exchange of damaged banknotes and coins, and providing support for the funding of disaster-stricken firms. More recently, these institutions have been providing strong support for the restoration of local economies, mainly in business matching and support for corporate turnarounds. From immediately after the earthquake, the Bank swiftly took a range of measures, such as the provision of ample liquidity and the further enhancement of monetary easing, focusing on three major aspects: maintaining the functioning of financial and settlement systems, ensuring the stability of financial markets, and supporting the economy. In this situation, in April 2011 the Bank decided to introduce a funds-supplying operation that provides financial institutions in the disaster areas with longer-term funds at low interest rates in order to lend support to their initial efforts to meet demand for funds for restoration and rebuilding. It also decided to broaden the range of eligible collateral for money market operations. As for the former operation, the deadline for new applications for loans was initially set at end-October 2011, six months after the introduction, but was successively extended thereafter up to the current deadline of end-April 2014. Looking at the usage of loans under this funds-supplying operation to support financial institutions in the disaster areas, the amount outstanding of loans a year after the earthquake reached about 500 billion yen vis-à-vis the 1 trillion yen ceiling, and most recently has been about 400 billion yen. The reason that financial institutions in the disaster areas have made little use of loans under this operation relative to the ceiling is that their funding conditions have generally been favorable as they have been receiving funds for reconstruction from various sources. Nevertheless, the operation can be regarded as effective in that it has provided a safety valve for any unanticipated demand for funds, providing leeway for these institutions in their efforts to meet demand for funds for restoration and rebuilding. As the disaster areas are expected to see an increase in the demand for funds as reconstruction progresses, the Bank will continue to provide firm support to financial institutions engaged in reconstruction efforts so as to allow for active lending. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Joachim Nagel: How market segments changed over the crisis – challenges for future banking Speech by Dr Joachim Nagel, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the ESE (the European Supervisor Education initiative) Conference 2013 “The future of European financial supervision”, Frankfurt am Main, 26 September 2013. *      *      * 1. Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen I am delighted to be speaking at this year’s European Supervisor Education (ESE) Conference. The idea of the ESE initiative is to bring together the experiences of practitioners and the theoretical knowledge of academic researchers. The Bundesbank has always considered this to be an important issue and has, as a founder member, supported this initiative from the beginning. As most of you are experts in banking supervision, I will not try to tell you anything new about the recent regulatory changes. Instead, my focus will lie on the changing market conditions  – partly triggered by new regulations – and their impact on banking, especially bank funding. The challenges currently facing the European banking sector are reflected in the remarkable changes in the refinancing pattern of European banks on the capital and interbank money markets. As a central banker, I have a special interest in developments in the money markets, so this will be my first main topic. Subsequently, I will discuss some regulatory aspects such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and its possible impact on capital markets. Thereafter, I would like to describe some changes in the repo market and the ongoing trend towards clearing via central counterparties, followed by a discussion of developments in the market for covered assets. Before I summarise, I will cover the sovereign bond market. 2. Money market conditions before and since the financial crisis Up until 2007, the euro interbank money markets were characterised by small counterparty risk premia and highly liquid markets. Risk aversion was low, and there was significant trust in, and among, banks. As a consequence of the financial crisis and the sudden loss of confidence between counterparties, overall turnovers in the euro money market declined significantly, especially in the unsecured segment. Even today, unsecured trading in maturities longer than three months is very rare. At the same time, the importance of secured market activity has increased, reflecting heightened concerns about counterparty risk. At the current juncture, turnover in the secured segment is more than three times higher than in the unsecured segment. Secured trading can limit credit risk, as the lender will suffer a loss only if the counterparty and the pledged collateral default simultaneously. As limiting credit risk has become a fundamental concern during the crisis, importance is increasingly being attached to the liquidity of collateral markets and the associated collateral pricing.  The growing share of secured trading via electronic trading platforms can be explained mainly by the increased turnover in the secured segment. These platforms offer clearing services through central counterparties (CCPs). CCPs limit counterparty credit risk and mitigate information asymmetry within the market. As the CCP guarantees the transaction and defines quality standards for both, participants and the accepted collateral, information about the individual counterparties becomes less important. By acting as an intermediary between the trading partners, the CCP enables them to trade anonymously on these platforms. This helped stressed market participants from peripheral countries to access the collateralised money market throughout the crisis. In spite of these positive effects, the increasing importance of CCPs harbours the risk of contagion effects. The default of one of 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches these central and highly connected interbank participants might have serious impacts on markets. The uncertainty involved with transactions between banks of different countries has another consequence. The Eurosystem has become the most important counterparty in the euro money market. Before the first tensions were felt, the Eurosystem generally ensured broadly balanced liquidity conditions. Credit institutions on aggregate were allotted as much liquidity as was needed under given autonomous factors. With the full allotment policy, liquidity provision increased sharply. As a consequence of very low market rates relative to the deposit facility and amid concerns over the credit quality of counterparties, a clear preference emerged for storing liquidity on central bank accounts rather than lending it in the interbank market. In short, liquidity flows between banks were much smaller than before the crisis. The Eurosystem’s central intermediary role became even more evident when it started to supply long-term liquidity via one-year and three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs). The three-year LTROs were introduced to support bank lending. Furthermore, they eased tensions in the sovereign bond markets of the peripheral countries, as banks intensified their government bond purchases. However, we have observed a strong preference on the part of banks to buy bonds issued by their home countries. This amplified the interdependence of the banking sector and the domestic sovereign bond market in certain euro-area countries and aggravated the existing geographical segmentation. The geographical segmentation is reflected in European banks’ reliance on Eurosystem refinancing. After the Lehman insolvency, this reliance initially increased in most countries as risk aversion rose. Later, segmentation developed differently across countries, reflecting the perceived riskiness of each country. More recently, the Eurosystem policy to mitigate market segmentation and to safeguard an appropriate monetary policy transmission, namely by announcing Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs), is mirrored in reduced country differences. But this is no justification for the OMTs. It has eased market tensions, especially redomination risk. Nonetheless, the Bundesbank’s concerns are still extremely relevant. Country differences regarding the reliance on Eurosystem refinancing remain large, as indicated by the share of banks’ balance sheets that is financed by Eurosystem liquidity. This has also become obvious in the structure of early repayments of the three-year LTROs. It has mainly been banks located in the core countries that have reduced outstanding volumes. Furthermore, the reliance on national counterparties has increased. Over the last few years, euro-area cross-border activity has declined constantly. 3. Regulatory changes as reaction to the crisis and their impact on market structure and banking The experience of the recent financial crisis has triggered regulatory changes, especially in the banking sector. The new Basel III banking standards will address some of the root causes of the financial crisis and aim to prevent another build-up of liquidity and solvency risks. The Basel III framework for liquidity risk regulation encompasses two ratios – the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). Both will have an impact on how banks manage their business activities. As the LCR will be introduced earlier and the details are far more developed, I will discuss its impact on euro money markets. However, the LCR might yet be revised before its final implementation. With regard to the assets side of a bank’s balance sheet, a bank will primarily purchase High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) to improve LCR compliance. Holding these assets outright will improve the LCR. Demand for these assets is likely to increase, potentially causing them to trade at a premium. This regulatory-driven additional demand might reduce appetite for lower-quality liquid assets. Turning to the liabilities side, banks with an LCR of below one will need to substitute short-term for longer-term funding. This could reduce the volume in the short-term unsecured 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 interbank market, though banks will probably continue to engage in significant short-term unsecured trading for daily liquidity management purposes, as they will still need to fulfil reserve requirements. Central banks will have to monitor the impact the new liquidity regulations have on monetary policy implementation. Unlike interbank funding, central bank refinancing over a 30-day horizon would not count as an outflow in the LCR, as it always benefits from a 100% rollover rate. This could increase demand for central bank refinancing. If non-HQLA are used as collateral, there would be no reduction in the numerator and, therefore, the LCR would rise. Banks may therefore choose to boost their cash reserves at the central bank (which count as HQLA) by increasing their central bank refinancing that is backed with non-HQLA as collateral. While this also depends on the opportunity cost of obtaining liquidity from the Eurosystem, there may be a number of banks with large amounts of collateral that is not classified as liquid under Basel III but that is eligible for monetary policy operations. However, the interaction of LCR with monetary policy operations and the money markets has been acknowledged. In January 2013, changes to the LCR were announced. In particular, the timetable for fully phasing in the LCR requirement has been extended from 2015 to 2019. Additionally, the list of HQLA has been broadened and punctual recalibration of the net cash outflows will give banks more time to recover from the crisis and to implement the LCR in a more orderly manner. This will likely reduce the level of market fragmentation that might otherwise have arisen had all banks had to meet the LCR 100% requirement by 2015. In general, Basel III is the right answer to the lessons learned from the crisis. Nonetheless, its impact on market patterns and banking behaviour has to be monitored carefully to prevent undesirable developments. 4. Repo market The net impact on a bank’s liquidity position of increasing its level of repo funding is somewhat more complex, but overall it tends to improve the LCR and encourages a greater level of secured funding, irrespective of duration. However, the higher demand for good and liquid assets may reduce the supply for repo markets – potentially reducing liquidity in the secured repo markets and adding to market volatility, particularly in times of stress. Secured transactions, especially transactions via CCPs, have reanimated the money market in times of high uncertainty. This is also reflected in the fact that the share of international counterparties on trading platforms such as GC Pooling increased during the crisis. One reason is that it became apparent during the financial crisis that big and well-established counterparties, too, can become illiquid or insolvent. Under these circumstances, collateralisation has become more important. However, there is a growing gap: the importance of collateral quality has risen sharply, and at the same time, high quality and liquid collateral is becoming a limiting factor. Furthermore, the ability to increase debt funding through repo transactions will also be limited by regulatory changes in the future. Additionally, the ample liquidity provided by the Eurosystem, especially via the two three-year LTROs, together with the enlarged collateral framework for Eurosystem refinancing has led to reduced activity in this market segment, too. The decisive question for market participants now is whether the Eurosystem will stick to or reduce its non-standard monetary policy measures such as the full allotment policy and the enlarged collateral framework. Given declining excess liquidity related, in particular, to the early repayments of the three-year LTROs, new business models may arise in the medium term as banks’ funding needs will pick up again. It is therefore up to market participants to find a new balance between risks and benefits in relation to cross-border lending. Furthermore, the importance of banks’ collateral management will be further enhanced as a consequence of the crisis. Credit institutions should aim to manage their collateral more 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches efficiently without taking on additional risks. CCPs and the use of trading platforms can contribute to this. Another important factor on the repo market of the future will be the planned financial transaction tax (FTT). In its current design, it may harm the short-term repo market segment, as even a low tax rate of 0.1% for trading a sovereign bond represents a high burden to short-term and revolving repo transactions. To illustrate the problem, I would like to give you an example: for an over-night repo transaction with a current interest rate of 0.04% and a volume of EUR 10 million, a total of EUR 10,011 (ie EUR 11 in interest and EUR 10.000 in FTT) has to be paid. The tax-free use of the marginal lending facility of the Eurosystem involves a payment of EUR 278 in interest. Funding via the repo market would be 36-times more expensive than central bank refinancing. Such a financial transaction tax would probably reduce repo market activity and encourage Eurosystem refinancing. That is not desirable. 5. Market for covered assets Turning to longer-term funding instruments, I would first like to mention that EU banks’ total issuance of debt funding dropped by 12% year on year in the first half of 2013 to its lowest level since 2002. Besides the ample liquidity provided by the Eurosystem, which reduces banks’ demand for additional funding, the regulatory changes resulted in banks seeking to reduce their reliance on wholesale funding in favour of deposits from retail and small business customers. The decrease in borrowing also reflects pressures facing banks, such as the need for smaller, more robust balance sheets, and concerns among investors about “bail-in” rules. Consequently, banks may face higher funding costs as investors demand more compensation for the increased risk of losing their money. In addition, higher asset encumbrance has an impact on unsecured bank creditors. The more bank assets are used for secured funding, the less remain to secure investors in unsecured instruments in the case of insolvency. They will price in a risk premium for this form of bank funding. As in the money market, we observe fragmentation between core and peripheral countries in Europe. The perceived risk of financial sectors in the periphery and in the core euro area started to diverge back in 2010 when the financial crisis turned into a sovereign debt crisis. Still, the individual quality of banks’ balance sheets influences investment decisions significantly. Banks located in peripheral countries have reduced their issuance to a higher degree. Developments in their home economies have stressed their balance sheets, namely by the share of non-performing-loans. Furthermore, the nexus of sovereign and financial sector credit risks has made funding a lot more expensive, if not impossible, for them. Therefore many of these banks are still highly dependent on Eurosystem funding. The lower demand has also made itself felt in the volumes of secured instruments issued, although markets have, since the crisis, displayed a preference for secured funding. Covered bond issuance volumes declined given an ample liquidity supply by the Eurosystem and a tendency towards balance-sheet deleveraging. In the first seven months of 2013, the volume of newly issued covered bonds denominated in euro decreased by 38%. Issuance volume has therefore reached its lowest level since 2009. Given that the volume of matured Covered bonds significantly exceeds issues, the resulting excess demand has narrowed covered bond spreads against Bunds. The US tapering discussion, which started at the end of May, led to a widening of spreads, especially of peripheral issuers. The overall improvement in market sentiment regarding the European sovereign debt crisis has enabled banks located in peripheral countries to step up issuance. The share of issues with volumes of between EUR 500 million and EUR 1 billion, so called “mini-Jumbos”, has grown. This development can be attributed to the growing importance of better asset-liability management as a result of regulatory changes that require, amongst others, a better maturity match. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Another secured funding market, the ABS market, is still suffering from the financial crisis, which was partly caused by its own excessive developments. Therefore, the stricter regulatory rules regarding ABS are important to prevent similar developments in the future. However, we should bear in mind that the ABS market is quite heterogeneous. “Plain vanilla” ABS backed by high-quality assets are fairly safe investments which have wrongly got a bad reputation. To increase investor confidence, the Eurosystem has supported the ABS market by promoting the “Loan Level Data Initiative”, which has significantly improved transparency regarding underlying assets. In turn, this has allowed the Eurosystem to relax collateral requirements for ABS recently. ABS are one the most prominent asset classes used as collateral for Eurosystem refinancing operations. However, recently, covered bonds and government bonds have gained importance. Nearly half of ABS issues were placed publicly in the first half of 2013 compared to one-third in the second half of 2012. This shows some improvement in this market. Spreads on the secondary market have also narrowed significantly in the last 12 months. However, the Portuguese government crisis in June demonstrated that political incidents influence ABS spreads directly. Although Portugal is a relatively small country, developments there had a strong impact on the spreads of ABS backed by assets originated by banks from other peripheral countries, especially Spain. In terms of the different types of ABS, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) still represent by far the biggest share of the market. While ABS backed by loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME ABS) represent a sizeable share of the market, many issues are retained and used directly as collateral for Eurosystem refinancing operations. However, the Eurosystem believes that SME ABS could and should represent a sizeable source of bank financing. They could encourage lending to SMEs and foster the transmission of monetary policy by indirectly easing lending conditions to SMEs. In the press conference held on 2 May, ECB President Draghi therefore announced a consultation with other European institutions on “initiatives to promote a functioning market for asset-backed securities collateralised by loans to non-financial corporations”. This statement was further backed by the announcement on 18 July that the ECB will continue to investigate the possible acceptance of certain guaranteed mezzanine tranches of SME ABS. Another structured instrument I would like to mention are contingent convertibles (CoCos), which could complement banks’ various refinancing instruments. As it is a fairly new instrument with a lot of different arrangements, it is difficult to estimate the exact scope of this market segment. CoCos are a useful instrument to increase the capital base in times of stress. They automatically turn into core tier 1 capital if the trigger – mostly the core capital rate – is undershot. Investors have to be compensated for this extra risk alongside default risk and subordination risk in case of insolvency. Recently, this additional spread has shrunk as a consequence of the increased “search for yield” in the low interest rate environment. Consequently, CoCos may become establish as a funding instrument although they bear the risk of being converted or even written down to zero. As I approach the end of my speech, I would like to focus on a market which has changed a lot during the crisis and also plays a prominent role in central bank politics: the sovereign bond market. 6. Sovereign bond market Government bond markets have suffered during the ongoing banking crisis, especially as it turned into a sovereign debt crisis. They are no longer considered a homogeneous, risk-free asset class. Investors’ willingness to take risk diminished sharply. Volatility and liquidity became the most important topics for market participants. Bond buyers exercised greater scrutiny and a series of rating downgrades prompted investors to re-evaluate their belief that European 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches government bonds are risk-free assets. This led to a differentiated perception of European government bonds and diverging yields for the individual countries. To a certain degree, the increased spreads seem to be justified. They reflect diverging fundamentals in different countries – ie the different economic situation and levels of public debt. It is questionable whether the convergence of yields in the years before the crisis reflected the right assessment of the various risks underlying these investments. Currently, refinancing conditions for the peripheral countries have improved notably. Hence, OMT will hopefully never have to be activated. However, market sentiment can change very quickly. In January 2010, Greece received offers of about EUR 25 billion for its five-year government bond issue with a volume of EUR 8 billion. A couple of weeks later, Greece was no longer able to refinance its liabilities via the capital market. Although there are currently small improvements in GDP growth in several European countries, the risk of renewed tensions in sovereign debt markets is still alive given low growth and the slow implementation of reforms on the one hand and the expected tapering of the Fed’s quantitative easing programme on the other hand. Lower investor confidence, besides sending European government bond yields and CDS premia higher in the secondary markets, has also impacted the primary markets. The space left by external creditors was occupied by domestic investors such as banks, who increased their investments particularly following the introduction of the three-year LTROs. The trend towards renationalisation is a development that needs to be monitored. It reinforces the interdependence of the sovereign sector and the domestic banking system. European banks often only invest in the sovereign bonds of their home countries. Credit institutions must increase their risk awareness in terms of sovereign bonds. On the one hand, banks should have credit limits for individual countries. This would reduce dependencies on certain debtors. On the other hand, these bonds have to be secured by a sufficient level of equity. In the medium term, government bonds should be treated like corporate bonds. Experience has taught us that sovereign bonds are not a risk-free asset. Furthermore, risk-appropriate treatment would lead to increasing yields of countries with unsound finances. Therefore, market regulation would provide an incentive for fiscal discipline. The current initiative to establish an effective Single Supervisory Mechanism is a step in the right direction. It will help us to identify risks at an earlier stage and is therefore also important for disentangling the critical link between sovereign and bank funding. However, the banking union, consisting of a sound Single Supervisory Mechanism and Single Resolution Mechanism, is a future project to prevent future problems. Existing burdens have to be treated separately. They arose under national responsibility and should not be mutualised. Therefore, the planned financial inventory of banks’ balance sheets is crucial and needs a close examination. Banks which do not have a sustainable business model should not be kept alive with public financial support. 7. Closing remarks Overall, stress levels in the markets for European government bonds and bank refinancing have diminished significantly since the summer of 2012. Nevertheless, the question whether the interbank market will return to its former integrated status remains open. Secured trading in connection with the use of CCPs may play a crucial role in the changing environment as it reduces counterparty risk and helps to improve collateral management. The ongoing repayments of the three-year LTROs reduces excess liquidity in the money market and could be interpreted as suggesting that market participants no longer need as much access to central bank liquidity as before. But let me be unequivocal about one thing: this development has been induced by the markets, it has not been triggered by the Eurosystem. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Furthermore, banks should focus on achieving a reasonable mix of short-term funding and refinancing via longer-term repos and bond issues. This could help alleviate the current tendency of some banks to leave their cash reserves in the ECB’s deposit facility rather than offering them in the interbank market. This would be an important step towards re-establishing a well-integrated money market in the euro area. The regulatory steps undertaken with Basel III go in the right direction, but their impact on the markets has to be carefully considered. In the banking sector, business models need further adjustments, which should ultimately result in a more resilient and diversified sector with a more sustainable risk-return profile. In the current low interest rate environment, it is surely no easy task to increase earnings. However, developments so far go in the right direction as eg German banks’ average equity base has improved considerably since the beginning of the crisis. For the twenty biggest credit institutions, the core capital rate has doubled on average. Nonetheless, the interconnectedness between banks and their home country has to be monitored closely as it holds a strong contagion risk. Thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stefan Ingves: The evolution of the Basel Committee Welcome and keynote address by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at a symposium to mark 25 years of the Basel Capital Accord “25 years of international financial regulation: Challenges and opportunities”, Basel, 26 September 2013. *      *      * Good morning everyone. On behalf of the Basel Committee, I would like to welcome you to today’s symposium, which the Committee is hosting to mark 25 years since the first Basel Accord on bank capital was established. And let me at the same time also acknowledge Jaime Caruana and the BIS, not only for hosting this event, but also for their unwavering support of the Committee over the past almost 40 years. As many of you know, the Basel Committee started out in 1974 as the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices. In the aftermath of the Herstatt collapse, the G10 Governors of the day were seeking ways to preserve and promote the stability of the international financial system. It is worth reflecting during the morning, as we discuss the Committee’s achievements to date, that the basic problems we encounter today – poorly run institutions, interconnectedness and financial instability – are the same as those faced by the Committee when it was founded. This is not to imply that nothing has been achieved: on the contrary, a great deal has been done and the world has benefited greatly. But, despite our efforts, banks regularly lose money in the same old way: while pursuing profits, growth and market share without adequate heed to risk. Unfortunately, they often find clever new ways of doing this, so that it isn’t always easy to see how the same old habits will be repeated. While today’s Committee members are, I’m sure, looking for some respite from the ambitious work programme of post-crisis reforms, we also need to recognise that nobody can guarantee a crisis-free future. Therefore, we must remain vigilant against old risks re-emerging in new shapes and forms. I will speak shortly about some of the key influences that have shaped the evolution of the Basel Committee over the years. Before I start, however, I would like to warmly welcome a number of special guests today: • First let me welcome Peter Cooke. Having headed the Committee for more than a decade, Peter has been our longest-serving Chair – and, probably more than any other person, he was instrumental in laying the foundations for the Committee’s subsequent achievements. Indeed, his contribution is best highlighted by the fact that, for many years, people did not refer to the Basel Committee, but to the “Cooke Committee” and the “Cooke ratio” – although I know Peter is the first to acknowledge that the credit for the Accord is shared by many. Peter – we are very pleased that you and your wife Julia can be with us today. • Let me also acknowledge a number of Peter’s colleagues on the Committee through the critical period of 1986–88 when the Accord was settled. I am delighted that you were all able to join us today. • Finally, I would especially like to welcome Paul Volcker to the symposium. Paul was instrumental within the G10 Governors in pushing for an international benchmark on bank capital. In particular, together with Robin Leigh-Pemberton of the Bank of England, he was critical in forging the agreement that produced the world’s first international standard for bank capital. Paul – I don’t think it is too much to say that a great deal of today’s global financial regulation was founded on your original vision. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  As a scene-setter for this morning’s discussions, I would offer some thoughts on the key influences on the evolution of the Committee to date. The Basel Committee and its activities have changed almost beyond recognition since its establishment in 1974, or even since 1988 when the first Accord was agreed. I doubt whether the founding Governors really foresaw what the Committee would eventually become: not just an international standard setter, but also one that now conducts peer reviews of members’ compliance with their agreements. Indeed, if they had, I suspect that a few of them might have been against the Committee’s establishment in the first place! But times change, the financial sector has evolved, and the Committee has moved with the times. Among the many factors that have influenced the work of the Committee over the years, I thought I would identify five that have shaped what the Committee is today and will continue to guide its activities in the future. The first and most obvious is the evolution from a coordinating and information-sharing group to one that has become a standard setter. Although the 1975 Concordat was the Committee’s first substantive agreement, and its first public document, it was not a standard per se: rather, it was a sensible agreement on how supervisory responsibilities could be divided for banks operating across national boundaries. Its goal was modest: to make sure no bank could escape supervision. It did not try to harmonise supervisory standards. And, of course, it was primarily directed at supervisors, not banks themselves. In subsequent years, the Committee pronounced on international lending and foreign exchange positions. These documents began to set expectations for the way in which banks should manage these risks, but they were not standards in the way we use the word today. It was the first Basel Accord that really marked this new role for the Committee. As in 1974, a severe crisis triggered this step – in that case, the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s, which raised the political pressure for banks to increase their capital base and for the regulators to create an international level playing field in this respect. Since then, the Committee’s role as a standard setter has only grown – to the extent that, today, this is seen as its primary purpose. Whereas the Committee took 10 years to publish its first 10 documents, this year alone it has published more than 30 – with more to come. But with all the public focus on standard-setting, it is important not to forget the critical “behind the scenes” role of information-sharing, since we all well know that regulation cannot be successful without strong supervision and cooperation to back it up. The second important influence on the Committee has been the growing sophistication and complexity of international financial markets. The original Basel Accord was beautiful in its simplicity – something that many people long for today – but it could not keep up with the development of increasingly complex financial instruments. These may have offered substantial benefits to society, but they strained the simple Basel I methodology. The Committee’s response was most obviously manifested in Basel II. This marked another turning-point in the Committee’s evolution, moving us from a “one size fits all” regime to differential approaches using internal models. This meant the regulatory regime was better aligned with banks’ underlying risk profile, but regulation was now no longer simple or completely uniform across banks. Like any change, it has delivered some undoubted benefits, but it has also created a whole new range of challenges that we are still grappling with today. The third key influence on the Committee stems from increasing globalisation. As a creature of the G10, the Committee could originally lay claim to coverage of most of the world’s truly internationally active banks. But as banks and financial markets became increasingly integrated across national borders, this claim to be the standard setter for all internationally active banks became more and more difficult to justify. During the 1990s and 2000s, the Committee made good use of its Core Principles Liaison Group to seek advice from members outside the G10. The CPLG’s contribution was highly 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  constructive when Basel II was developed, for example. But as the size and importance of jurisdictions “outside the tent” grew, even this arrangement became increasingly untenable. And so, in 2009, the Committee essentially stepped up from a G10 to a G20 foundation as it sought a truly coordinated response to the global financial crisis. Indeed, we now have more than 40 organisations representing 27 member jurisdictions around the table. As a result, the Committee’s coverage of global banking assets has gone from about 60% to 90%. This much greater inclusiveness lends, in turn, greater legitimacy and credibility to the Committee’s standards, as they are now set by a process that is truly reflective of international markets. The fourth key influence is a more recent one – the shift in thinking from a micro- to a macroprudential perspective. For much of its life, the Committee focused primarily on microprudential issues. That is not to say the macroprudential angle was ignored, but there was certainly a view – quite prevalent in the pre-crisis world – that if banks were individually stable, the financial system would itself stay upright. During the Great Moderation, little appetite existed for new tools and international regulations of a macroprudential nature, even if the Committee could have foreseen all of the looming threats. The financial crisis brought home the lesson that financial stability could not be assured only through the use of microprudential tools. And so Basel III represents another important step in the Committee’s development. Basel III has substantially enhanced the microprudential framework. And, in the countercyclical buffer, it has also introduced the first international agreement on a macroprudential tool. Subsequent work on the framework for systemically important banks (both global and domestic) has further expanded the Committee’s input into this relatively new field – a trend that is unlikely to be reversed. My fifth key influence on the Committee’s evolution is also quite recent, and hence its eventual impact on the Committee’s work is still difficult to foresee: its role in monitoring the implementation of Committee standards. Post-crisis, the Committee has not only expanded its membership, but it has also taken on the role of monitoring the implementation of the standards agreed by its members. To an outsider, that may not sound significant – indeed, some might reasonably ask why the Committee wasn’t already doing this – but it is notable if only as an idea that the Committee had previously considered and rejected on more than one occasion. Indeed, in his authoritative history of the Committee’s early years, Charles Goodhart notes that, as far back as 1983, there was discussion whether the Committee might also monitor the practical application of agreements. At the time, though, this was seen as somewhat awkward and a step too far. That the Committee now has just such a mandate shows that the commitment to consistent international regulation is undiminished – indeed, it is stronger than it has ever been. Let me conclude by once again welcoming you to Basel, particularly those of you who have played a role in the Committee’s earlier years – we hope that returning here brings back many good memories. For the current Committee members, it is a wonderful opportunity to learn from the wisdom of those who have grappled with these issues before us. We also hope to hear some different perspectives, from the banking industry, and from academia, on the challenges and opportunities that face the Committee. I am therefore looking forward to some productive – and hopefully provocative – discussions this morning. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Carlos da Silva Costa: Portugal’s situation in the post-Troika period Address by Mr Carlos da Silva Costa, Governor of the Bank of Portugal, at the “Portugal post-Troika” economists meeting, Lisbon, 5 July 2013. *      *      * Thank you, Mr. President. In my speech, I would like to address Portugal’s situation in the post-Troika period, starting with an assessment of how we got there, i.e. “the day before”. Indeed, the situation on the day before the conclusion of the Economic and Financial Assistance Programme is as important as the day after, given that it conditions subsequent developments. I. The day before the conclusion of the Adjustment Programme Taking into account the currently available economic projections, and using traffic lights as reference, we reach the time of transition with our external account indicators exhibiting a “green” light, economic activity indicators and a number of fiscal indicators a “yellow” one and unemployment and public debt a “red” one (Table 1). Table 1 Macroeconomic outlook at the conclusion of the Economic and Financial Assistance Programme  Note: June 2013 projections Sources: IMF and Banco de Portugal. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Significant adjustment in external accounts (green) The external rebalancing of the Portuguese economy is remarkable, having been quicker and stronger than in the two previous programmes, when the foreign exchange rate was used as an adjustment instrument. The current and capital account and the goods and services account – which in 2012 recorded positive figures for the first time in decades – should remain in surplus. This adjustment reflects both the impact of contracting domestic demand on imports and the increase in the market share of Portuguese exports. In fact, in a particularly adverse international environment, Portuguese firms made remarkable efforts to enhance the penetration and diversification of export markets. Muted recovery in economic activity and continuation of the process of fiscal deficit reduction (yellow) However, the dynamics of exports was not sufficient to sustain economic activity expansion. In fact, economic activity contracted more than initially projected and the current outlook points to a muted recovery in 2014. Fiscal adjustment, albeit lower than initially projected, is very substantial. The primary fiscal balance, which excludes interest expenditure, improved substantially. The adjustment is also very significant if we look to developments in the structural balance of public finances. However, the fiscal consolidation process was slower than expected and its sustainability must be ensured through public expenditure-cutting measures. Unemployment and public debt are very high and still growing (red) The level of unemployment is clearly a cause for concern, namely given that it largely reflects structural unemployment. This situation calls for the implementation of a safety network that safeguards social cohesion, allows for the re-training of long-term unemployed and prevents them from falling into inactivity. Public debt reached very high levels and is still growing. It is imperative that its developments ensure a sustainable path. This constitutes the main constraint on economic policy in the future. I would here like to draw attention to one point which is of fundamental importance to me and deserves thorough consideration. As pointed out in Mr. Marco Buti’s speech, our adjustment programme was strictly implemented. This notwithstanding, a perception of failure arose among the Portuguese population and social and political players, namely the perception that we have failed to meet the programme targets. This perception is incorrect. Therefore, in my opinion, it is not only necessary, but important to debunk this idea, stressing that:  first, international economic developments were much more adverse than previously expected, which had very negative consequences for exports, investment, economic activity and, consequently, fiscal revenues and expenditure and public debt. As such, and by way of illustration, if external demand had evolved in line with what had been initially projected in the Programme, the effort of budgetary adjustment made to date would imply that the government debt ratio would already be on a downward path (the dashed line in Figure 1 below).  second, the Programme’s projections relied on fiscal multipliers that were ultimately below those estimated ex post. Increased uncertainty among economic agents that resulted from the continued weakness of the external environment of the Portuguese economy and, in particular, the simultaneous fiscal consolidation process under way in those external economies, led economic agents to predict a higher fall in permanent income. As a consequence, the impact of fiscal consolidation measures on GDP – the multipliers – was underestimated.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Figure 1 Public debt as a percentage of GDP  Source: Banco de Portugal. The combination of these two adverse factors with the establishment of the Programme’s targets as a percentage of GDP has made it necessary to revise those targets, on pain of triggering and feeding a vicious circle between fiscal consolidation and economic activity developments. This warrants some rethinking of the adjustment programmes’ target set-up so as to prevent the return effect of GDP developments on compliance with the budgetary targets – through tax revenues and social spending – and debt targets – through tax revenues, social spending and the “denominator effect”. My message, to Mr. Buti in particular, is: the fiscal targets of future programmes should not be set as a percentage of GDP, but in the form of limits to nominal public expenditure given that these targets can be controlled by fiscal policymakers and, as such, allow for an actual assessment of the results achieved and the consequent accountability for failures. Still on the subject of the day before the post-Troika period, it is important to take into account the degree of financial market access by the sovereign issuer. If market access is not restored in a credible and sustained manner over time, upon the Programme’s conclusion, a very painful process will begin. For this reason, the issuance of five and ten-year Portuguese Treasury bonds, in January and May respectively, are key milestones. They were crucial so as to gauge the market’s “temperature” and to set up the progressive credibility enhancing of the Portuguese government debt. It should be recalled that, even after we balance public accounts, we will continue to depend on financial markets, given the substantial need to pay off existing public debt (Figures 2 and 3). This means that we will still need financial markets to be willing to refinance our debt. To this end, investors must feel comfortable with the public debt level, its development path and the consistency and credibility of the fiscal process. To sum up, creditors must feel that: our debt is sustainable, our fiscal policy accommodates the respective servicing, its reduction is consistent in the medium run and political players ensure compliance with the resulting liabilities. Given the state of our public finances, the leverage available to us is restricted to the pace of public debt adjustment. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Figure 2 Public debt – maturity profile  Source: Banco de Portugal. Figure 3 Medium and long-term debt annual repayment schedule (after extension of the EFSF and EFSM loans)  Source: IGCP (Portuguese Treasury and Debt Management Agency). By way of illustration, it should be noted that, assuming a long-term growth rate of nominal GDP at around 3 per cent, compliance with budgetary targets set in the programme for 2013–2014 and the fiscal compact commitments thereafter (in particular, a structural adjustment in the primary balance of at least 0.5 p.p. per year) would make it possible for us to reach a government debt-to-GDP ratio of approximately 60 per cent around 2030 (Figure 4). This means that, in a scenario of return to economic growth, compliance with medium-term commitments under the fiscal compact would imply a sustainability path in the medium to long run for the Portuguese public debt. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Figure 4 Public debt as a percentage of GDP   Note: Assumptions of this scenario: (i) fulfilment of the Programme targets in 2013 and 2014; (ii) increase of the structural primary balance by 0.5% of GDP per year until 2020, reaching the MTO; (iii) consolidation effort exclusively on the expenditure side; (iv) increase in the implicit interest rate on public debt to 4.4% in 2020 (3.9% in 2012). Source: Banco de Portugal. This exercise corresponds to an aggressive adjustment profile in terms of public debt reduction. My preference goes to a smoother debt adjustment path, compatible with a parallel decline in the tax burden. Figure 5 shows a scenario of gradual reduction of the tax burden over time resulting from a freeze on nominal expenditure, against a background of strict compliance with fiscal commitments. This scenario would result in a slower reduction of public debt, albeit on a sustainable path, which would have the advantage of allowing for a tax burden reduction. It is common knowledge that I have advocated that the “bonus” resulting from economic growth should be divided between public debt cuts and tax cuts. Debt reduction is key to enhance our credibility with financial markets and, accordingly, ensure refinancing. In turn, a tax burden reduction is fundamental to unlock the growth potential and absorb structural unemployment in Portugal. It would be useful if we could arrive at a broad political consensus, in tandem with a broad consensus among social partners, whereby we would accept that the future economic growth bonus be used to reduce public debt and taxes. To this end, one option would be to reach a compromise to maintain nominal public expenditure at a constant level from 2015 onwards, which corresponds to a decline in real terms equivalent to the inflation rate at that time.

Source: Banco de Portugal. II. The post-Troika period The challenges that lie ahead after the conclusion of the Economic and Financial Assistance Programme are not smaller than those faced in the course of the Programme. More specifically, we must be able to answer the following questions: How can we ensure that the return to the financial markets is not reversed? How can we ensure sustained and balanced economic growth of the Portuguese economy within the euro area? As mentioned by the President and Mr. Buti, to answer these questions certain conditions must be fulfilled both at domestic and external level (Figure 6). At domestic level, and in the short run, the adjustment process of the Portuguese economy must go forward. This means, inter alia, to proceed with the consolidation of public accounts, improve banking system profitability, push on with the household and corporate balance sheet adjustment, create a social security network for long-term unemployed and to set up conditions inducing potential output growth in Portugal.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Figure 6 Conditions for a successful exit of the Programme  Looking further ahead, a new institutional framework must be established, on the basis of a broad consensus, fostering behaviours consistent with the maintenance of fundamental macroeconomic balances and the economy’s competitive capacity. In this context, the first point to have in mind is social cohesion. The ongoing sectoral shift in the Portuguese economy suggests that unemployment rates should remain high over a protracted period of time. Safeguarding social cohesion is key so we can manage unemployment in line with its structural nature. In fact, a mechanical exercise conducted in Banco de Portugal shows that an 8 per cent annual growth of external demand up to 2020 would have a cumulative reducing impact of 7 p.p. on the unemployment rate (to around 11 per cent), which means that the solution to our unemployment problem does not lie on the demand side. We must be able to free up and generate entrepreneurial skills, attract foreign direct investment and boost our productive sector. At the same time, we must create support schemes to re-train long-term unemployed with a view to increase their employability. In addition to social cohesion, there are two other conditions which I find important. The first is the creation of a political consensus on the Portuguese economic policy leeway. This political consensus is not the same as “unanimity”, it is, rather, the acknowledgment of economic policy limits and the curtailment of the political discussion to those limits resulting from our external financing constraints and public indebtedness. The second condition is consensus among social partners. We must enhance the dialogue between social partners, so as to ensure a realistic negotiation of the distribution of income, i.e. taking into account productivity gains in the economy. We can draw inspiration from the experience in countries like Belgium and Finland. These countries have in place systems that, in case of risks to competitiveness, subordinate wage settlements to the imperative of safeguarding competitiveness and employment. At the same time, external conditions supportive of our adjustment must be put in place. These external conditions depend on the solidarity of our European partners, which can only 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches be accomplished if we prove to have a sense of responsibility and the ability to comply with our commitments. The keyword in this whole process is “trust”. Setting up the above-mentioned domestic conditions is important to strengthen our partners’ confidence in the fulfilment of our obligations over time and to win their solidarity. As regards short-term external conditions for a successful exit of the adjustment programme, I consider it crucial that European mechanisms be in place so as to address incidental factors. To deal with any excess volatility in financial markets and, consequently, prevent investors from moving away from Portuguese debt, European intervention mechanisms in the primary and secondary Portuguese debt markets must be in place, which, in turn, entails the adoption of a precautionary programme. The precautionary programme will help enhance the credibility of the macroeconomic adjustment process in the period immediately after the conclusion of the Programme. The associated conditionality is, on the one hand, the counterpart to our European partners’ solidarity and, on the other hand, a key element to consolidate market confidence in the country’s economic policies. Turning to medium-term conditions, it is crucial that the European Union implements mechanisms of economy policy coordination and establishes a process of cooperative European growth. In this context, European countries with a favourable economic situation should make use of the leverage available to them to expand their domestic demand, contributing to a more balanced and sustainable adjustment of the whole economy. The establishment of a Banking Union is a central pillar for fixing financial fragmentation in the euro area and breaking the link between sovereign risk and bank risk. This is a very important step towards enhanced competitiveness, given that it will make it possible for identical firms in terms of profitability and risks to have similar financing conditions, regardless of their geographical location. Moreover, structural reforms should be implemented that induce potential output growth across Europe (e.g. output market deregulation and tax system reforms). In sum:  For a successful adjustment of the Portuguese economy and to ensure its prosperity within the monetary union, certain domestic and external conditions must be established. By proving that domestic conditions are in place, external conditions will ensue and be strengthened.  In terms of domestic conditions, social cohesion must be ensured and consensus among social partners, as well as a broad consensus between political players, must be reached.  The necessary political consensus does not concern policies to be implemented but only the limits and constraints to their definition and implementation (as I have said on other occasions, although we may have different opinions on how to decorate the living room, we must admit that the living room walls are our limit and our constraint; in terms of economic policy, the walls in the exercise correspond to the external constraints placed on any given country). Thank you very much.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Patrick Honohan: The problem of mortgage arrears in Ireland Introductory statement by Mr Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the Oireachtas (National Parliament) Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Dublin, 25 September 2013. *      *      * I thank the Committee for inviting me to come to speak about the problem of mortgage arrears, and indeed I will also of course welcome the opportunity to explain the Central Bank’s policy on other matters that the Committee may wish to raise. I have previously discussed with the Committee the extremely slow progress that was being made by the banks in arresting the growth in arrears, processing the cases that had fallen into arrears and implementing sustainable solutions. Things are still not moving as quickly as the Central Bank would prefer; the indications are that the process is working, momentum is building, but there is some way to go. What is the goal of the Central Bank in addressing the problem of mortgage arrears? The Central Bank’s approach to this has been driven by both of its main regulatory objectives, prudential and consumer. The consumer protection goal – fair and reasonable treatment – has been targeted through, for example, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). The mortgage arrears targets have been crafted using the prudential powers, though there will also be a side-benefit to the consumer. Figuring out exactly how to achieve these important policy goals while working within constitutional, legal and practical realities has presented novel challenges to the Central Bank. While progress is still too slow, I am satisfied that the approach is correct and is progressively yielding results. It is almost two years since the Central Bank launched the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy which has steadily ramped up requirements on banks to improve their policies, processes and staffing around this issue in order to accelerate results on the ground. In March of this year, as part of this process, and with a view to enhancing measurability of progress, the Central Bank introduced a regime of quantitative targets for ensuring that sustainable solutions are found more quickly for distressed mortgages. The banks having reported compliance with the first quarterly set of targets, the Central Bank has started the process of auditing a sample of the cases to see whether the solutions being proposed by the banks can truly be regarded as sustainable. The internal guidelines under which this audit is being carried out have been finalized and posted on the Central Bank’s website. (They have been on the website in draft form for the past three months). What is sustainability? In a nutshell, a sustainable arrangement is one that is affordable for the borrower in both the short and the long term, and provides sufficient clarity on what happens to the collateral at maturity. The guidelines seek to put sufficient flesh on this concept to allow the criterion to be audited, while not being so restrictive as to prevent innovation in solution design. Why is initiation of legal proceedings such a big part of this exercise? The March 2013 targets document set out three modes of generating a sustainable solution. • The first, preferred, type of solution is an arrangement where payments are re-established on the original, or an agreed revised schedule. • The second mode is where the borrower opts for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement under the PIA. This was not yet available to borrowers at end-June. • The third mode, available to the bank only where an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate, involves surrender or repossession of the property. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Although each of the banks has reported compliance with the targets for end-June 2013, it is notable, though perhaps not surprising, that more than 60 per cent of this initial wave have followed the third mode.  Why have the banks relied so heavily on initiating legal proceedings in the first wave of actions under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) scheme? Subject to verification in the audit process, it is possible that most of these cases involve protracted periods of arrears with limited cooperation from the borrower notably in providing the information needed by the lender if they are to arrive at a better solution. Up-to-date borrower information provided to the lender is essential if the lender is to design a better sustainable solution potentially not involving repossession. Neither the lenders nor the Central Bank expect that repossession will be the preferred solution in the end for most of these cases. In most cases, engagement by the borrower will make the legal course unnecessary. If so, then as always the best course of action for the borrower is to start to engage by providing the necessary information to the bank to find out what better course is available. The Central Bank’s CCMA provides a strong protection framework for borrowers who engage with their lenders. Under the CCMA lenders are required to proactively engage with their customers in order to help them address the situation, they must carry out a full assessment of the borrower’s situation based on the Standard Financial Statement and each case must be examined on its individual merits. Lenders are required to explore all their options and where they do not offer an alternative repayment arrangement they must inform the borrower of the reasons for this and what alternatives are available. The CCMA provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession only where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement. Clearly, though, the Central Bank has no mandate to prevent lenders proceeding to repossession if the borrowers refuse to engage, despite the lender following the procedures mandated in the CCMA. Any bank which is proceeding lightly to legal recourse with cooperating borrowers without satisfying the procedures of the CCMA, or where alternative sustainable arrangements are available, is evidently not acting in a manner consistent with the targets regime. This should be detected through the audit and corrective action required. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  How come household debt has become such a big problem? That household mortgage debt would represent the biggest potential source of loan losses after the developer loans was evident from an early stage in the crisis. It was also clear that the problem would not emerge all at once, but would grow as distressed borrowers ran through their savings and (to the extent that unemployment was the problem) found it more difficult than they expected to secure a new job. But the ultimate scale of the problem has been hard to predict and we did not expect the banks to be so persistently ineffective in getting their arms around this problem and delivering sustainable solutions. The best available sustainable solutions can take several forms. Some merely involve identifying where the defaults are not justifiable given household resources: such borrowers need to be brought back on track. Others, especially buy-to-lets, may involve a surrender of the property to the bank or its assisted sale, with some sustainable treatment of the shortfall. In other cases, the lender cannot be confident of recovering all of the loan, but can be protected against the risk of forgiving more than is needed by the device of a split mortgage. Other schemes are possible. None of these arrangements is ideal: they generally imply a great disappointment for the borrower and a loss for the lender relative to what was originally envisaged. Debt forgiveness The Central Bank is not empowered, nor could it be, to insist on debt forgiveness for any particular borrower. Relief for an insolvent borrower from indebtedness is determined ultimately through the insolvency procedures for which legislation has so recently been reformed and in a direction which is rightly much more favourable to the insolvent debtor than was previous legislation. The Central Bank helped to advise on the drafting of this legislation and has been supportive of its aims. Use of this legislation will be an important means of ensuring that over-indebtedness problems, especially those involving multiple debtors, can be resolved. But it should be possible for lenders to avoid imposing the costs and delays of a personal insolvency arrangement (PIA) or bankruptcy on many insolvent debtors, by coming to sustainable negotiated solutions which are better for both borrower and lender. Is the split mortgage the Central Bank’s preferred outcome? Various types of solution are possible to deal with a situation where the initial repayment promise looks unsustainable. If appropriately designed – and the criteria have been set out in the Sustainability Guidelines – the split mortgage can be a sustainable solution, depending on the borrower’s circumstances. It can allow the lender to take explicit account of future improvements in the borrower’s circumstances, while providing the borrower sufficient assurance of affordability now and in the future. But it provides only one of several possible approaches. Banks have begun to experiment with other models that can give both them and the borrowers the assurance that the repayment is going to be back on a firm basis. The Committee has mentioned an approach outlined by Ulster Bank, and on the face of it that approach seems to have most of the ingredients needed to be considered sustainable. While the Central Bank has set out its sustainability guidelines, nobody, least of all borrowers, would be served by the Central Bank attempting to place a narrow straitjacket preventing innovation around possible solutions within those guidelines. Banks are beginning to learn from experience the elements that differentiate an ineffective engagement with their arrears customers, from the kind of engagement that leads to an arrangement which is not only sustainable, but is in fact sustained because it matches the borrower’s abilities and motivations. Some banks have gone further successfully down this road than others. Should the banks be doing more to achieve sustainability? Despite all of our efforts, and despite real progress in policies, processes and staffing, far too many arrears cases have still remained untreated, whether sustainably or not. For example, 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  of 98,000 personal dwelling home (PDH) accounts more than 90 days in arrears at end June, fully 74,000 – or three out of every four – were not yet in an arrangement.  Why have the banks been so slow in acting? It may be, as many have suggested, that the delay in correcting the legislative defect identified by the Dunne judgement did represent a delay – though it should not have deterred non-repossession action. The moratorium, and the CCMA restrictions designed to prevent harassment by debt collectors, likely have contributed to some delay, but have also been used as excuses. In any event, the moratorium and other CCMA rules have now been streamlined in such a way as to retain sufficient protections for distressed borrowers – a legitimate and important objective – while generating little or no obstacle to efficiently organised collection procedures. The legislative defect identified in the Dunne judgement has also eventually been corrected, as was recommended by the Central Bank. More important has been the fact that the task required a much more focused and effective organisational effort at scale than the banks at first realized, a deficiency which they have been progressively overcoming, since we started to audit and critique their procedures more intensively in 2011. I believe that there is also a gap between the analysis of the Central Bank and that of some of the banks with regard to the need for clarity and predictability about the solutions being proposed. The Central Bank wants to be sure that there is sufficient clarity about the arrangement, for example in regard to the treatment of the borrower’s liability for the shortfall in a loan following an assisted sale or repossession, or for the warehoused part of a split mortgage. Some of the banks have expressed the opinion that a degree of uncertainty about how these elements will be treated could help ensure that the bank recovers as much as possible. The Central Bank believes to the contrary that, with such a widespread systemic problem of debtor distress, greater clarity on what is residually owed in these circumstances is safer for the lender in guarding against any erosion of the debt servicing culture, as well as helping a broader restoration of household confidence which will help the wider economic recovery and through that boost loan recoverability. In particular, the Central Bank regards as unwise the creation of a situation where, because of such uncertainty, the lender and borrower hold inconsistent expectations about what will be enforced and recovered on a particular loan. Finally there has been a degree of wishful thinking, a belief that many cases will cure themselves even without energetic action by the lenders. Leaving well enough alone is not, however, an adequate approach. Delay worsens the prospects for both lender and borrower. This truism is now being acted upon more expeditiously. The Central Bank does not have executive or management control of the banks’ operations – that has to remain the responsibility of the Boards of Directors of the banks if we are to get this working properly at all. But the Central Bank is using its powers to the utmost extent to overcome the delays. The process is working; it is still too slow, but momentum is building.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  William C Dudley: Brief remarks about the centennial “The Fed at 100” Exhibit Introductory remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Museum of American Finance, New York City, 25 September 2013. *      *      * Thank you all for being here to commemorate the opening of the centennial exhibit for the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the Museum of American Finance, just a few blocks from the New York Fed’s landmark head office at 33 Liberty Street. I would like to say thank you to our friends at the Museum for their work and interest in the Fed and for supporting us in organizing this event.  Before making some brief remarks about the centennial, I would also like to acknowledge some of the people in attendance tonight. We have two former New York Fed presidents here this evening: Jerry Corrigan and Bill McDonough.  I met Jerry, the seventh president of the Bank, when I was still wet behind the ears. I was just out of graduate school at the Board of Governors in Washington, but Jerry was already a force to be reckoned with and a part of Paul Volcker’s inner circle. Jerry’s tenure as president had many memorable moments, including the October 1987 stock market “break”. Jerry, of course, was instrumental in working with then Chairman Alan Greenspan in devising a response to provide liquidity to the market, and an episode that could have ended in financial crisis soon passed. Jerry also tackled many other difficult issues during his tenure, including the Latin-American debt crisis and the development of the first Basel accord.  We also have Bill McDonough, the eighth president of the Bank, who built on the accomplishments of Jerry’s tenure, and made great strides in connecting the New York Fed to the broader region. At the same time, he helped ensure that the Federal Reserve was prepared to face new, salient challenges presented by developments in the global economic and financial landscape. During his tenure, the city, the country and the Bank experienced a very significant crisis on September 11, 2001. Under Bill’s leadership, New York Fed staff worked tirelessly on Liberty Street, supporting the efforts of first responders, while ensuring that financial markets continued to operate and serve their vital function in the U.S. and global economy.  A number of the members of our Board of Directors, including Chairwoman Rafferty, are with us, as is one of the Federal Reserve’s friends from the international central banking community: Mervyn King, the recent head of the Bank of England. Mervyn and his wife recently moved to New York City, so we should extend a warm welcome to them. For Mervyn, I am guessing that one hundred years may not seem like a long time, given that the Bank of England is over 300 years old, but I am sure he will graciously allow us our moment. We are also joined by many other friends and associates of the New York Fed, and a great number of our current and former staff.  For 100 years the Federal Reserve has been an essential contributor to American economic prosperity and stability and that record is reflected in this fascinating exhibit. Rather than focus on its achievements during my brief remarks this evening, I thought I’d highlight what I think makes the institution that I have the honor of leading, the New York Fed, such a remarkable place within this extraordinary System.  First, we are a bank within government. That means we not only have researchers, supervisors and market analysts, but we also provide banking services and possess significant operational capabilities. We accept deposits, make loans and operate the System Open Market Account for the Federal Open Market Committee. When exigent and unusual circumstances require extraordinary operations, be it in a financial crisis or to implement 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  unconventional monetary policies, we stand ready. Our operational capabilities complement our more conventional central bank policy role in a way that is, I think, very special within the Federal Reserve System. Second, the New York Fed is a vital component of the international role played by the Federal Reserve System. This can be seen in our Central Bank International Account Services, where we have more than $3 trillion in foreign assets under our management. Some of those assets glisten on the bedrock of Manhattan. The gold vault at 33 Liberty Street remains the world’s largest depository of monetary gold held on behalf of foreign governments, central banks and official international organizations. This international orientation was also very much in evidence during the crisis as we negotiated foreign exchange swap agreements with a number of foreign central banks and then operationalized the provision of dollar liquidity worldwide through a coordinated system of dollar auctions.  Third, and perhaps most importantly, we have an unusually talented and dedicated group of people working at the Bank who are committed to promoting the mission of the institution and serving the public interest. While we may not, on occasion, be as nimble as we might like, the attitude of our staff is to always find a way, to do whatever it takes (within the law and the scope of our responsibilities, of course), and to not rest until we have come up with the best plan of action. That attitude was most clearly and publicly evident during the Bank’s response to the financial crisis, where we played a critical role within the System in preventing a financial panic from turning into a world-wide depression. We continue to display that spirit each and every day at the Bank.  And it is that attitude, ability and esprit de corps that will no doubt allow us and the System to meet the important challenges on the road ahead. I will focus briefly on a few such challenges: The first will be on the monetary policy front. The Federal Reserve has engaged in a set of unconventional monetary policies in recent years. These policies have been necessary because the FOMC could not ease monetary policy further by conventional means – the federal funds rate was constrained by the so-called “zero lower bound”. Exit from these unconventional set of policies is certainly feasible – the ability to pay interest on excess reserves gives us a viable tool to manage monetary policy even with an enlarged balance sheet, and the New York Fed is prepared to execute on this mission, as we always are. But we do have to be a bit humble about what we don’t know. There will undoubtedly be communications and operational challenges and unexpected consequences. We will need to be sufficiently agile so that we can best achieve our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.  The second challenge for us at the New York Fed, and within the regulatory community more generally, will be in staying the course and implementing a regulatory regime in which no institutions are “too big to fail” (TBTF). TBTF is wrong for several reasons. It creates an unfair disparity between large and small institutions. In addition to being unfair, it creates greater risks to financial stability by encouraging greater size and complexity. We have made considerable progress toward ending TBTF – raising capital and liquidity requirements for the largest, most systemic banks – but there is a ways to go. In particular, to paraphrase former New York Fed President Tim Geithner, while the single point of entry concept “beats no plan”, significant barriers to achieving a cross border resolution remain, and there are still insufficient incentives in place for firms to take corrective actions early on to prevent their failure in the first place.  The third challenge for the Federal Reserve is to put financial stability on par with monetary policy. As our experience from 2007 to 2009 has demonstrated, monetary policy cannot work properly when there is financial instability. When financial instability occurs, it disturbs market functioning and can impair bank balance sheets in a way that disrupts their financial intermediation function, constraining the availability of credit for households and businesses. This, in turn, can lead to further reductions in aggregate demand that put additional stress on 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  the weakened financial system. Financial stability cannot be subordinated to any other priority.  The fourth challenge is to sustain and enhance the capabilities of the New York Fed. This starts most obviously in continuing to attract, develop and retain the best people. But it also extends to tending to the so-called culture of the institution – for example, ensuring that good ideas rise to the top no matter where they originate, and that people feel comfortable to challenge the conventional wisdom.  These challenges are energizing, and that’s why being president of the New York Fed is the greatest job in the world. And I am confident that, because of the talent and dedication of our staff, the New York Fed will succeed in surmounting the challenges it faces now and will face over the next 100 years.  And to drive home the point of our staff’s dedication, I would like to highlight the efforts of one person, Rosemary Lazenby, who has made this exhibit possible. Rosemary is the longest tenured employee at the Bank – 55 years – she is our resident historian and curator and she has delayed her retirement in order to develop this centennial exhibit. Her efforts are just another example of what really glistens at 33 Liberty Street (and I am not referring to the gold in our vault). Thank you Rosemary, and thank you all for coming out this this evening to enjoy the centennial exhibit.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jan Sijbrand: Ethics and the crisis in the financial sector Speech by Mr Jan Sijbrand, Executive Director of the Netherlands Bank, at the University of Groningen, Groningen, 5 September 2013. *      *      * Dear faculty, students, and staff, let me start by thanking you for the opportunity to speak at this festive opening of the academic year. When I enrolled at university to study mathematics, it had never crossed my mind that this choice might one day lead to a career in the banking sector. I just liked mathematics, is what I remember. Besides, in those days and in the first ten years or so after my graduation, banks weren’t interested in hiring mathematicians. But as in the following decades banking products grew more complex, banks began to turn their eyes to professionals with my academic specialty. So this is how, after working with Shell for a number of years, one day I switched to the financial sector, and came to join, first, Rabobank and, later, ABN Amro. And since 2011, I’ve been an executive director at De Nederlandsche Bank. Of course, it can be argued whether it was a wise decision for banks to hire mathematicians ;) I gave you this brief overview of the jobs I’ve held so far, not just to show the students among you that your professional life may turn out different from what you had in mind when choosing a particular field of study… but also to show how my career enabled me to experience and compare different organizational cultures. Most of you will know that, besides being the central bank of the Netherlands, DNB supervises the financial sector. Within the scope of that latter task, I am responsible for what we call the “prudential” supervision of banks, insurers, and pension funds. This means that we at DNB watch over the solidity of financial institutions and the financial stability of the system. This does not imply that DNB is only interested in “the numbers” – the liquidity and solvency ratios of banks. For “the numbers”, are only part of the story when things go wrong. Obviously, other factors that come into play, as the recent crisis in the financial sector has made clear. I am referring to the cases of unethical behavior of bankers that emerged during and in the wake of the crisis. Where and why did things start to go wrong? What are the possible remedies? And what is the role of DNB as prudential supervisor? These are the topics I would like to focus on today. Let me start by giving an example of unethical behavior of bankers before the crisis. Just some weeks ago, a former Goldman Sachs banker – Fabrice Tourré – was found guilty of fraud by a jury in New York City. Mr Tourré was held responsible for seriously misguiding his clients in the so-called “Abacus deal”. Abacus 2007 was the name of an investment in residential mortgagebacked securities, a product that yields income from mortgage payments by homeowners.  The deal was as follows: while Goldman Sachs sold the product, while the intermediary company that arranged the deal, Paulson & Co., went “short” on the deal. That is, they bought other products that would bring in vast amounts of money if these mortgages were to default. To make sure that this setup would work, the mortgages selected for the Abacus investment had a high chance of defaulting. Of course, the clients to whom Goldman Sachs and Paulson & Co sold this product were kept in the dark about this. In other words, what Tourré and Paulson did was seeking to maximize their profits at the expense of their clients. It is therefore hardly surprising that this scheme, once it transpired, led to a significant loss of trust in the financial sector in general. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  This example illustrates how a bank can engage in unethical behaviour by deliberately misguiding its clients, and betting against them. Let us now take a closer look at the banking business in general: where and why could things go wrong the way they did? A bank is an intermediary between people who have more money than they want to spend, and people who would like to borrow money. Put briefly, a bank’s business is to earn money with money. In some cultures and traditions this is considered inherently immoral. In our society, we find this perfectly acceptable, and even consider it indispensable for our economy to function properly. The past few years have clearly shown, however, how things can go amiss. As the former Chief Economist of the IMF, Raghuram Rajan, put it:  “Because [bankers’] business typically offers few pillars to which they can anchor their morality, their primary compass becomes how much money they can make” (Rajan 2010: 126). The question, then, is “in whose interests are banks working?” Before, say, the year 2000, banks used to focus on the interests of their clients, their employees, and their shareholders. In other words, they focused on the interests of all of their stakeholders.  But in the early years of the present millennium, their focus came to rest more and more on the interests of shareholders alone. “Managing for value” became the new creed.  As I see it, this approach made for an imbalance in bankers’ decision-making. It came to stand in the way of how banks ought to operate, and created problems for all parties involved, bankers themselves included. Let me explain how “managing for value” led to imbalanced decision-making. “Managing for value” fostered both short-term and instrumental thinking. Clients became instruments to extract money from in order to maximize profits and thus increase shareholder value. Employees were hired on the basis of their capacity to make as much money as possible and as fast as possible, rather than for their capacity to make a sustainable contribution to the bank. Bank boards cut staffing, and launched new strategies, sometimes yearly; all in order to gain and hold shareholders’ attention; not because it was in the bank’s best interest or that of its clients and employees. So, one might say that by focusing on “managing for value” only, banks lost track of what is required to maintain the right balance. Banks play a crucial role in our economy. A role that goes beyond maximizing profits for their shareholders. Banks are intermediaries: people deposit their savings at a bank, and a bank provides credit to those who need money. This is a bank’s chief task, and its main role in our economic system and in our society. It is a bank’s societal responsibility. Just like other companies – such as Shell, KPN, and Akzo Nobel – a bank, too, has a specific role to play. A bank should strive to perform this role properly, in a balanced way, in order to hold the trust of its customers and potential customers.  This trust will be eroded if a bank fails to do so and has no mechanisms is place to prevent the excesses we saw in the years before the 2008 crisis. And how serious this loss of trust can be is evident, for to this very day we are still working hard to restore trust in the financial sector. Let us now turn to the possible remedies for the gap between bankers and the rest of society; the gap that has partially been created by the unethical behavior displayed by some bankers.The first possible remedy is to criticize bankers severely and persistently. This remedy has been applied in recent years, for bankers have been “bashed” quite severely over the past years; in many cases for the right reasons. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  But, while some feel this bashing should continue until banks own up to their errors, let’s not forget that we cannot do without banks. They provide services that are vital to the functioning of a modern economy.  Also, let us bear in mind that the ongoing criticism may have a negative side-effect. As anthropologist Joris Luyendijk – who observes bankers in London’s financial district – points out: instead of subjecting themselves to self-criticism, bankers tend to grow indifferent to the public’s view.  Some even go as far as to argue that “clearly we must have done something right, now that so many people seem to be jealous of our success”. Rather than changing their ways, bankers tend to wait until the crisis and the criticism have blown over. Perhaps, they hope that once the economy picks up again, everyone will have forgiven and forgotten their errors. To quote Rajan once more: severely criticizing “the immorality of bankers has made for good rhetoric and politics throughout history, but it is unlikely to address the fundamental reason why they can do so much harm”. So, if bashing is not the solution, how then should we close this “gap” between society and bankers? Surely, a charm offensive by banks wouldn’t do the trick. Any such course would be futile, since many people distrust them too deeply for that. And “actions speak louder than words” anyway. I therefore think the best way out for bankers may instead be to quietly and properly do their job, just as society would want them to. Or should we solve this problem by establishing an “ethics office” at every bank, as is sometimes suggested? Of course, the attention we see these days for ethical dilemmas is laudable. But the risk of having a dedicated ethics office is that the rest of the organization may come to think that they no longer need to worry their heads over ethics. If this should be the effect, an ethics office would even be counterproductive. For instead of making the organization as a whole more ethical, it would prompt a “box-ticking” attitude. Therefore, rather than focusing on establishing ethics offices as a “second line of defense”, we should focus on the ethics of the “first line of defense”: the bankers themselves. Another option would be to impose more rules on the financial sector. Of course, some of the extra regulation that has been introduced was necessary. For instance, the Basel III rules which provide that capital ratios have to be raised. Yet, in my opinion, extra rules cannot solve all of our problems. For every new rule will lead to creative solutions to evade that rule. By making new rules, we won’t make bankers less greedy, nor will we make them more ethical. Instead of overregulating every detail, we should focus on the decisions bankers make. This point – how decisions are to be made – deserves to be discussed in greater detail. A bank is governed by a board of directors and by senior management. These officers decide on the bank’s strategy and key targets. Their decisions have far-reaching consequences for the bank’s operations, as the example of “managing for value” demonstrates: a misguided decision may have undesirable effects.  This considered, I would like to focus on the way bankers should make their decisions. The classical virtue “Prudentia” – in modern English, “Prudence” – can help us here. Prudentia is the virtue that stands for “making careful decisions”. It requires a capacity for reflection, careful analysis, and balanced judgment. This sounds like a goal worth striving for, but what does it mean in banking practice? In banking practice, it means that, instead of focusing on one interest in particular, bankers have to balance all of their stakeholders’ interests. They should neither focus on their shareholders alone, nor on a specific category of their clients. Bankers practicing prudence take their societal responsibility to heart, which is: to be a trustworthy intermediary. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Therefore, to be “prudent” decision-makers, bankers should: • scan which interests are at stake, • balance the different interests involved, • reflect on the consequences of their actions, • and show themselves “moderately risk-prone”. By making careful and balanced decisions, and reflecting on their societal responsibility, bankers will regain the trust they need to function optimally. What does DNB do as prudential supervisor to improve the “prudence” of bankers? In recent years, we have focused more heavily on good corporate governance, and expanded our supervisory scope to include business models, behavior and culture. By looking closely at business models, we want to increase our understanding of how banks actually make money and become better able to discern high-risk strategies. In our supervision of behavior and culture, we aim to make banks’ senior management more capable and more careful decision-makers. Let me give you two examples. First, our “fit and proper” tests for aspiring board members have become more thorough.  We have added requirements such as: • being sensitive to external developments;  • being able to take balanced decisions; • and taking responsibility for the outcomes. We have done so as we want banks to have more competent decision-makers on their boards. Second, our supervision of governance now also covers board effectiveness. We measure this aspect by observing the behaviour of board members during meetings. We analyze their performance, and reflect on the way they operate, asking challenging questions like: • Is the chairman too dominant? • Is the board really “in control”? • How does the board communicate? and • Is there room for differing points of view? • Through these new developments, we aim to foster prudent decision-making and stimulate reflection. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m going to summarize the main points of my speech. I’ve approached the theme of this gathering, “Ethics and the crisis in the financial sector”, from my perspective as executive director responsible for prudential supervision. I’ve made a case for how banks can restore confidence as an essential building block for a healthy economy. The remedy for the current confidence crisis neither lies in bashing bankers, nor in a charm offensive, nor in establishing ethics offices, nor even in imposing more rules. Bankers need to become prudent decision-makers again. This will restore the balance required for them to function optimally. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  This is how I look at the issue. I’m aware that others may hold different views and will be happy to answer questions during the panel session. Finally, I wish all students and faculty members gathered here good luck in their new academic year and hope to see some of you back at De Nederlandsche Bank one day, when your career takes you where maybe you hadn’t expected to go. ;) Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Lawrence Schembri: Born of necessity and built to succeed – why Canada and the world need the Financial Stability Board Remarks by Mr Lawrence Schembri, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the CFA Society (Ottawa), Ottawa, Ontario, 24 September 2013. *      *      * Introduction It has been just over five years since the worst days of the global financial crisis, which began with the dramatic collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. While the subsequent Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, it hardly seems over, given the slow-motion recovery of the global economy. This is especially the case in Europe and the United States, where employment has not yet returned to pre-crisis levels. Looking back at Canada’s experience of the past five years, a key lesson from the crisis is that keeping our own house in order is not enough to shelter us from global financial storms. Yes, Canada’s recovery has been stronger than virtually all other advanced economies, thanks in part to our resilient financial system. Our sound monetary, fiscal and financial sector policies protected us from the worst of the financial crisis and recession. But make no mistake: Canada was still hit hard. Output fell by 3.5 per cent. And from October 2008 to October 2009, the unemployment rate rose from 6.1 per cent to 8.3 per cent. Harder lessons were learned at the international level. The breadth and depth of the crisis, and the speed with which it travelled around the globe, made world leaders sit up and take notice. In 2009, the G-20 identified the important task of reducing the likelihood of future financial crises and limiting their spillovers across borders. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) was set up to coordinate this work.1 Today, I am going to talk about the FSB, especially its coordinating role for Canada and the global economy. I will focus on: • why the FSB is needed, • how it works, and • its accomplishments to date and plans for the future. I will also discuss implications of the FSB’s financial reform agenda for Canada. Why we need the FSB From my perspective, the FSB is a unique international organization that has certain qualities that many associate with Canadians, qualities I believe will help ensure its success in making the global financial system more resilient. A resilient global financial system is not an end in itself, but a necessary foundation for strong, sustainable and balanced global economic growth, leading to higher employment and improved living standards. The FSB was born of necessity in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Its raison d’être stems from one overarching fact: the global financial system is highly integrated.2 Financial institutions and markets are interconnected and interdependent within and across various                                                 1 The FSB grew out of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), founded in 1999 by the G-7 in the wake of the financial crises in Asia, Latin America and Russia. 2 Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane, in his 2013 speech, “Financial Stability in One Country?” argues that because of global financial integration, it is impossible to achieve financial stability in one jurisdiction by focusing exclusively on domestic considerations.

Thus, to achieve a comprehensive and coherent approach to the financial regulation and oversight necessary to attain the global public good of financial stability, coordination is essential across countries, across all of the elements of the reforms, and across many different regulators and supervisors. Failure to coordinate would lead to the fragmentation of the financial system, which would impede the global recovery. This need for effective coordination is why the G-20 established the FSB in 2009.3 What is the FSB? The FSB is not only the newest, it is by far the smallest – with only about 25 full-time staff – and probably the least well known of the major international organizations.4 These include such postwar heavyweights as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It is an international organization like no other: • Its membership is composed of national financial authorities from 24 countries, including G-20 members and other significant financial jurisdictions such as Switzerland and Singapore.5 An important innovation is that it also includes international financial institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements, as well as international bodies that set standards for banking, insurance, securities and accounting.6 • The FSB punches well above its weight by levering the knowledge of its 70 member agencies, which are home to several thousand financial sector experts. It is these experts who do most of the heavy lifting, sitting on committees and working groups to develop policy and conduct peer reviews of implementation, supported by the small FSB Secretariat. • At the FSB, decision making is based on consensus. The process of policy development allows members to input their views at each stage, thereby ensuring collective ownership of the policy decisions. The FSB relies on moral suasion, or what political scientists like to call “soft power.” As such, the FSB wields no legal sanctions but encourages countries to adhere to global standards and promotes a “race to the top” through disclosure and peer pressure. The FSB or its member standard-setting bodies regularly produce peer-led, country-by-country assessments of compliance with global standards.                                                 3 The FSB charter affirms “the FSB’s role in coordinating at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard setting bodies in developing and promoting the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of global financial stability”. See: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_120809.pdf. 4 The majority of FSB staff members are on temporary secondments from member institutions. 5 In addition to the 70 member agencies from 24 member countries, the FSB has six regional consultative groups to disseminate information and collect feedback from an additional 70 non-member countries. Broader implementation of global financial standards is important for supporting the ongoing process of global financial and economic integration. 6 These standard-setting bodies include the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  • Because the FSB is a creation of the G-20 Leaders, it has the weight of the G-20 behind it. The G-20 provides direction and receives regular progress updates from the FSB on the financial reform agenda. This close working relationship gives the FSB the political leverage it needs to be effective. In short, the FSB was designed to succeed in its coordinating role. It is an efficient and inclusive international organization that can act nimbly to coordinate the efforts needed to address serious financial vulnerabilities.7 The FSB may be small, but it is powerful, undertaking work of great significance to create a resilient, competitive and integrated global financial system, which is necessary to support a rapidly evolving global economy. Countries such as Canada, with open global financial markets and internationally active financial institutions, especially benefit from the work of the FSB. As I mentioned earlier, the FSB also embodies characteristics that are important to Canadians. It is consultative, guided by common sense and consensus; co-operative; and respectful of process. This perhaps should not be surprising, given that senior officials from the Bank of Canada and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) have played prominent leadership roles at the FSB.8 How does the FSB work? The FSB works to achieve its goal of global financial stability through four main functions, or steps, which I call the financial policy cycle: i. Identify and assess financial vulnerabilities. The recent financial crisis pinpointed several, and I will discuss those in a moment. ii. Develop the necessary policies or global standards to address these vulnerabilities. iii. Monitor the implementation of these standards by national jurisdictions to ensure consistency; and iv. Assess the effectiveness of the regulation, including any unintended adverse consequences on financial market outcomes. The FSB is organized around these four functions, with standing committees of FSB members who carry out the necessary work.9                                                 7 Working with the BCBS, the FSB was able to use its soft-power approach, including its political leverage with the G-20, to get the new Basel III capital framework developed and largely put in place in five years. In contrast, it took almost twice as long to reach the same stage with the earlier capital framework. 8 Former Bank of Canada Governor and current Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has served as the FSB Chair since November 2011; Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem was Chair of the FSB’s Standing Committee on Standards Implementation from June 2009 to April 2013; and Julie Dickson, Superintendent of OSFI, has chaired the FSB’s Committee on Supervisory Intensity and Effectiveness since its creation in 2010. See M. Carney, “Rebuilding Trust in Global Banking” (speech to the 7th Annual Thomas d’Aquino Lecture on Leadership, London, Ontario, 25 February 2013); J. Dickson, Remarks to the Institute of Internal Auditors, Toronto, 31 May 2013, and Remarks to the International Institute of Finance, Madrid, 21 May 2012; and T. Macklem, “Raising the House of Reform” (speech to the Rotman Institute for International Business, Toronto, 7 February 2012). 9 The Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities (SCAV) conducts regular monitoring exercises to identify and assess vulnerabilities; the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) decides how best to address these vulnerabilities through policy development; and the Standing Committee on Standards Implementation (SCSI) monitors implementation and assesses effectiveness. The work of these committees is directed and overseen by the Steering Committee and the Plenary, the FSB’s decision-making body. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Let me illustrate the execution of the first two steps in this policy cycle by outlining four principal weaknesses in the global financial system exposed by the financial crisis and how the FSB responded. (i) Inadequately capitalized banks In 2008, major banks in the United States, the United Kingdom and continental Europe either failed or were publicly rescued, in large part because they had insufficient levels of good-quality capital to absorb the losses incurred from taking on too much credit risk. Building more resilient banks To address this weakness and build more resilient banks, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an FSB member, developed the Basel III rules to strengthen the quantity and quality of bank capital. These rules call for more than tripling the required amount of capital.10 This updated Basel framework will be further buttressed by enhanced liquidity rules, a backstop leverage ratio similar to one that has been used in Canada, a countercyclical capital buffer and stronger supervision to enforce adoption by banks. (ii) Financial institutions that were considered “too big to fail” Large financial institutions, like Lehman Brothers and AIG, were able to take on excessive risk because they were seen as being “too big to fail.” Consequently, when risks were realized, the actual or looming failure of these institutions weakened investor confidence, spread uncertainty and severely disrupted the global financial system. To stem the massive contagion, many of these institutions had to be bailed out at taxpayers’ expense, which was patently unfair. Losses should not be socialized; they should be borne by those who profited from taking the risk. Ending “too big to fail” To end “too big to fail,” the FSB has adopted a three-pronged approach, known as the Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) framework. The three key elements in development are: • higher capital requirements for financial institutions that are deemed to be systemically important;11 • standards for the effective resolution of such institutions that eliminate the need for taxpayer bailouts and minimize the disruption to the financial system; and12 • more intense and more effective supervisory oversight. (iii) Shadow banking Credit intermediation activities outside the perimeter of traditional regulation are often referred to as “shadow banking.” I prefer to call them “market-based finance” because they include securitization, repurchase agreements (repos) and money market funds, which are                                                 10 The minimum requirement for common equity has increased from 2 per cent to 4.5 per cent, and will rise to 7 per cent when the new capital conservation buffer is added. 11 In 2011, the FSB identified an initial group of global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs). The current group of 28 global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) will be updated in November 2013. The FSB and other standard-setting bodies are extending the SIFI framework to domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). National authorities should begin to apply phase-in arrangements for the requirements for D-SIBs as of January 2016. See: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_121031ac.pdf. An initial list of global systemically important insurers was published in July 2013. 12 In 2011, the FSB published the “Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions”, which set out how authorities could resolve financial institutions in an orderly manner. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  important and useful forms of credit intermediation. If they are not properly regulated, however, these activities are subject to the same sort of systemic risks as banks, including contagious runs. The worst example from the crisis was the faulty securitization of U.S. subprime mortgages. Transforming shadow banking into more resilient market-based finance As measures are put in place to make banks more resilient, there are legitimate concerns that greater scrutiny and regulation of the traditional banking sector could result in more risky activities migrating beyond the regulatory perimeter to the shadow banking sector. First, as part of its ongoing work on vulnerabilities assessment, the FSB has established a framework for monitoring shadow banking to identify and evaluate emerging risks. Second, as part of its efforts to ensure that shadow banking is transformed into more resilient market-based finance, the FSB, at the G-20 meetings in St. Petersburg earlier this month, presented a set of recommendations for the regulation of shadow banking. These recommendations are aimed at increasing transparency, reducing moral hazard and limiting maturity and liquidity transformation, with the overall goal of striking a balance between the efficiency and competition these activities offer and the bank-like risks they pose. (iv) Critical financial markets seizing up An important example of a financial market seizing up was the US$600 trillion over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, which is a critical source of funding and risk management, especially for major financial institutions. While the OTC derivatives market was not an underlying cause of the financial crisis, its complexity, opacity and interconnectedness made the crisis worse. Creating more robust and continuous OTC derivatives markets To increase the transparency and reduce the systemic risk in these markets, the FSB has coordinated the development of policies to ensure that transactions are reported to trade repositories and that standardized OTC derivatives are cleared through central counterparties, or CCPs. A central counterparty acts as a buyer to every seller and a seller to every buyer for the financial transactions that it clears. This increases transparency and reduces counterparty credit risk.13 Next step: implementation The third step in the FSB’s policy cycle is the implementation of these global policies or standards at the national level. This is the most difficult and time-consuming step because it means taking global minimum standards or principles for financial sector regulation and adapting them for local implementation. This is where the rubber hits the road. The stated goal of the FSB is for “full, timely and consistent” implementation of global standards at the national level. Each of these adjectives is essential: they underscore the importance of a coherent and comprehensive approach to regulation to create a level regulatory playing field across jurisdictions. The FSB and its member agencies are developing a multi-year framework to monitor the implementation of these reforms. Implementation at the national level typically requires several steps, including revising existing laws or passing new legislation, and developing rules or guidelines for market                                                 13 Central counterparties concentrate and mutualize risk but don’t eliminate it. Thus, they need stringent standards for risk management and oversight. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  participants. Consistency is difficult to achieve because jurisdictions have different legal and institutional frameworks that must be modified to meet new global standards. Where is Canada in the implementation process? Because Canada’s regulatory and supervisory frameworks were relatively well developed going into the crisis, the extent of the reforms needed here is less profound, but still important. Nonetheless, Canada is leading by example. It was one of the first jurisdictions to implement the Basel III capital framework.14 At the beginning of this year, all major Canadian banks were expected to meet the stringent Basel III requirements as specified by OSFI – six years ahead of the agreed deadline of 1 January 2019.15 Canada has also made progress in addressing the problem of too big to fail. OSFI recently designated Canada’s six largest banks as domestic systemically important banks and required that they hold 1 per cent more capital and be more closely supervised.16 Market-based finance is generally viewed as less vulnerable in Canada than in other jurisdictions, and the Bank of Canada and our partner agencies want to keep it that way. To that end, we have participated fully in the FSB’s shadow banking monitoring exercise and will work together to consider how best to implement recent FSB recommendations.17,18 Finally, we have moved forward in the implementation of the G-20 commitments for OTC derivatives. In fact, the Bank of Canada has joined a multilateral arrangement for the co-operative oversight of LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear, a global central counterparty based in London, England, and the dominant counterparty for clearing Canadian interest rate swaps.19 As I noted, the Bank is working closely with other agencies at the federal and provincial levels to implement the new global standards within a framework that is best suited for Canada.                                                 14 Since the end of 2007, the major Canadian banks have increased their common equity capital by 70 per cent, or $67 billion. 15 The capital levels of Canada’s major banks are now at roughly 9 per cent or higher. Canadian banks are also moving ahead to implement the recommendations of the FSB-sponsored, private-sector-led Enhanced Disclosure Task Force. This task force is providing principles and recommendations for improved bank risk disclosures so that investors and others will have timely and useful information about the risk undertaken by banks. This report is available at: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/press/pr_121029.pdf. 16 The recent federal budget proposed that these banks would be subject to a system of bail-in debt that could be used to recapitalize them should their capital levels fall below the level of non-viability. This proposal represents an important step in implementing the FSB’s “Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions”. 17 T. Gravelle, T. Grieder and S. Lavoie, “Monitoring and Assessing Risks in Canada’s Shadow Banking Sector”, Bank of Canada Financial System Review (June 2013): 55?63. 18 Canada has gone beyond these shadow banking recommendations by establishing and promoting the use of a central counterparty for repurchase agreements to reduce counterparty and overall systemic risk and to use collateral efficiently by netting exposures. 19 As of 2 April 2013, the Bank of Canada acted under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act to designate SwapClear as systemically important. Designation brings the system under the formal oversight of the Bank of Canada. It also provides the system’s clearing and settlement rules with legal protections under Canadian law, including those pertaining to netting, finality of payment and finality of settlement. See http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2013/03/publications/press-releases/bank-canada-designates-swapclear-payment-clearing/. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Closing remarks – maintaining momentum As the dark days of the global financial crisis slowly fade in our collective memory, the real challenge is to maintain the momentum of reform, and, in particular, to confront difficult cross-border issues, especially with respect to resolving international financial institutions and regulating global financial markets. The groundwork is there. The FSB has fostered the necessary co-operation and has made solid progress in coordinating the development of appropriate global policies to address the main weaknesses exposed by the crisis. It is also pushing forward in other directions, including reforming financial benchmarks, like LIBOR, improving data collection and information exchange, and achieving a common global set of high-quality accounting standards. The G-20 Leaders have recognized the importance of the FSB’s work and last year, at the Los Cabos Summit, took steps to further strengthen the FSB’s role in coordinating the development and implementation of financial reforms.20 At the recent G-20 Summit, Leaders once again affirmed the FSB-led financial reform agenda. Nonetheless, some have argued that, given the weak recovery, now is not the time for the broad financial sector reform being promoted by the FSB. That argument is wrong-headed for several reasons. First, financial stability is an important precondition for economic growth. In particular, the countries with the strongest financial systems were the first to recover. Indeed, the experience of the United States is an important example. U.S. officials took bold measures to stress test and recapitalize their banking system. Now, they are reaping the benefits as the recovery in the United States gathers momentum. Second, the overall coherence of the reforms, their proportionality relative to the risks and their macroeconomic effects are considered before the reforms are finalized and implemented.21 Third, concerns about possible adverse effects of these reforms on the financial system and, in particular, on market functioning, are being addressed by the fourth step in the FSB policy cycle. The FSB regularly and closely monitors the effectiveness of new regulations, keeping an eye out for any material unintended consequences. As we know only too well, the global economy and, in particular, the global financial system, are highly integrated. Canada learned that lesson during the recent financial crisis, when adverse shocks spread rapidly through financial channels. We also know that the pace of global financial and economic integration will continue unabated. Thus, to ensure the resilience of the global financial system and, ultimately, of the global economy, we need a global organization that can coordinate the necessary efforts, especially across borders, to tackle emerging gaps and weaknesses in financial regulation and supervision and thereby help to prevent future crises like the one we just experienced. For this we have the FSB – a post-financial-crisis institution for a post-financial-crisis world. Thank you very much.                                                  20 The G-20 Leaders agreed that the FSB’s mandate should be strengthened; that it be given permanent legal standing; and that its capacity and resources be increased. 21 21.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Mario Draghi: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, for the Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 23 September 2013. *      *      * Madam Chair, Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a pleasure for me to be back with your committee, shortly after the important vote of your assembly on the SSM regulation. This vote has been preceded by intense interaction on the interinstitutional agreement on accountability and transparency, and I would like to thank President Schulz, your Committee and the negotiating team for the commitment to a successful establishment of the SSM. Our two institutions share a common interest in a swift and effective implementation of banking union. The draft inter-institutional agreement ensures high standards of transparency and accountability, while safeguarding the protection of confidential information. We will continue working with a similar constructive spirit in the months ahead and hope that this will allow a swift set-up of the Supervisory Board.  Today, I will first review recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area. I will then address the two topics that you have selected for our discussion: the impact of our non-standard measures; and the new tasks of the ECB in the reformed EMU architecture. Economic and monetary developments  Since our meeting in July we have received positive data for the euro area economy. Following six quarters of negative output growth, euro area real GDP rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2013. Measures of confidence and surveys of production have given some support to the view that euro area economic activity should continue its slow recovery in the current quarter, despite weak production data for July. Looking forward, economic activity should benefit from a gradual improvement in domestic demand, supported by the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance and strengthening external demand for euro area exports. However, unemployment in the euro area remains far too high, and the recovery will need to be firmly established. Annual euro area inflation declined to 1.3% in August 2013, down from 1.6% in July. Underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. Medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability. The risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term.  Monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. The annual rate of change of loans to the private sector and, notably, to firms weakened further in July. Weak loan dynamics continue to reflect the current stage of the business cycle but also heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of borrowers and lenders. The significant improvement in the funding situation of banks since the summer of 2012 has not yet fed through into higher credit provision.  Review of recent monetary policy decisions  Against this background, the Governing Council has pledged to maintain monetary policy accommodative for as long as necessary. In order to re-affirm and clarify this conditional 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches pledge, in a context of volatile money market interest rates, the ECB has introduced forward guidance in July, stating that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation, which has been reconfirmed in August and September, is based on a subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. We will maintain the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and aim at promoting stable money market conditions. To ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in the broader economy, it is essential that effective measures be taken to further reduce fragmentation of euro area credit markets and to strengthen the resilience of banks where needed. Monetary policy contributes to these objectives, but it can only address impairments in transmission insofar as they are not related to more structural barriers. By giving unlimited access to central bank refinancing against adequate collateral, our non-standard measures have been pivotal in relieving bank funding stress. The collateral framework has been adjusted as necessary to ensure continued adequate risk protection for the ECB’s balance sheet, while at the same time promoting transparency, for example in markets for structured finance products. Ensuring that solvent banks remain liquid has contributed to avoiding an abrupt deleveraging which would have deeply damaged the economy.  The Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) announced a year ago have prevented risks of destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for price stability in the euro area. OMTs serve as a fully effective backstop, within the ECB’s mandate, and under formal conditionality so as to preserve the appropriate incentives for governments to ensure fiscal solvency and adopt those structural policies that can put the economy on a sustainable path.  Over the past twelve months, confidence in the euro area has returned. As a consequence, fragmentation in euro area funding markets has been receding. This improvement owes not only to the ECB’s non-standard measures, but also to progress by governments in improving the euro area governance and in pursuing reform agendas. Deposit outflows from stressed countries have been reversed. Market access for banks has improved. Reliance on ECB funding support has been steadily declining. These improvements are reflected primarily in the on-going advance repayments of funds by several banks which had borrowed from the ECB under the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations. While repayment of central bank credit is certainly a sign of normalisation, the resulting reduction in excess liquidity can reinforce upward pressures on term money market rates. We will remain particularly attentive to the implications that these developments may have for the stance of monetary policy. The tasks of the ECB in the reformed EMU architecture  Let me finally address the tasks of the ECB in the reformed EMU architecture. The Maastricht set-up has been substantially strengthened since the start of the crisis. Europe has reinforced fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance, created a permanent crisis management mechanism, the ESM, and has improved its institutional framework. It is moving swiftly towards the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) for banks in the euro area. A key priority of the agenda for the last quarter of 2013 is to complement it by a Single Resolution Authority and Single Resolution Fund as proposed by the European Commission. The ECB strongly supports the envisaged timeline for the establishment of the SRM by 1 January 2015, which adequately reflects the urgency.  Let me make a few remarks on the specific role of the ECB in the progress towards a fully-fledged banking union. Already in 2010, with the decisive contribution of your institution, the ESRB was created to oversee macro-prudential risks in the financial system as a whole. The ECB ensures the Secretariat and thereby provides support to the ESRB. This year, a further-reaching step is being made with the imminent launch of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The ECB is fully committed to assume its new responsibilities and to discharge accountability 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 accordingly. Preparatory work has started in order to ensure that the new tasks are performed at the highest level of effectiveness and professionalism.  While synergies between the new supervisory and existing monetary policy functions exist, the ECB will strictly respect the principle of separation between monetary policy and banking supervision, as foreseen in the SSM Regulation. Such separation will ensure that the ECB will continue to fulfil its primary mandate of price stability in complete independence, in line with the Treaty.  The effective separation of monetary policy and bank supervision decisions will be implemented both at the decision making level and at the technical staff level. A separate Supervisory Board will be created to draft and enforce decisions. Furthermore, deliberations of the Governing Council on supervisory matters will be strictly separated from monetary policy decisions. This separation between the two tasks will be underpinned by separated agendas and meetings.  Finally, let me say a few words on the involvement of the ECB in the troika. Back in 2010, we were asked by the Council to provide our technical expertise to the design and monitoring of EU/IMF financial assistance programmes. In the meantime, the ECB has been allocated a number of specific tasks by the ESM Treaty and EU secondary legislation. We act in liaison with the Commission to provide technical advice, based on our expertise. As we have done in the past, we remain ready to share our views on the situation in programme countries with the European Parliament and to explain the advice provided as part of the troika. However, it is important to recall that the Eurogroup is the body which actually decides whether to grant financial assistance and under which terms.  Thank you for your attention. I am now looking forward to your questions.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Thomas Jordan: Monetary policy and the business cycle Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the KOF Swiss Economic Institute, Zurich, 23 September 2013. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Monetary policy contributes to the prosperity of an economy by ensuring price stability in the medium and long term. This makes it possible to put resources to more efficient use, from an economic point of view, and also promotes investment and, with it, long-term growth. Price stability also helps to avoid undesirable distribution effects. Households with lower incomes derive particular benefit from this. Monetary policy can be used to dampen cyclical fluctuations. However, it is not suitable for short-term fine-tuning of the economy. From the point of view of the business cycle, the goal of monetary policy must rather be the reduction of larger risks and the alleviation of extreme situations. An example of one such measure is the minimum exchange rate, which the Swiss National Bank (SNB) set on 6 September 2011 to halt the Swiss franc's upward trend, thus averting a deflationary spiral and warding off the danger of a serious economic crisis. Monetary policy decisions are always subject to uncertainty. It is therefore of key importance that the SNB has a sound decision-making basis. To this end, it uses a variety of models and empirical approaches, and also conducts its own surveys. In addition, the SNB analyses economic indicators for Switzerland and abroad, and follows the assessments and forecasts of other institutions. KOF Swiss Economic Institute at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology Zurich (ETH) is without doubt the best-known for economic analysis. It makes a significant contribution towards understanding the Swiss economy with its regular data surveys (for example, the survey of companies it has been systematically conducting since 1955), as well as its economic forecasts and special analyses. In doing so, KOF fulfils an important role for the SNB's monetary policy and, ultimately, for the greater good of our country. For this reason, the SNB has been connected with the KOF Swiss Economic Institute since its beginning in the 1930s. Both institutions maintain a stimulating exchange of information and ideas to this day. With high-quality economic analysis closely linked to scientific research, KOF Swiss Economic Institute will continue to make a valuable contribution in future - to ensure an even better understanding of the Swiss economy.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ardian Fullani: Strengthening linkages in South East Europe. Policy anchors and business perspectives Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the joint conference of the Bank of Albania and the University of Oxford “Strengthening linkages in South East Europe. Policy anchors and business perspectives”, Tirana, 19 September 2013. *      *      * Your Excellency Prime Minister of Albania, Honourable guests from the University of Oxford,  Dear representatives of the diplomatic corps and academia, dear participants,  I have the pleasure and honour to open this joint conference of the Bank of Albania and the University of Oxford, on strengthening the linkages between the economies in our region. Three years ago, in September 2010, we invited the University of Oxford to support the academic discussion of the Bank of Albania on the economic growth model and its regional character. At that moment, this debate was misinterpreted as a discussion on the advantages of the market economy and alternative philosophies of the economic organisation of a society. Nonetheless, after three years, we all find that the economic growth model has become the main topic of academic, economic and political debate. For a number of years, our economy has been under the grip of the global crisis, reflected mainly in a decelerated economic activity. Consequently, investments and lending to the economy slowed down, deteriorating, at the same time, the private and public sector balances. In spite of these developments, the Albanian economy has managed to maintain price stability and the overall macroeconomic and financial balances. The Albanian financial system has proven highly immune. Despite the economic growth slowdown, overall, this system remains liquid, well capitalised and profitable, reflecting the prudent work of the Bank of Albania over the pre-crisis years. Bank of Albania’s prudent policies and the reaction of the banking sector enabled the system to avoid extreme problems, which would require the use of public funds. We should bear in mind that various banking groups from EU countries, heavily hit by the crisis, operate in Albania.  The stability of the banking sector has been at the heart of work of the Bank of Albania, focusing on both financial stability and banking supervision, and on monetary policy and liquidity management. The Bank of Albania has been proactive and has anticipated problems, aligning itself and the role of its policies with global developments and the domestic market state of affairs.  The dim global financial and economic situation has dictated the need to redefine the role of institutions, including the central bank. Presently, the central banks have turned to macroprudential measures, because the traditional mechanisms of monetary policy transmission are suffering from burdened balance sheets of the private and public economic agents. To better coordinate this role and monitor the economy, central banks around the world are supporting their monetary policy with the necessary macroprudential measures. These global developments find the Bank of Albania well prepared and equipped with the required experience. Its structure is similar to the one being adopted by the European Central Bank and other central banks in developed countries. Moreover, the Bank of Albania has now several years of successful experience in employing countercyclical measures to manage the country’s macroeconomic and financial equilibrium. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches I would like to underscore the change of risk coefficients for controlling the expansion of lending in foreign currency, and the introduction of limits of credit to collateral ratio for controlling the size of debt in the economy…. to mention just a few. One of the most important lessons from the global crisis is that addressing the monetary stability (i.e. price stability) and financial stability issues independently does not provide an optimal solution and is crisis-prone. The economy functions as a complex mechanism with often fragile and interdependent equilibria, which do not respect boundaries of institutional responsibilities. For each economy, there is only one interest rate, only one critical mass of financial intermediation and a fragile equilibrium of financial sector balances that guarantee sustainable and long-term development for the country. Harmonising these three objectives is a prerequisite for maintaining the financial equilibrium of the economy. Therefore, their identification and harmonisation under one roof is considered as the optimum solution to guarantee the country’s economic and financial stability. For that reason, one of the most pursued practices for post crisis institutional regulation is not only unification of supervisors of the financial system, but also their institutional integration with other functions of the central bank.  *** Your Excellency Prime Minister of Albania, Dear participants, Unquestionably, in the long term, economic growth of a country is determined by the labour force and its qualification, productivity, technology and innovation capacities; as well as the capital accumulation scale, which in itself, reflects both social preferences and fiscal stimuli and the development level of the financial system. These three sets of factors are conditioned by the economic structure of a country and they are encouraged and stimulated through structural reforms. Again, in the long term, economic growth is determined only by the structural reforms and the degree of competitiveness of our economy vis-à-vis our trading partners and the global market. On the other hand, the duty of the fiscal and monetary policies is to avoid short-term deviations of the economy from this long-term trend and create a sustainable environment for the country’s economic and financial development.  The Albanian economy has already started its journey towards integration with the European Union. The ultimate goal of this process is to improve the economic welfare. It also implies to fully integrate with the trading, industrial and financial chains; adopt a unique economic management philosophy, a unique regulatory and institutional practice; and acknowledge the harmonised rules of the game applied throughout the European area.  In this context, I would like to highlight two key moments:  First, the European integration process should be our strongest anchor for structural reforms: legal, regulatory, institutional, infrastructural, or political ones. Albania has still a long way to go and the peculiarities of our economy provide the necessary space to calibrate these models in accordance with the comparative advantages and primary needs of the country. However, I believe it would be useful to have all the reforms integrated in a unique vision of integration.   Second, the Albanian businesses should do a lot more to hasten the integration process. It should be more active to adopt advanced technologies, and production and management processes.   Likewise, the Albanian financial sector should be more visionary in its policies and priorities about the distribution of financial resources, and work harder to attract more foreign investments and build bridges of cooperation with local businesses.  We have rightly underlined that regional cooperation is a necessary move that should precede the European integration process. The economies of the region are small compared 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 to our trading partners, but the establishment of unified zones in terms of customs duties, legal systems and practices, integration of financial practices and development policies provides the right incentives to attract foreign investments and empower our negotiation capacities with international partners.  *** Concluding, I would like to reiterate that the Bank of Albania considers the economic and financial stability of the country as a prerequisite for sustainable and long-term development. Now, this is no longer a theoretical matter of disciplining the behaviour of politics towards the economy, nor is it a discussion on respecting the equality of generations. It is a bitter lesson learned from the latest crisis and a tangible reality for many countries of the euro area. We have persistently invited policymakers and economic agents in the country to partake in this vision. As the country’s monetary authority mandated to guarantee price stability, we have worked and will continue to do so to ensure a low-inflation environment. This environment boosts the guarantees for savers and investors for their long-term plans and provides for financial system development. The Bank of Albania implements a modern monetary policy based on the most advanced principles of central banking, and employs instruments and communication approach in line with ECB practices. The commitment of the Bank of Albania to maintain price stability is the polar star of our work. Drafting and implementing the monetary policy independently, exclusively in the function of price stability, is one of the domestic anchors of the Albanian economy, which should be preserved and strengthened. In parallel, the Bank of Albania deems that the Albanian economy needs two additional anchors: financial stability and fiscal stability. Our regulatory and supervisory function over the banking system, which accounts for 95% of the financial system in Albania, has proven successful in guaranteeing the country’s financial stability. This function has been carried out and is discharged in line with the international best practices, in constant cooperation with homologous institutions and other international partners.  The possibility to have an integrated vision of economic and financial developments, and to combine but not mix the monetary policy with macroprudential measures, has enhanced the effectiveness of Bank of Albania’s actions, and has contributed to better achieving the two individual objectives: financial stability and price stability. The institutional regulation, which has proven effective and is in line with the latest global trends, should continue to function as a second anchor of domestic economic anchors.  Finally, the Bank of Albania deems that Albania should immediately establish not only a clear and transparent fiscal rule, but also an effective one to discipline the fiscal policy and maintain the trust of financial markets in public finance soundness. This third anchor would complete the framework of domestic anchors of economic policy. Together with the close cooperation with international financial institutions, it would provide a consistent and transparent framework for the country’s development. Provision of liquidity and solvency of the Albanian economy through bilateral and multilateral partnerships is a priority for central bank policies. This vision and partnership should become the axis of cooperation between national institutions.   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Louis Kasekende: Financial stability – restructuring and resolution of financial institutions Speech by Dr Louis Kasekende, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the Bank of Uganda–Deutsche Bundesbank seminar on “Financial stability – restructuring and resolution of financial institutions”, Kampala, 3 July 2013. *      *      * Distinguished Guests  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  On behalf of Bank of Uganda, I wish to formally welcome you all to this seminar with the underlying theme “Financial Stability – Restructuring and Resolution of Financial Institutions”.  This seminar is occurring under the Bank of Uganda and the Deutsche Bundesbank technical cooperation. The main objective is to strengthen the Resolution framework for dealing with banks and financial conglomerates. This initiative emerged from the recommendations of the IMF Regional Crisis Preparedness Mission of February 2011 and the FSAP Mission of August 2011. Both these missions recommended that Bank of Uganda reviews the Bank Resolution framework and in addition, ensure that it conforms to the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) guideline on Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions.  At the Seoul Summit on 11–12 November 2010, the G20 Leaders endorsed the FSB policy framework for reducing the moral hazard of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). This framework called for action in five areas, of which a key area was to make improvements to resolution regimes so that any financial institution, whatever its size and complexity, can be resolved without disruption to the financial system. The Key Attributes of Effective Resolution regimes for Financial Institutions outline the policy framework to meet this objective. These key attributes have been identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) jointly with its members including the IMF, World Bank and the standard-setting bodies.  The purpose of an effective resolution regime is to make possible the resolution of financial institutions without severe system-wide disruption. Such a resolution regime needs to take into account the taxpayers, and minimize the losses to them, while protecting vital economic functions. It should employ mechanisms which make it possible for shareholders and unsecured and uninsured creditors to absorb losses in a manner that respects the hierarchy of claims in liquidation. Finally, the resolution regime should provide for timely and early entry into resolution before a firm is balance-sheet insolvent and before all equity has been fully depleted. These attributes set out the responsibilities, instruments and powers that national regimes should have to resolve failing financial institutions, some of which may be systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).  Any financial institution that may be systemically significant or critical if it fails should be subject to a resolution regime and to this effect, the FSB Key Attributes help to address one of the key themes of “too-big-to-fail” in global finance by making it possible to resolve any financial institution in an orderly manner, regardless of the size and complexity of the financial institution.  Two key themes emerge in this overarching area of resolution of SIFIs; one, resolution authority, powers and hierarchy of stakeholders and two; the detailed mechanisms for resolution such as the collateralization, safeguards and funding of firms in resolution.  For resolution to be feasible, the authorities should have the required legal powers and the operational capacity to apply them in order to ensure the continuity of functions that are 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches significant to the economy. The mechanisms employed in resolving problematic firms should follow the “Respect of creditor hierarchy” and “no creditors worse off than in liquidation” principle’ as laid down in the FSB Key Attributes. In other words, resolution powers should be exercised in a way that respects the hierarchy of claims while providing flexibility to depart from the general principle of equal treatment of creditors of the same class. In particular, equity should absorb losses first, and no loss should be imposed on senior debt holders until subordinated debt has been written-off entirely. Creditors should have a right to compensation where they do not receive at a minimum what they would have received in a liquidation of the firm under the applicable insolvency regime. Directors and officers of the firm under resolution should be protected in law, for instance, from law suits by shareholders or creditors for actions taken when complying with decisions of the resolution authority. I hope that the first training session this morning on the institutional framework within the EU and the sharing session on Thursday about the German Bank Restructuring Act will shed light on some of these issues.  Second key issue is that there is a need to put in place pre-determined methods of resolution, sources of funding and identified assets acceptable as collateral against such emergency funding in a crisis. Most importantly, authorities should have statutory or other policies in place so that authorities are not constrained to rely on public ownership or bail-out funds as a means of resolving firms. Therefore, in support of the preparations of recovery and resolution plans and the effective implementation of resolution measures in a crisis, a framework should be developed in advance. As they say, it is already too late to dig a well when you are thirsty. These are some of key issues which have prompted international best practices in the area of resolution regimes, and we are looking forward to understanding these from the historical examples and restructuring case studies that will be shared during the training seminar.  The G20 and the FSB are calling on countries to undertake the reforms necessary to implement these standards. In Uganda, this will require cooperation amongst authorities, that is, among the Bank of Uganda, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, the Insurance Regulatory Authority and the Capital Markets Authority, to review business structures, legal powers, policies and operations to improve recovery and resolution planning as well as the mechanisms employed in resolution of firms. Therefore, as a capstone, I am glad that the participants will also have the opportunity to do some hands-on decision making in the group exercises at the end of each day.  Over the course of the next three days, the team from Deutsche Bundesbank which includes Mr. Peter Spicka and Mr. Martin Pontzen, with their wealth of experience will be taking us a step further towards these areas. I believe that the seminar will be enriching as they share their experience in Europe on relevant areas including the analytical tools for macroprudential supervision. Of particular importance will be the section where the seminar goes into the details of international and European initiatives for developing efficient resolution frameworks for financial institutions and explains fundamental features of the German Bank Restructuring Act.  I hope that this seminar, bringing all the players in the financial sector together, will help to facilitate sharing of ideas and experience and will promote the development of an effective framework for the restructuring and resolution of financial institutions, especially SIFIs so as to safeguard financial stability in Uganda. I am very grateful for the opportunity to have addressed you this morning. Thank you very much. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Daniel K Tarullo: Macroprudential regulation Speech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Yale Law School Conference on Challenges in Global Financial Services, New Haven, Connecticut, 20 September 2013. *      *      * Real world crises have a way of shaking up the intellectual foundations of policy disciplines. Elements of received wisdom are undermined, while certain heterodox or less mainstream views are seen as more valid or important than had been widely recognized. The financial crisis of 2007–2009 was no exception. Some ideas, such as the efficient markets hypothesis, have taken some hits, as others have risen to prominence. An example of the latter is the view that financial stability must be an explicit economic policy goal. A corollary of this view is that a “macroprudential” perspective – generally characterized as focused on the financial system as a whole as opposed to the well-being of individual firms – should be added to traditional prudential regulation. A single speech cannot hope to touch on, much less do justice to, the many theoretical and policy issues encompassed by the term macroprudential. In my remarks this afternoon I will focus principally on the project of recasting the regulation and supervision of large financial firms so as to realize the macroprudential objective of reducing systemic risk. Specifically, I will offer five propositions that I think should guide this project over the next couple of years. In so doing, I will explain some of the key steps that have already been taken and identify some priorities that remain, though even here I do not pretend to comprehensiveness. Before addressing the macroprudential dimension of regulating large financial firms, however, let me provide some context by briefly reviewing the evolving idea of macroprudential policy. Macroprudential policy Although the crisis and its aftermath have created a broader consensus for the proposition that financial stability should be a more explicit objective of economic policy, there is considerably less convergence around theories of, metrics for, and policy prescriptions to promote, financial stability. Policy and academic writing generally limits the term “macroprudential” to measures directed specifically at countering risks in the financial system that, if realized, can severely impact real activity.1 But adoption of consistent terminology does not itself resolve questions of whether, for example, increases in systemic risk are endogenous to the financial system and thus follow a somewhat regular cyclical pattern, or are instead somewhat randomized, albeit repeated, phenomena.2  Differences in views of the origins of systemic risk obviously affect views of the best ways to measure it and, of course, the best policies to contain it. One example, of particular interest to central bankers, is the ongoing debate about the circumstances under which monetary policy should be adjusted to take account of financial stability concerns. Lying behind the                                                 1  Thus, for example, fiscal or tax policies would not be generally characterized as macroprudential tools, even though they could have implications for systemic risk in some circumstances. For useful overviews of macroprudential policy issues and debates, see International Monetary Fund (2011), “Macroprudential Policy: An Organizing Framework (PDF),” (Washington: International Monetary Fund, March 14); Gabriele Galati and Richhild Moessner (2011), “Macroprudential policy – a literature review (PDF),” BIS Working Paper No. 337 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, February). 2  For a recent study finding a correlation between the growth of credit aggregates and financial crises, and also suggesting a secular trend making such crises more of a risk, see Moritz Schularick and Alan M. Taylor (2012), “Credit Booms Gone Bust: Monetary Policy, Leverage Cycles, and Financial Crises, 1870–2008,” American Economic Review, vol. 102 (2), pp 1029–61. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  various positions in this debate are differing views on how systemic risk propagates, and thus on the relative efficacy of monetary versus macroprudential policies. Progress in these debates is complicated by the fact that, by definition, financial stability policies are directed toward preventing or mitigating rare events, rather than outcomes such as inflation and unemployment that are continuously observable. This focus on tail risks raises important issues of accountability in the institutional design of macroprudential policies and also complicates the task of testing financial stability theories and proposed policies. Yet even against the backdrop of what is still a comparatively underdeveloped understanding of financial stability,3 commentators and policymakers have compiled and, in some cases, developed so-called “toolkits” of possible macroprudential measures. These measures are thought available for use against one or both of two frequently identified dimensions of systemic risk: procyclicality and interconnectedness.4 Of course, the attractiveness of many of these tools will depend on one’s views of a variety of theoretical, institutional, and practical questions. The tools identified can be variously categorized. One useful distinction is between measures designed to prevent systemic risk from building (often termed “lean-against-the-wind” measures) and those designed to increase the resiliency of the financial system should systemic risk nonetheless build sufficiently that broad-based stress ensues. Another distinction is between time-varying and time-invariant measures, with the former based on a response – either discretionary or in accordance with a rule – to some measured increase in risk. Macroprudential foundation for the regulation of large banking organizations It is worth noting that the term “macroprudential regulation” can be found in Bank for International Settlements (BIS) documents beginning more than 30 years ago. It appears to have originated in specific contrast to traditional banking regulation, which a 1979 background paper at the BIS characterized as focused on “sound banking practice and the protection of depositors at the level of the individual bank.”5 In fact, much of the New Deal legislation that would define the financial regulatory structure for more than 40 years was in direct response to what we would today call systemic concerns, including banking panics and excessive leverage in equity markets.6 In the late 1970s, though, there was indeed reason for the development of an explicitly macroprudential perspective. The New Deal regulatory system was beginning to break down in the face of profound changes in financial markets, most importantly the progressive integration of capital market and traditional lending                                                 3  There is actually quite a rich history of policy measures in the United States that we would today call “macroprudential.” See Douglas J. Elliott, Greg Feldberg, and Andreas Lehnert (2013), “The History of Cyclical Macroprudential Policy in the United States,” Finance and Economics Discussion  Series 2013–29 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May). It is notable that the enactment and use of a number of tools waned as the integration of capital markets with traditional lending functions accelerated in the last quarter of the 20th century, though even if there is a causal relationship between these two phenomenon, it is not clear which way the causality runs (perhaps in both directions). 4  The terminology may differ among commentators. For example, “cross-sectional” is sometimes used in place of interconnectedness, a term that may have some appeal to the extent it moves away from the traditional domino image of one failing firm knocking down another, and also embraces dynamics such as contagion across the financial system arising from correlated asset holdings and sources of funding. 5  Piet Clement (2010), “The term ‘macroprudential’: origins and evolution (PDF),” BIS Quarterly Review (March), pp. 2–3. 6  The establishment of federal deposit insurance and the separation of commercial banking from investment banking – two key elements of New Deal financial reforms – were very much directed at what would today be characterized as systemic risks. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  activities. The forms of regulation that were evolving as substitutes – principally, though not only, minimum capital requirements – were largely based on what various BIS papers characterized as a microprudential approach to regulation. It is, however, equally worth noting that the use of the term macroprudential – and, it would seem, the influence of the concerns lying behind the term – was somewhat irregular in the three decades after it was coined. Discussion of the concept and its implications for regulation was more likely to be found in the papers of a few academics and intrepid BIS researchers than in the pronouncements of senior regulators or other official sector representatives. One important exception is a speech delivered in September 2000 by the late Andrew Crockett, then the General Manager of the BIS.7 For several reasons, that speech is a good point of reference for us today – as a nod to Sir Andrew’s foresight, as an occasion for regret that his words were not more closely heeded by regulators,8 and as a way of illustrating how the challenge of macroprudential financial regulation has grown in the years since. Sir Andrew’s speech contained much that is now familiar and broadly accepted, but was fairly uncommon at the time: He distinguished between the objectives of microprudential regulation – protecting against idiosyncratic risk in a bank – and macroprudential regulation – protecting against systemic risk. He set forth a description of the financial cycle that could be read as a loose paraphrase of Hyman Minsky’s theory of financial instability.9 He identified the procyclical and asset-correlation concerns regarding large bank activities that have commanded so much attention in the past several years. And, again foreshadowing many recent discussions, he suggested macroprudential tools both to increase resiliency (as through capital regulation with a systemic perspective) and to lean against the wind in an effort to slow or limit the growth of unsustainable asset bubbles (as through maximum loan-to-value ratio requirements). The Crockett speech holds up very well today. With the benefit of the experience gained from the intervening financial crisis, an intense period of analysis from a macroprudential perspective, and a variety of regulatory initiatives, I offer these five propositions both to reinforce and to supplement the views Sir Andrew expressed 13 years ago. Five propositions for a macroprudential approach to regulating financial institutions 1. A Macroprudential Perspective Should Dominate the Regulation and Supervision of Large Financial Institutions. Sir Andrew entitled his speech “Marrying the Micro- and Macro-Prudential Dimensions of Financial Stability,” suggesting an equal partnership between the two regulatory dimensions, as he called them. My own sense is that we need to concentrate our post-crisis efforts to reshape the regulation and supervision of large financial institutions                                                 7  Andrew D. Crockett, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements and Chairman of the Financial Stability Forum (2000), “Marrying the Micro- and Macro-Prudential Dimensions of Financial Stability (PDF),” speech delivered at the Eleventh International Conference of Banking Supervisors in Basel, Switzerland, September 21. 8  Reading between the lines, one wonders whether Sir Andrew anticipated that his call for action might not be taken up by banking regulators. He styled his remarks as “provocative” and concluded by suggesting they were but “a small awareness-raising step in what, if pursued, is likely to be a long road.” 9  Crockett, 2000 speech: “A review of the instances of financial instability would reveal some shared stylised elements. There is first an over-extension phase during which financial imbalances build up, accompanied by benign economic conditions. In this phase, asset prices are buoyant and their surge tends to feed, and be fed by, rapid credit expansion, domestically or internationally. Leverage, in overt or hidden forms, accumulates in balance sheets, masked in part by the favourable asset price developments. The trigger for a reversal is essentially unpredictable. It can originate either in the financial sphere (e.g., an asset price correction) or in the real economy (e.g., a spontaneous unwinding of an investment boom). The process then moves into reverse. Ex post, a financial cycle is evident.” 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  on measures reflecting the macroprudential dimension, at least for a time. This view is consistent with the Congressional emphasis on financial stability and systemic risk considerations in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.10  To be sure, idiosyncratic problems such as certain operational risks may threaten large institutions, and traditional regulation and supervision surely have an important ongoing role to play. But the dynamics observed during the financial crisis of highly correlated asset holdings, shared risks, and contagion among the largest firms suggest that the well-being of any one of these firms cannot be considered in isolation from the well-being of the system as a whole. Severe problems at such institutions are far more likely to arise from vulnerabilities to common stresses, and severe problems at such firms are far more likely to exacerbate systemic weaknesses. Since the health of any one of these large institutions is tied to the health of these firms as a group, good microprudential regulation may itself require a macroprudential dimension. The reorientation of the Federal Reserve’s supervision of large, complex financial firms is reflected organizationally in the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC). The LISCC was created three years ago to facilitate the execution of horizontal, cross-firm analysis of the largest firms and to centralize supervision of these firms so as to promote an integrated and consistent supervisory approach. The LISCC includes senior staff not only from the supervisory staffs of the Board and Reserve Banks, but also from the Board’s Office of Financial Stability, Division of Monetary Affairs, Division of Research and Statistics, and other relevant divisions. This “interdisciplinary” approach to large bank supervision not only fosters more rigorous microprudential regulation, it also facilitates and formalizes a broader look at systemic risks by using quantitative methods to evaluate macroeconomic and financial risks, and how they could affect individual firms and the firms collectively. 2. Building Greater Resiliency is Central to the Macroprudential Regulation of Large Financial Institutions. In early 2009 there was widespread doubt about the solvency of the financial system as a whole, particularly at many of the large firms that had directly or indirectly been deeply involved in mortgage markets and associated securitizations. When we created the first supervisory stress test on the fly, as it were, our aim was to stabilize, and restore confidence in, the financial system as a whole by ensuring that the 19 largest bank holding companies were sufficiently capitalized that they could continue serving as viable financial intermediaries. So the focus on resiliency was initially a matter of necessity. But there is also logic to making the resiliency of the largest firms the most important part of our ongoing macroprudential regulatory agenda. Just as a microprudential approach to regulation has come to emphasize building up capital because it makes the individual firm better able to absorb losses from any source, including unpredictable ones, so an appropriately refocused set of macroprudential capital requirements can help make the financial system better able to withstand shocks from unanticipated, as well as familiar, sources. As mentioned by Andrew Crockett, a macroprudential perspective suggests two ways in which resiliency should be strengthened: the first is to treat the financial system as a whole as the “portfolio” of assets subject to safety and soundness oversight; the second is to apply stricter regulations on firms of systemic importance whose failure would carry a good chance of endangering the entire system. In the last four years, we have developed both kinds of measures to increase resiliency. Following our use of stress tests of the nation’s 19 largest bank holding companies in the midst of the crisis, Congress included in the Dodd-Frank Act a requirement of annual                                                 10  Elsewhere I have discussed this emphasis at some length. See Daniel K. Tarullo (2012), “Financial Stability Regulation,” speech delivered at the Distinguished Jurist Lecture, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Philadelphia, PA, October 10. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  supervisory stress tests for a larger group of firms: all those with greater than $50 billion in assets. These stress tests, and an associated supervisory review of the capital processes and practices of the covered firms, have in just a few years become a core part of the oversight of these large firms. Our stress testing program is one form of the first type of macroprudential resiliency measure. It also provides a good example of how sound microprudential regulation of the largest banking firms can be difficult to distinguish from regulation with a macroprudential orientation. Conventional capital requirements are by their nature somewhat backward-looking, reflecting loss expectations based on past experience and loss recognition that often occurs well after the likelihood of loss has become clear. Rigorous stress testing helps compensate for these shortcomings through a forward-looking assessment of the losses that would be suffered under stipulated adverse economic scenarios, so that capital can be built and maintained at levels high enough for the firms to withstand such losses and still remain viable financial intermediaries. This forward-looking aspect of stress testing automatically builds capital, and boosts resilience, in the face of weakening loan-underwriting standards because, for any given adverse scenario, weaker underwriting standards will imply higher losses. Also, because the firms are stressed simultaneously, supervisors are able to identify and take account of correlated exposures and other common risks.11 The firms covered by the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests account for more than 70 percent of U.S. banking sector assets, thus approaching Sir Andrew’s standard of a supervisory perspective that examines the assets of the financial system as a whole. The effectiveness of stress testing as a macroprudential tool depends, of course, on how the tests are constructed. For example, a macroprudential perspective must inform the construction of the scenarios against which the assets and revenues of the banks are stressed. Such a perspective argues for incorporating particular risks to the financial system even when there is some uncertainty regarding the probability of a particular risk being realized. For example, the scenario might include a sharp drop in house prices if analysis suggested – but did not confirm – that there was overheating in the housing market, and if supervisors judged that large banks had correlated exposures to the housing sector. That is, the stress tests provide for resiliency in the event the risk comes to pass, without necessarily requiring other measures to restrict directly the lending or other activity lying behind the risk. A macroprudential perspective also counsels against injecting more procyclicality into the financial system by, for example, simply assuming a standard deterioration in economic conditions from whatever the baseline projections might be. Such an approach would overlook the tendency of systemic risk to build during strong, prolonged expansions, when underwriting standards decline, rising asset prices make secured lending seem safer, and defaults wane. The approach we are instead taking is that, under such conditions, our severely adverse scenario would assume a level of unemployment during the stress period comparable to that observed in past severe recessions, not simply an increase in unemployment comparable to the increase observed during those recessions.12 Thus, the                                                 11  It is important to emphasize here, as we do in our annual capital reviews of large banking organizations, that our supervisory stress testing of all covered firms simultaneously does not supplant the need for firms to develop, and make capital decisions dependent upon, their own stress scenarios that incorporate risks more specific to the activities and portfolios of each firm. That is, the necessary emphasis on macroprudential measures at the present time does not obviate the need for solid microprudentially inspired measures. 12  For a full explanation of the Board’s approach to scenario design, see “Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing (PDF),” Regulation YY – Enhanced Prudential Standards, 12 C.F.R. pt. 252 (2012). See also Nellie Liang (2013), “Implementing Macroprudential Policies (PDF),” speech delivered at the Conference on Financial Stability Analysis: Using the Tools, Finding the Data, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Office of Financial Research, May 31. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  scenario’s unemployment rate would feature a larger and sharper rise in the unemployment rate as economic expansions proceed. Finally, stress tests must be modified so as to avoid incentivizing firms to correlate their asset holdings or adopt correlated hedging strategies. This potential problem can be illustrated by reference to the market shocks we have applied to the trading books of the six largest financial firms in the last two stress tests. The shocks, designed to be severe, consisted of instantaneous, hypothetical jumps in asset prices based on those observed over the entire second half of 2008. The resulting trading losses are – as one would expect – quite large. Even so, had we simply used the same shocks that we used in the 2009 exercise, unchanged from the historical experience, we would have underestimated the potential losses associated with subsequent developments. For that reason, we modified the market shock scenario in 2011 to take account of Eurozone stress and then further modified the hypothesized stress in 2012 to include sharp moves in interest rates. We will continue to modify the market shock regularly to incorporate salient risks that were not necessarily present in 2008 and to ensure that firms cannot artificially improve their performance on the test through holding significant amounts of certain assets that happened to perform well in that period. The second kind of macroprudential resiliency measure reduces the chances of distress or failure for financial companies of systemic importance to a greater degree than for other firms. Key provisions of Dodd-Frank aim at this form of resiliency. One extends the perimeter of regulation by authorizing the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to subject nonbank financial companies to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve if the council “determines that material financial distress” at such a company, or its nature, size, or other characteristics or activities “could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.”13 Another requires the Federal Reserve to establish a broad set of enhanced prudential standards, both for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and for nonbank financial companies designated by the FSOC as systemically important, “[i]n order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States.”14 The required standards include capital requirements, liquidity requirements, stress testing, single-counterparty credit limits, an early remediation regime, and risk-management and resolution-planning requirements. These requirements are to increase in stringency in accordance with the relative systemic importance of the companies. The capital surcharges that we will apply under this authority provide a clear example of this kind of macroprudentially motivated regulation. A microprudential requirement is informed by asking what level of capital would be necessary to allow the firm to remain a viable financial intermediary even after absorbing losses that, within a fairly high level of confidence, might be encountered over some relevant timeframe. A macroprudential capital requirement should take account of the fact that there would be very large negative externalities associated with the disorderly failure of any systemically important financial institution (SIFI), distinct from the costs incurred by the firm, its stakeholders, and the federal deposit insurance fund. As already suggested, the failure of such a firm, especially in a period of stress, significantly increases the chances that other financial firms will themselves experience great stress, for two reasons. First, direct counterparty impacts can lead to a classic domino effect. Second, because losses in a tail event are much more likely to be correlated for firms deeply engaged in trading, structured products, and other capital market instruments, all such firms are vulnerable to accelerating losses as troubled firms sell their assets into a declining market. Enhanced capital requirements should take into account these costs. Thus, the aim of                                                 13  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  financial stability capital standards is to reduce further the probability that the firm might fail under stress through a requirement to hold additional capital. These additional capital requirements can also help offset any funding advantage derived from the perceived status of such institutions as too-big-to-fail. In acting on this rationale for capital standards to mitigate risks to financial stability, we first sought to ensure that there would be an international initiative to develop financial stability capital standards for global systemically important financial institutions. The Basel Committee, an international body of supervisors that includes the U. S. banking agencies, took up this agenda and developed a framework covering more than two dozen large financial firms from around the world. Later this year, we will issue under the authority granted by Dodd-Frank a proposed set of capital surcharges congruent with that framework. The task of determining how much additional capital is needed to reduce the probability of a systemically important firm’s failure to more acceptable levels is not a straightforward one. In calibrating the surcharge, the Basel Committee, with a good bit of input from the Federal Reserve, began with what has been termed the “expected impact” approach, which calls for additional capital to reduce the probability of the firm’s failure sufficiently to equalize the expected impact on the financial system of the failure of a systemically important firm and the failure of a banking firm just outside systemic status.15 But implementing this concept is complicated by the fact that, despite some very useful metrics that have been developed in the past few years for measuring the systemic risk associated with a particular firm, there is certainly no generally accepted approach.16 Indeed, differences among reasonable assumptions in applying the expected impact approach led to a fairly broad range of potential surcharges. The 1 to 2–1/2 percent amounts negotiated within the Basel Committee are at the low end of that range, reflecting a good deal of caution – frankly, more caution than I think would have been desirable, even given the uncertainties. Regardless of one’s views on calibration, though, the motivation and methodology for what have become known as “SIFI surcharges” are clearly macroprudential. One last point on macroprudential resiliency measures is that they can have secondary effects that serve the lean-against-the-wind aim of macroprudential policies. For example, a supervisory stress test can assign a higher loss rate to a certain class of assets in a hypothesized adverse scenario because they are particularly vulnerable to potential shocks and thus susceptible to particularly sharp declines in a serious recession. To the extent that firms learn over time that such assets will be treated that way, there is at least a mild disincentive to hold them. As I will discuss in a moment with respect to countercyclical capital requirements, we should not overstate this lean-against-the-wind effect, but perhaps not dismiss it out of hand either.                                                 15  For example, if the loss to the financial system from the failure of a systemically important firm would be five times that resulting from failure of the non-systemic firm, then the firm would have to hold additional capital sufficient to make the expected probability of failure one-fifth that of the non-systemic institution. 16  Among the useful efforts along these lines are a measure of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) (see Tobias Adrian and Markus K. Brunnermeier (2011), “CoVaR (PDF),” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports 348 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, September), and a measure of systemic risk based on each firm’s contribution to the expected capital shortfall of the entire financial system in a crisis (see Christian T. Brownlees and Robert F. Engle (2011), “Volatility, Correlation and Tails for Systemic Risk Measurement,” New York University Working Paper (New York: New York University, June). The concept behind the latter measure is also described in Viral V. Acharya, Christian Brownlees, Farhang Farazmand, and Matthew Richardson (2011), “Measuring Systemic Risk,” in Regulating Wall Street: The Dodd-Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global Finance (New York: Wiley Publishers), pp. 87–119. Updated systemic risk rankings are maintained by the authors here. A helpful review of the efforts to measure systemic risk is Monica Billio, Mila Getmansky, Andrew W. Lo, and Loriana Pelizzon (2010), “Measuring Systemic Risk in the Finance and Insurance Sectors (PDF),” MIT Sloan School Working Paper 4774–10 (Cambridge, MA: MIT Sloan School of Management, March). 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3. Time-Varying Measures Will Play a More Limited Role. Some discussions of macroprudential policy appear to contemplate a somewhat regular adjustment – up and down – of both resiliency and lean-against-the-wind measures. The idea is to proceed in an intentionally countercyclical fashion by attempting to restrain rapid, unsustainable increases in credit extension or asset prices and to relax those restraints as economic conditions deteriorate. This is a conceptually appealing approach, but, as various commentators on macroprudential policy options have noted, one that raises a fair number of significant issues: the reliability of measures of excess or systemic risk, the appropriate officials to be making macroprudential decisions, the speed with which measures might realistically be implemented and take effect, and the right calibration of measures that will be effective in damping excesses while not unnecessarily reducing well-underwritten credit flows in the economy. If the measures are designed to be targeted, questions of efficacy may be raised by those who believe that suppression of excess credit or asset price increases in one sector will likely result only in the redirection of credit and speculation to other sectors until underlying macroeconomic and financial conditions have ceased enabling such activities. If, on the other hand, the measures are designed to be fairly broad-based, the more basic question of the appropriate role of monetary policy may be raised by those who are focused on reactive policies that “get in all the cracks” of the financial system, not just the heavily regulated portion occupied by large financial firms. Finally, we should probably be skeptical as to how effective a macroprudential relaxation of regulatory requirements can be on the downside of economic cycles. Market discipline, which may have been lax in boom years, tends to become very strict when conditions deteriorate rapidly. Even if supervisors were to announce a relaxation in regulatory requirements, in stressed economic conditions, investors and counterparties may well look unfavorably on reductions in capital levels (even from higher levels) or relaxation of underwriting standards at any one firm, notwithstanding the potential benefits for the economy as a whole were all large firms to follow suit. Anticipating such a reaction, senior management of banks may thus have strong non-regulatory incentives to act as if microprudential regulation continued to dominate. In short, the task of buffering the financial system against a tail event seems more tractable than that of moderating the financial cycle. But these questions of economic knowledge and institutional capacities should be grounds for proceeding cautiously, not for eschewing time-varying measures entirely. It is true that the state of the art of financial stability risk assessment is still in a relatively early stage. But it is reasonable to think that the amount of effort being put into these efforts in governments, central banks, international organizations, and universities will produce some well-conceived and well-tested metrics over time. Some deviations from historical patterns are, even under existing states of knowledge, surely clear enough to justify some action. Moreover, in the absence of time-varying macroprudential tools, the burden of systemic risk containment will rest entirely elsewhere. For time invariant measures to bear this burden, it might be necessary to have through-the-cycle constraints that strengthen financial stability at greater cost to economic activity. If a central bank is reluctant ever to use monetary policy in pursuit of financial stability goals at the expense of more immediate employment and price stability goals, the burden on time invariant measures would be large indeed. Even if financial stability objectives are effectively incorporated into monetary policy, monetary tightening will surely not be the correct response to most instances of increasing leverage or asset prices that raise macroprudential concerns. Well-developed time-varying measures might be effective in slowing the increase in systemic risk to give monetary policymakers more time to evaluate the need for a monetary policy response. There are two obvious places to begin a considered development of time-varying tools. One is in the traditional supervisory oversight of practices at regulated institutions, as enhanced 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  by the increasingly horizontal, interdisciplinary features of large bank supervision. Good supervision is always time-varying, in that it should respond to potential and growing problems in a directed fashion.17 The coordination engendered by the LISCC and parallel efforts facilitates the identification of potentially risky trends in, for example, underwriting certain forms of lending. The greater use of data, both for the regulated sector as collected by supervisors and for the economy as a whole as analyzed by our Office of Financial Stability, further increases the prospects of timely supervisory responses. I do not want to overstate the significance of this evolution in supervisory practice, however. For one thing, as was shown by the experience with commercial real estate lending guidance issued before the crisis, supervisory guidance is an imperfect tool. In addition to the issues surrounding real-time interventions mentioned earlier, that episode revealed the potential for substantial political resistance to supervisory actions directed at specific sectors. Still, with the institutionalization of financial stability concerns at the Federal Reserve and the FSOC, and with the ongoing improvements in relevant analytic capacities, there is room to develop this tool further. The second place to work on time-varying tools is found in another element of the new capital regime, the countercyclical buffer provision of Basel III. This provision envisions an increase in the applicable risk-weighted capital requirements of financial companies by up to 2–1/2 percentage points when “credit growth is excessive and is leading to the buildup of system-wide risk.”18 While stress testing has a built-in degree of time-variance (since macroeconomic scenarios must be constructed annually), the countercyclical buffer is intended to be purely time variant, in that it is to be activated when, and only when, there is “excess aggregated credit growth,” a condition that the Basel Committee anticipates will occur only infrequently.19  The principal macroprudential rationale of the countercyclical buffer is one of increasing resiliency: that the banking system as a whole will have enough capital to continue effective intermediation, even if a period of stress follows what turned out to be a period of unsustainable, rapid credit growth that leads to unusually high losses as asset prices plummet thereafter.20 The Basel Committee also noted that there could be a secondary, lean-against-the-wind effect if the higher capital requirements raise the cost of, and thus dampen, credit extension.                                                 17  One should note that “time-varying” supervision should not mean excessively procyclical supervision. 18  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011), “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems (PDF),” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, June), p. 57. Basel II introduced the concept of a capital “buffer” to supplement the long-established concept of minimum capital requirements. In brief, the idea is that a bank’s distribution of capital to shareholders or employees will be progressively more restricted as capital levels fall below required buffers, but – unlike the case where capital levels fall below minimum requirements – a bank need not bring its capital levels above the buffer by shedding assets or raising new capital. Basel III introduced a “fixed” capital buffer of 2–1/2 percent of common equity on top of the 4–1/2 percent minimum capital requirement. The countercyclical capital buffer would be placed on top of the fixed buffer. If applied at its maximum 2–1/2 percent amount, the countercyclical buffer would thus require that a bank maintain equity capital of at least 9–1/2 percent of risk-weighted assets in order to remain unencumbered by restrictions on capital distributions. There is a view held by some that large banks would be under considerable market pressure to maintain their capital levels above the 7 percent total minimum requirement and fixed buffer (as well as the added systemic surcharge for those banks subject to it), even in stressed periods. 19  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011). 20  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010), “Guidance for National Authorities Operating the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (PDF),” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, December), p. 1. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It is probably not surprising that the regulators represented on the Basel Committee have chosen capital requirements as a time-varying macroprudential tool. Capital regulation is central to prudential regulation and, as already noted, is being used in service of macroprudential objectives. Both regulators and financial institutions are accustomed to capital regimes (although the post-crisis changes have altered that regime quite significantly). Still, it is uncertain just how useful this tool will be.21 In addition to some of the limitations affecting use of all time-varying instruments, such as judging when leverage or asset prices have become excessive, it is quite blunt. If “turned on,” it would apply to all large banks in all parts of the country. So it would not be useful to deploy in response to asset bubbles or leverage in particular sectors, since the additional capital required for lending in those sectors would be no greater than in less frothy parts of the economy. Indeed, it could in some circumstances have the unintended effect of encouraging banks to do more lending in the booming areas of concern, at the expense of lending in more stable areas. The precise impact on bank lending behavior is further muddied by the one-year period given to build the additional capital cushion. These potential shortcomings notwithstanding, the tool is available in the United States to the three federal bank regulatory agencies. It could, in fact, serve as a complement to the more targeted actions available through the supervisory process. The banking agencies included the countercyclical capital provision in the capital regulation to implement Basel III adopted this summer. However, because it will not take effect in the United States until 2016 and because other regulatory and supervisory tasks created by Dodd-Frank and other initiatives need to be completed more quickly, we have not yet built out this tool through policy statements or other institutional steps. Fortunately, when we do turn to the countercyclical capital buffer, we should have the benefit of a good deal of thinking and experience by the Bank of England. The setting of countercyclical capital buffers is now committed to the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) under the reorganization of regulatory functions effected in the United Kingdom on April 1, 2013. The FPC is required to set forth a general statement of its policy and to make quarterly determinations of whether to impose or change a countercyclical buffer.22 I should note, however, that Parliament extended the countercyclical power beyond the broad measure in Basel III and also granted the FPC authority to direct increases in the risk-weights applicable to specific sectors judged to pose a risk to the financial system. While bank regulators in the United States certainly have similar authority as part of our broad power to set capital requirements, we have not to date considered, much less adopted, any regulation along these lines. 4. High Priority to Developing Measures to Control the Structural Vulnerability Presented by Short-Term Wholesale Funding. The shared vulnerabilities of large banking organizations as a whole are underscored by something omitted from Sir Andrew’s otherwise prescient speech: the potential for damaging fire sales, itself exacerbated by the prevalence of short-term funding. The use of short-term wholesale funding was hardly unknown among major financial firms in the 1990s, but broadened significantly thereafter, both within large firms and in sponsored entities such as the now infamous Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) used to fund asset-backed securities. This trend was a dramatic example of the ways in which                                                 21  For a useful discussion of the pros and cons of variants on countercyclical capital buffers, see Douglas J. Elliott (2011), “An Overview of Macroprudential Policy and Countercyclical Capital Requirements,” (Washington: The Brookings Institution, March 10). 22  A draft policy statement was published even before the April 1, 2013, effective date of the new FPC authority. See Bank of England (2013), “The Financial Policy Committee’s powers to supplement capital requirements (PDF),” (London, U.K.: Bank of England, January). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  traditional lending and capital market activities had become increasingly integrated and another example of how prudential regulation had not quickly enough adjusted to that trend. Earlier this week, as we reached the five-year anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ failure, numerous retrospectives on the crisis reminded us of its multiple causes. But the practice of many firms, including all those with sizeable broker-dealers, of funding large amounts of assets with short-term wholesale funding was an accelerant of all the problems that had grown within the financial system. When questions arose about the quality of some of the assets on which short-term funding had been provided, investors who had regarded short-term secured lending as essentially risk-free suddenly became unwilling to lend against a wide range of assets. Then ensued the classic adverse feedback loop, as liquidity-strained institutions found themselves forced to sell positions, which placed additional downward pressure on asset prices, thereby accelerating margin calls on leveraged actors and amplifying mark-to-market losses for all holders of the assets. Although the amounts of short-term wholesale funding have come down from their pre-crisis peaks,23 this structural vulnerability remains, particularly in funding channels that can be grouped under the heading of securities financing transactions (SFTs).24 The use of such funding surely has the potential to increase again during periods of rapid asset appreciation and ready access to leverage. While SFTs are an important and useful part of securities markets, without effective regulation they can create a large run risk, and thus can increase systemic problems that may develop in various asset and lending markets. The risks associated with short-term funding are as much or more macroprudential as they are firm-specific. From a microprudential perspective, SFTs are low risk, because the borrowing is short-dated, overcollateralized, marked-to-market daily, and subject to remargining requirements. Capital charges are low because credit risk is low. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), recently adopted by the Basel Committee and soon to be implemented in the United States through a proposed rulemaking, is an important step forward for financial regulation, since it will be the first broadly applicable quantitative liquidity requirement for banking firms. But it, too, has a principally microprudential focus, since it rests on the implicit premise that maturity-matched books at individual firms present relatively low risks. While maturity mismatch by core intermediaries is a key financial stability risk in wholesale funding markets, it is not the only one. Even if an intermediary’s book of securities’ financing transactions is perfectly matched, a reduction in the intermediary’s access to funding can force the firm to engage in asset fire sales or to abruptly withdraw credit from customers. The intermediary’s customers are likely to be highly leveraged and maturity-transforming financial firms as well, and, therefore, may then have to engage in fire sales themselves. The direct and indirect contagion risks are high. The dangers thus arise in the tail and apply to the entire financial market when normally safe, short-term lending contracts dramatically in the face of sudden and significant uncertainty about asset values and the condition of counterparties. A macroprudential regulatory                                                 23  In 2006, just before the onset of the stresses that eventually led to the financial crisis, the largest U.S. financial firms relied on short-term wholesale funding for about half their total funding needs, and deposits for just over one-third. Today (or, more precisely, as of the end of the second quarter of this year) those proportions are almost exactly reversed. Some of the change is likely due to changes in risk assessment and supervisory expectations.But it is also true that deposits were a safe haven for many households and non-household investors during the crisis. It may be that, as financial and economic conditions continue to normalize, households and other investors will move more deposits into other investment vehicles. 24  Included in this grouping are repo, reverse repo, securities lending and borrowing, and securities margin lending. 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  measure should force some internalization by market actors of the systemic costs of this intermediation. As I have argued elsewhere, one or more such measures should be the highest priority in filling out reform agendas directed both at the largest institutions and at systemic risk more generally.25  One reason I place a high priority on initiatives to address the vulnerability created by short-term wholesale funding is that the development of these and other structural measures does not depend so heavily on identifying when credit growth or asset prices in one or more sectors of the economy have become unsustainable. Instead, an externality analysis can help identify the points of vulnerability and guide the fashioning of appropriate regulations. Indeed, what I described as structural policies may be better suited to containing certain kinds of risks than would policies requiring regular adjustment. Obviously, judgment will still be needed to determine the degree of constraint to be imposed on relevant activities of large banking organizations. But unlike real-time measures – where time will presumably be of the essence if those measures are to be effective – the adoption of structural constraints can proceed with the full opportunity for debate and public notice-and-comment that attends the rulemaking process. 5. Migration of Financial Activities Outside the Regulatory Perimeter Must be Closely Monitored. Whenever increased regulation of similar activities applies only to some firms, incentives increase for the unregulated actors to step up their engagement in those activities. The very considerable strengthening of capital, liquidity, and other regulations in the wake of the financial crisis has presumably created commensurately significant opportunities for just such a shift of activities toward firms not subject to prudential regulation. As more macroprudential regulations applicable to large financial firms come into effect, one can expect that market actors will be exploring possibilities for regulatory arbitrage. In the short term, the potential for migration outside the perimeter of regulated firms may be somewhat limited, precisely because of the dominance of large commercial banks in certain lending markets, of large broker-dealers in intermediation in securities markets, and the absence of ready alternatives to the major clearing and custody banks. But, if the arbitrage gains promise to be high enough, over time, unregulated market actors may find ways to, for example, deal directly with one another in some forms of securities financing. New kinds of firms, perhaps acting solely as agents, might be formed to facilitate these direct transactions between unregulated firms. It is for this reason that the Federal Reserve and our counterparts in other member countries of the Financial Stability Board have been evaluating ideas for market-wide measures even as we move forward with steps directed principally at prudentially regulated firms. Interest in broader, if not universal, regulatory charges on securities financing transactions has developed in recognition of the systemic risks that may develop if, for instance, only certain prudentially regulated firms must incorporate such a charge into their borrowing or lending activities. As we make more progress in reorienting the regulation of large financial firms toward more macroprudential objectives, we will need to watch carefully for such leakage of financial transactions. This concern returns us to the larger project of macroprudential regulation, which implicates a more complicated set of issues around legal authorities and institutional capacities for prudential regulation of markets, as well as firms. But it would be preferable to confront these issues now, before too much of this migration has occurred, than to wait until the problem manifests itself in growing systemic risk.                                                 25  Daniel K. Tarullo (2013), “Evaluating Progress in Regulatory Reforms to Promote Financial Stability,” speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., May 3. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 13  Conclusion The five propositions I have laid out this afternoon are generally intended to outline the contours of a macroprudential approach to the regulation and supervision of large financial institutions, not to identify or elaborate specific policies. But I will close by saying that specific policies to counteract the structural vulnerabilities created by short-term wholesale funding are a priority, not just for the stability of our large prudentially regulated institutions, but for the financial system as a whole. A macroprudential reorientation of our bank regulatory policies will require a range of continuing work on resiliency, on other structural measures, and on the effective blending of macroprudential with traditional microprudential regulatory and supervisory policies. But, even as we make more progress in these areas, our efforts will not be complete without measures addressing what I have termed an accelerant of systemic problems. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Loi M Bakani: Financial inclusion and financial literacy in Papua New Guinea Welcome address by Mr Loi M Bakani, Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, at the National Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy Development Workshop, Port Moresby, 22 August 2013. *      *      * Honorable Don P Polye, MP, Minister of Treasury UN Resident Coordinator, Our colleagues representing key Department ad Ministries, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome. I would also like to extend a special welcome to the Pacific Financial Inclusion Program, our partner in conducting this workshop. I offer in advance my thanks to our Session Chairs and Panelists in the topic discussions later today and tomorrow for the wealth of insight they will impart into our deliberations. My deepest gratitude also to those who have travelled from the provinces and from abroad to take part in our first national strategy for financial inclusion and financial literacy workshop. Papua New Guinea has been at the forefront of innovations and commitments aimed at building an inclusive financial system, because we recognize its role in enhancing sustainable economic growth and development. The National Informal Economy Policy’s included Financial Inclusion as one of its two main pillars for 2011–2015. And earlier this year, the National Executive Council endorsed the Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI). Whether it is creating new technologies or drawing on technologies already widely available such as mobile phones – our banks and private sector actors have led efforts to move beyond cash and make electronic transfers possible for more people in more places – including most critically to the poor and those otherwise unable to access financial services. Donors and our civil society also play a vital role in making innovations work – including to reach poor and vulnerable groups. Their work helps to close capacity gaps & expand the opportunities available to poor people. It also important that our government and public leaders strike the right balance btw incentivizing innovation while ensuring new initiatives are fair, inclusive, and sustainable. To this end Bank of PNG continues to put in place appropriate regulations, safeguards and adequate infrastructure. However, financial exclusion remains astoundingly high and is most severe among women and rural and informal workers. Today’s national workshop on financial inclusion and financial literacy is about coming together to recognize those challenges that stand in our way. We must commit ourselves to overcoming them in a coordinated and collaborative way. Because we cannot solve them as one institution or one individual. The workshop will start with setting the parameters for what is means to build an inclusive financial sector, after which we will together review the state of financial inclusion in the country. I must say that I am encouraged that we are seeing double digit growth in financial services access points across the country, including a 200% annual growth in agents since 2008. There is now a wider range of financial products being offered by both existing and new service providers, including micro-insurance. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  We will also hear from financial service providers on how they have identified and segmented their markets, and share with us what has worked and what needs improving. Real partners that not only provide the system, but also can create the demand for it, are essential to bring down transaction costs for everyone, and especially the poor. Participating financial service providers and other experts will identify what regulatory and market conditions are necessary to encourage innovation and scale. We will share the findings of the BPNG/PFIP Financial Competency survey 2013. As you all know, financial literacy can enhance the ability of people to interface more effectively with the financial system. It can help them manage risks in their day-to-day lives and plan for the future. And, it can play an important role in promoting savings and household asset accumulation. These are important benefits not only for individuals but also at the national level. At the workshop, we will hear from financial literacy providers on successful approaches which have improved the financial behaviours of people with low levels of functional as well as financial literacy. Improved financial literacy can increase economic participation and social inclusion, drive competition and market efficiency in the financial services sector. In particular, the National Workshop will come up with concrete and measurable actions to overcome the key constraints excluding women. Women constitute approximately 50% of the country’s 7 million people but disproportionally represent less than 30% of total financial services portfolio in the country. On 20 August, we gathered together 25 leaders from across the country, and with help with Women World Banking, will present the main recommendations to you today. The Bank has, through our participation in the Pacific Island Working Group, reviewed our regulatory environment for consumer protection, the findings of which we will share with you today. I consider it integral to integrate consumer protection and consumer empowerment as a key pillar of financial inclusion and will invite practical suggestions on strengthening consumer protection and market conduct. On the second day of this workshop, all participants will be assigned to specific Working Groups to deliberate on key topics and reach consensus on 3 priority actions each to be accomplished from 2014 to 2015. Each group will present their priority actions with measurable targets, including delineating responsibilities and resources required to achieve them. Your role here today is of critical importance and I encourage you to discuss freely today’s topics with the other participants, and to find innovative solutions to progress financial inclusion and financial literacy for all Papua New Guineans. To deliver more effectively & expand access to financial services – we need the innovation and reach of the private sector – the local know-how of community groups, as well as the leadership and initiative of governments. The road to building an inclusive financial system is long but our partnership; our collective effort will unlock many opportunities to extend our reach for that goal. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benny Popoitai: Commitment to Total Quality Assurance Address by Mr Benny Popoitai, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, at the Divine Word University 2013 Open Day, Port Moresby, 5 May 2013. *      *      * Fr. Jan Czuba, President of the Divine Word University (DWU), DWU Community (administration, staff and students), DWU Development Partners, invited guests, ladies and gentlemen. Good evening to you all. It is indeed an honour to be invited to make the Key Note Speech at your 2013 Open Day celebration and activities. The theme of your 2013 Open Day is “Commitment to Total Quality Assurance”. I note that this theme is consistent with DWU’s mission and core values that strives for academic excellence and quality academic programs. It is a theme that is not only appropriate but very relevant given the stage we are in with our nation’s development and the many challenges we face in nation-building. Equipping our young people not only with the required academic qualifications but the necessary and important societal values of living and working together harmoniously before they enter the workforce and mainstream society is very important. I therefore at the outset must thank the DWU for its commitment, drive and vigour in striving for total quality assurance in preparing the next generation of workers and leaders of our country. If you google Total Quality Assurance or TQA, you will get about 29.2 million entries or results on the internet. The results throw up other related terminologies like Total Quality Management (TQM) and Total Quality Control (TQC). Why so many results? It is because TQA, TQM and TQC are not only hot topics in management and performance benchmarking but also vital in driving excellence and ensuring competitiveness in the fiercely competitive workplace we face today, whatever the industry or service you may refer to. TQA in short, as many of you would be aware, relates to ensuring a product or output meets required or expected standards in a suitable delivery time. Education, as we all know, is at the heart of every nation’s strives to develop. Providing access, opportunities and quality education is therefore very important for the prospects of our young nation. Our educational institutions should not only aim at turning out quantities of students but more importantly, a high quality of graduates. This is where DWU fits in well with the engagement of the Australian Universities Quality Agency in 2011 to conduct an independent External Academic Audit of your activities and programmes. I was humbled to learn that DWU was the first university in the country to voluntarily go through the independent External Academic Audit in recognition of education as a public good, the many challenges faced in PNG and the need to demonstrate a system of accountability and learning culture for our education institutions. Such initiatives aimed at improving academic performance and status are very worthwhile investment and truly reflect the genuineness of the DWU Council, Academic Board and Development Partners. If the audit recommendations are implemented successfully, which I am sure they will through your 10 year Action Plan, this will mean quality programs/courses offered which will further increase stakeholders and general public confidence for the DWU in producing quality graduates to assist in the delivery of social, economic, cultural and political development of our country. DWU’s drive towards TQA is highly commendable. One has only to read the daily newspapers, listen to the radio or watch the television to see the serious problems we have in our society today – some worth mentioning are corruption, crime, unemployment, poor socio-economic indicators and social disharmony. We have generated high economic growth for over a decade now but still struggle to ensure we all live together in peace and happiness. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The efforts by DWU is consistent and complements the Government’s 2050 Vision Strategic Plan which sets out Human Capital Development as one of its priority pillars, in fact at the top of the list. An article in the Post Courier on 29 April 2013 (this week Monday) reported the Government’s focus on higher education, with funding between K40m and K50m on higher education reforms over the next five years to meet global quality standards. There will be amendments to the Office of Higher Education (OHE) Act to make OHE the regulator to oversee the operations of the universities and higher learning institutions. I am pleased to note that the initiatives taken by the DWU will place it well ahead of its peers and the reforms about to take place in the higher education system of our country. We at the Bank are also constantly looking at ways to up skill our human resources and improve our work processes and engaging professionals and independent persons/firms to review our work process as part of the ongoing quality assurance program. Institutions and firms that have quality assurance program built into their work processes will no doubt benefit from the investment and stay ahead of the pack. Regarding initiatives from the Bank, we are looking at sponsoring programs at the universities such as the Banking and Finance courses already taught at the University of PNG. We are also embarking on financial inclusion programs and are talking with the Education Department to develop curriculums to be taught in our primary and secondary schools. In addition, the Bank has an ongoing graduate development program and we will be coming over to DWU in the coming years to continue to sponsor top students in Business Studies programs. The Bank to date has sponsored a number of DWU students who are currently working with us. The Bank has also engaged DWU services through Fr. Jan Czuba to conducted training on Ethnical Leadership in Business where all Bank executive and management team including myself attended in March 2013. This is a simple testament of the confidence the Bank has in your students, academic staff and your efforts to offer quality research, teaching, learning and community engagement and will further strengthen the relationship. I have the opportunity today to be shown around the school and have witnessed firsthand the upgraded educational facilities. I am overwhelmed by the effort and the commitment of the University Council, Academic Board and Development Partners into ensuring quality education is offered. I am sure you will all agree with me that the University has come a long way in the last few years. On your Open Day celebrations, I had the opportunity to visit the many stalls and display exhibitions put out by the various DWU faculties. If I were a judge, I know I will have a tough time deciding on who is the winner because they all, to me, met TQA standards and are all winners. In the next couple of minutes we will witness awards for the faculty displays held today. May the best team win and I wish you all an enjoyable evening for the rest of the program. Thank you all. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jwala Rambarran: Consolidated supervision, risk-based supervision and market discipline Opening remarks by Mr Jwala Rambarran, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at the Basel II Implementation Workshop, organised by the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC), Port of Spain, 17–20 September 2013. *      *      * Good morning  First, I wish to thank CARTAC for arranging this Basel II Implementation Workshop and for inviting me to give some brief opening remarks this morning.  As we all know, safe and robust banks operating in a well regulated financial system play a key role in the economy and society. One of the main lessons of the recent global financial crisis is that banks must improve their ability to manage risk, so they do not inflict serious damage on the economy. This calls for a stronger risk management culture within banks. This calls for stronger regulation and supervision within central banks and other regulatory agencies.  In today’s discourse, most commentators assume that “strengthening regulation” is simply a matter of implementing international standards, of which the most important is the Basel Capital Accord, designed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Other commentators, however, have examined alternative approaches to prudential regulation beyond standards. They argue that a strategy for prudential policy must address three main weaknesses: the impossibility of fine-tuning bank safety margins in the uncharted territory that is banking in the developing world; the need to provide insulation against the large shocks to which these economies are prone; and the lack of enforcement that results from the concentration of political power in many such countries.  This year marks the 25th anniversary of the 1998 Basel Capital Accord, which through its two incarnations has emerged as the international gold standard for banks‟ capital requirements. The first manifestation came in June 2004 when the Basel Committee wholly rewrote the original Basel Accord, which has a number of flaws. For instance, it is risk insensitive, it does not differentiate between credit risk and other risks a bank typically faces, and it can easily be circumvented by regulatory arbitrage. The new Accord, generally known as Basel 2, represented a fundamental change of approach to regulation. The revised framework is highly complex and makes its understanding and implementation a great challenge, not only to regulators but also to the regulated community. Basel 2, for example, assumes that discipline by the markets and by supervisors is beneficial. Yet, as we have seen particularly, over the last five years, both markets and governments can, and do, fail.  The second incarnation of the original Basel Accord has seen most G-20 countries starting to implement the Basel 3 capital rules, which has delivered what many consider to be the world’s first global liquidity standard for banks. The jury is still out on Basel 3.  As many of you know (or at least I hope you know), the Basel Committee does not have the right to impose the standards it produces on others, and has never, at least explicitly, sought to constrain national authorities to do so. Nevertheless, more than 100 countries are implementing the three versions of the Basel Accord in different forms at varying speeds.  Here in the Caribbean, most jurisdictions are still seeking to fully comply with Basel 1 before moving to Basel 2, while others are focusing on first satisfying Pillar 2 of the Basel 2 Framework. The region, as whole, decided to put the adoption of Basel 2 on hold following criticisms of the approach in the wake of the eruption of the international financial crisis in 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches mid-2007. Five years later, one might even perhaps question why the region is not focusing on Basel 3 at this time.  So why has the Caribbean region been grappling with implementation of the Basel Accord. Perhaps the answer, in my respectful view, is that Basel framework was never really designed with developing countries in mind, and implementation of any version in developing countries is likely to be fraught with difficulties.  There are a number of factors which determine the speed of Basel Accord implementation plans in different countries of the world. These include the size, structure and degree of financial sector development, the level of economic development, and the capacity of the existing regulatory and supervisory authorities. Application of these factors to the Caribbean reveals the following:  First, the small island states in the Caribbean experience greater macroeconomic volatility, and greater volatility of external flows and greater vulnerability to external shocks than the industrial countries. Secondly, the newer versions of the Basel framework rely on strong institutions. In the Caribbean, institutions limiting rent-seeking are weak: banker and bureaucrat have more opportunity and incentive to reap private benefits at public cost. Basel 3, for example, presumes that sophisticated and integrated risk management systems are in place, and for the Caribbean this is generally not the case. And thirdly, skills are scarce in the Caribbean. Supervision and market discipline require skilled supervisors and market participants.  I, therefore, believe it is timely for the regional Working Committee on Basel 2 implementation to start thinking about developing a regional prudential road map that is more appropriately tailored to our circumstances. Such a road map should take at least three concerns into account. These are as follows:  1.  Pay more attention to the stability of the financial system, not only risk of the constituent parts. Remember, two banks with the same failure probability but different size present the same risk to their depositors but different risks to the system. Macro-prudential data is most likely to give better warning to policymakers of a build-up of financial imbalances.  2.  Take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going. We have learned the hard way that when the music is playing, bankers want to dance. One way to restrain the excesses of booms is to impose countercyclical prudential requirements to lessen the procyclical nature of the Basel 2 framework for credit risk. These countercyclical prudential requirements include minimum capital ratios, collateral haircuts, liquidity and currency mismatch limits.  3.  Rely, as much as possible, on simple rules that are easy to write, communicate, enforce and verify. Agreement and implementation of the global regulatory agenda has been gradual. The reform momentum is waning due to lack of agreement on specific issues especially when national political pressures trump a global consensus. These delays are adding to regulatory uncertainty and weigh heavily on the financial sector.  In closing, I want to emphasize that no amount of regulation or intensive supervision will be able to catch poor financial conduct, malfeasance or unlawful activity, all the time. As Mark Carney, current Governor at the Bank of England, once remarked “virtue cannot be regulated.”  I wish you all a productive Workshop. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile: The planned introduction of the East African Monetary Union Remarks by Mr Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the opening of the East African Legislative Assembly Consultative Workshop on the East African Monetary Union, Kampala, 9 September 2013. *      *      * Honourable Ministers and Honourable Members of the East African Legislative Assembly Ladies and Gentlemen The issue that we have gathered here to discuss today – the planned introduction of the East African Monetary Union (EAMU) – is one which will have profound effects on this region for decades to come. Later this year I expect that the heads of state of each of the partner states of the East African Community (EAC) will sign the Protocol for the introduction of the EAMU. The Protocol will pave the way for the transition to EAMU over the course of the next 10 years and the complementary legal, institutional and economic reforms. The East African Monetary Union is a project with potentially large long term benefits for all of the economies in the EAC but which also entails considerable risks. The long term success of EAMU will be dependent upon major changes to public policy and in the way in which public policy is made in all partner states of the EAC. A successful monetary union is only possible if each partner state is prepared to accept the pooling of its economic sovereignty. Many economic decisions which are now made at the national level will have to be made at the regional level. This pooling of economic sovereignty extends beyond the loss of independent national monetary policy and exchange rates, which is of course inherent in a monetary union; it also requires that each partner state accepts constraints on its fiscal policy and implements fully the provisions of the common market, including not just free trade in goods and services within the EAC but also the free movement of capital and labour within the EAC. If we do not build the requisite foundations for monetary union, the introduction of EAMU may actually harm our economies. The problems which are currently being experienced by some of the peripheral members of the Euro zone – Greece, Portugal and Spain for example – which have lost competitiveness on international markets and can no longer use exchange rate depreciation to restore their competitiveness, should provide a salutary lesson to everyone involved in planning for the introduction of the EAMU. Without wishing to pre-empt any of the contributions from my colleagues in the EAC Secretariat, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and the Economic Policy Research Council which we will hear later on in this workshop, I would like to take a few minutes of your time to explain why I believe that monetary union in East Africa will make an important contribution to the long term development of our region, potentially helping to accelerate the transition of our economies to middle income status, and also to identify the critical prerequisites for the successful introduction of EAMU.  Why is monetary union important in East Africa? The partner states of the EAC are implementing a customs union and a common market in order to promote regional economic integration. Deeper regional economic integration will provide a major spur to development in all partner states by strengthening competition within our respective domestic markets, by allowing producers to reap greater economies of scale and thus become more efficient, and by widening opportunities for trade. The regional market will also provide a stepping stone for domestic producers to access global markets. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The primary rationale for the monetary union is to cement the benefits of regional economic integration. Replacing individual currencies with one single common currency will reduce the costs and risks of transacting business across the national boundaries of the partner states of the EAC. Monetary union removes the costs of having to transact in different currencies and the risk of adverse exchange rate movements for trade within East Africa. Furthermore, because the combined economy of all of the partner states together will be more diversified than that of any individual partner state, it will be less vulnerable to external shocks such as commodity price shocks and as a consequence, the volatility of the common exchange rate against that of other major currencies such as the dollar or Euro should be less than the volatility of the currently existing national currencies of the partner states. Exchange rate volatility is a major risk for business and a deterrent to private investment, especially in the traded goods sectors of the economy. Hence by eliminating entirely exchange rate movements within the EAC, and by reducing exchange rate volatility with respect to third party currencies outside of the EAC, the EAMU should reduce some of the commercial risks of doing business in East Africa and, as such, help to promote more private investment. EAMU will also be important for the future of East Africa because of the signal it sends to the rest of the world. Having a common currency is one of the clearest statements of intent that the EAC can make to demonstrate its long term commitment to deep regional integration. It sends a message to foreign investors that the EAC really is a genuine single market in which to do business. Because it involves a major loss of economic sovereignty, the introduction of the EAMU is also a political statement about the commitment of partner states in the EAC to a common future as East Africans, rather than just as citizens of individual nation states. What are the prerequisites for the success of monetary union? The first prerequisite for the EAMU is that all partner states implement the customs union and common market in full. This means removing all non tariff barriers (NTBs) to intra-regional trade in the EAC. It means allowing firms in the services industries, such as transport firms, domiciled in any partner state to sell their services without restriction in all other partner states. It also means accepting without preconditions the free movement of labour throughout the EAC: for example Kenyans should be able to live and work in Uganda without restrictions and without having to pay for work or residency permits. Finally, it means allowing the free movement of capital across borders within the EAC. Free capital mobility within the EAC will only be meaningful if each partner state imposes no restrictions on the purchase of assets by investors from any other partner state. A genuine single market in the EAC, without any restrictions on the movement of goods, services or factors of production, is an essential foundation for EAMU for two reasons. First, the benefits of monetary union to the partner states are positively correlated with the amount of trade between the partner states and the degree of integration of their economies. Unless there is very substantial trade within the EAC, there will be only minor benefits to be derived from a common currency. East Africa will not be able to attain the fullest degree of economic integration which is possible until all of the artificial barriers to intra-regional trade and to the movement of factors of production within the EAC have been abolished. Secondly, the member states of the EAC will inevitably suffer what are called “idiosyncratic economic shocks”; these are shocks which affect the economy of one member state but not those of others. For an economy with its own currency and an independent monetary policy, the optimal response to a macroeconomic shock will usually involve monetary and exchange rate policy; for example, an economy might adjust to a negative terms of trade shock through a depreciation of the real exchange rate to restore external balance. It is self evident that membership of a monetary union means that national authorities cannot use either monetary or exchange rate policy to adjust to an idiosyncratic macroeconomic shock, leaving them more vulnerable to the adverse consequences of such shocks. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  However, regional integration offers an alternative adjustment mechanism for countries experiencing idiosyncratic shocks. For example, suppose the economy of one partner state suffers a major decline in the international price of one of its main exports. Such a shock would reduce the incomes of exporters and thereby cut aggregate demand, causing a recession in the domestic economy if the shock were large enough. In this case, the shock to aggregate demand could be mitigated if domestic producers were able to redirect their output to the markets of their partner states. Hence the initial idiosyncratic shock to one partner state can be absorbed by all partner states within the monetary union, lessening the adverse impact on the partner state which suffered the initial shock. But this mechanism of adjustment will only be possible if there are no barriers to trade across national boundaries within the EAC, so that it is not much more difficult for Ugandan firms to sell their goods or services in Kenya than it is in Uganda itself. Another example is that of the Dutch disease which is often created by the domestic spending generated by a natural resource boom. The adverse impact of Dutch disease can be mitigated through the entry into the resource boom economy of labour and service sector firms from partner states, which can ease supply constraints and thus inflationary pressures in the resource boom economy. The point that I want to emphasize is that, if we introduce a monetary union without first having put in place a genuine common market which can act as a shock absorber for idiosyncratic shocks hitting individual economies, we run the risk of exposing our economies to greater macroeconomic volatility. The second prerequisite for a successful monetary union is sound fiscal policy, as is very clearly demonstrated by the problems currently afflicting some of the Euro zone members, notably Greece. The credibility of the monetary policy of the common central bank of the EAC will depend on it never having to finance the fiscal deficits of partner states. Unfortunately, it is difficult for a common central bank to credibly commit itself never to finance the fiscal deficit of a partner state, because there may be circumstances when providing deficit financing is the least worst option available if the alternative of allowing a sovereign default to occur risks a systemic financial crisis throughout the EAC. This is the dilemma which has faced the European Central Bank since the global financial crisis broke out: a sovereign default in, for example, Italy would not just affect Italians; the damage would be spread throughout the Eurozone because of the contagion to financial institutions in other Euro zone members. To avoid any danger of monetary policy being undermined by having to bail out the Government of a partner state, it is necessary that the public debt of each partner state of the EAMU must be sustainable and also perceived to be sustainable, so that each Government can always fully meet its borrowing requirement from the market without having to resort to finance from the common central bank to avoid a sovereign default. To ensure public debt sustainability institutional mechanisms must be put in place, and enforced, to impose ceilings on fiscal deficits and public debt. The Euro zone had the mechanisms to ensure public debt sustainability in the Stability and Growth Pact, but they were not properly enforced. In the EAC we are formulating fiscal rules to curb fiscal deficits and public borrowing. These targets will be set out in the EAMU Protocol to be signed later this year. It goes without saying that it is imperative that these fiscal rules are complied with at all times. Failure to abide by these fiscal rules could fatally undermine the prospects for a successful monetary union. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Conclusion The introduction of a monetary union is undoubtedly the most challenging project ever undertaken at the regional level in East Africa. The difficulties and risks involved should not be underestimated. The potential long term benefits of monetary union are large. If the monetary union is designed well and implemented properly, it should contribute to faster growth in trade, productivity, jobs and output over several decades. But the benefits will not be realized unless partner states are prepared to undertake the radical reforms necessary to put in place the essential foundations for monetary union, which include the implementation in full of the common market within the EAC and the establishment of rules based sound fiscal policies. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardian Fullani: Improving the performance of Albania’s banking sector Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the year-end event with the Albanian Association of Banks, Tirana, 17 December 2013. *      *      * Dear bank executives, Your Excellency Ambassador Sequi, Dear Mr. Ilahi, Dear Mr. Pencabligil, It is a pleasure for me to participate in this year-end meeting, as we reflect about the challenges we faced and the objectives we accomplished in this year, and endeavour to identify issues that may arise over the next year. Given the celebrations time and the spirit of this meeting, I would rather not dwell upon all the issues I would have liked to. However, I will share with you my opinion on two issues I consider as important for a good performance of the banking sector over 2014. Before moving on, we should acknowledge that the year we are leaving behind was a difficult one for the banking sector. In its development cycle for over more than one decade, this year, the banking sector’s growth slowed down sharply and annual lending levels contracted. Deteriorated asset quality, dictated by credit, has led to lower financial profit due to higher provisions needed. These developments have reflected the overall economic slowdown and domestic demand drop resulting from lower private consumption and investments. However, other developments highlighted the banking sector’s capacity to properly respond to and cope with these challenges. The banking sector has maintained ample liquidity and capital levels thanks to the further rise in public deposits and added capital by parent banks. In terms of non-performing loans, obvious efforts have been made to restructure credit and sell off non-performing loans to non-bank financial institutions. The Albanian Association of Banks has played an active role in discussing the problems with relevant authorities and identifying solutions through the regulatory treatment of non-performing loans, notably, the legal amendments to collateral execution process, which entered into force in September 2013. Through its activity, the banking industry may transform 2014 into a better year for both the banking industry and the Albanian economy. I think that this may be achieved through harder work in the following aspects: The first aspect pertains to restoring lending to adequate levels in Albania. This objective may be achieved by interlinking these three elements: a)  Cleaning up balance sheets from non-performing loans. It is indispensible that you should mark evident progress during 2014 to write off loss loans from their balance sheets and engage in cautious credit restructuring, where necessary. The improvement in the fiscal handling of loan write-offs, in the near future, is expected to better support this process; however, this does not justify the sluggish and protracted action. I, therefore, call for your utmost commitment to successfully implement projects initiated with the World Bank in this regard.  Additionally, quantitative objectives for reducing the level of non-performing loans should be included in your institution’s annual work plans for 2014; b)  Evaluating and selecting new loan applications in a professional fashion. Indeed, credit demand remains weak; however, this exists and must be viewed in terms of its potential for growth in the future. In this regard, the banking industry should 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  strengthen its analysis to steer lending toward those sectors of the economy with high development potentials. Priority should also be given to launching banking products that boost credit demand from small and medium-sized enterprises, mitigating credit risk through portfolio diversification and improving the stable return on bank lending; c)  Reducing lending costs. I refer to the interest rate applied to lek loans. To our opinion, it has inadequately reflected both the key interest rate trend and our expectations. From the decrease in the interest rates applied to government borrowing, we understand that the inert moves in the cost of lending reflect the risk premia the banking industry imposes when lending to the private sector. For 2014, we think that the banking industry should better support the private sector, considering that: • IMF’s agreement with Albania will mitigate government’s need for borrowing; • Public arrears to the private sector are expected to begin to be paid off shortly; • Worsening financial ratios in the banking industry imposes the gradual return to lending to the private sector, in order to improve the generation of income. Second, I would like to underline the need for the significant improvement of technical capacity and structures for risk management. In this regard, your decision making should include analytical assessments of the performance of your institutions against various scenarios. This is a requirement stipulated in the existing regulatory framework, which we will monitor with additional caution over the next year. In our view, this element constitutes a bank management quality indicator. Sparing the details, I would like to emphasize that the Bank of Albania will continue to provide the necessary support for all these processes. We appreciate the professional and direct cooperation with you, as an important element to comply with the requirements of the supervisory and regulatory framework. Moreover, the IMF’s agreement and additional financial support from the World Bank and the European Union will contribute to restoring the country’s long-term economic stability, translating the macroeconomic stability into higher economic growth rates. I am confident the banking industry will use this moment to identify the best opportunities to restructure and improve its performance and expand its activity, thus reassuming its role as the engine for the country’s economic development. Thanking you for the invitation, I would like to wish you all good health and a prosperous and successful New Year! Happy New Year! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Interview with Der Spiegel Interview with Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, and Der Spiegel, published on 30 December 2013. *      *      * SPIEGEL: Mr Draghi, do you know Andrea Nahles? Draghi: I have heard the name before but I don’t know her personally.  SPIEGEL: Ms Nahles is the new German Labour minister and boss of Jörg Asmussen, your former colleague in the Executive Board of the ECB. That he gives up this prestigious job has caused great surprise in Germany. Did you chase him out? Draghi: Jörg and I had an excellent personal and professional relationship. I consider it as a great loss for us that he is returning to the government. Of course we did not agree on every occasion. SPIEGEL: Asmussen is the third German central banker to give up his job prematurely, after Bundesbank boss Axel Weber and the former ECB Executive Board member Jürgen Stark. Why aren’t the Germans happy at the ECB? Draghi: You can’t compare these cases. Jörg has made it clear that it was only family reasons which prompted him to go back to Berlin. I have no reason to doubt that. SPIEGEL: In any case, Weber and Stark resigned because of your policy, which led to your famous remark in London a year and a half ago about doing “everything necessary” to save the euro. That means, in an emergency, buying up the government bonds of the crisis-ridden countries and taking on risks amounting to billions for which in the end German taxpayers above all would be liable. Can you understand that many German citizens are at odds with this? Draghi: Weber and Stark resigned before my arrival at the ECB. But the truth is that conditions in the euro area have improved considerably since then. Consider the latest developments: crisis-ridden countries such as Ireland and Portugal are exiting the bailout programme, the risk premia for loans to crisis-hit countries in southern Europe are declining, and investors from all over the world are once again investing in Europe. In other words, most of the financial-economic data are turning in the right direction. SPIEGEL: Are you saying the euro crisis is over? Draghi: No, but the fears felt by some sectors of the public in Germany have not been confirmed. What haven’t we been accused of? When we offered European banks additional liquidity two years ago, it was said there would be a high rate of inflation. Nothing has happened. When I made my comment in London, there was talk of a violation of the central bank’s mandate. But we had made clear from the beginning that we are moving within our mandate. Each time it was said, for goodness’ sake, this Italian is ruining Germany. There was this perverse Angst that things were turning bad, but the opposite has happened: inflation is low and uncertainty reduced. SPIEGEL: The economic crisis in Europe is still threatening to blow up the euro. Growth is low, so unemployment in southern Europe is reaching record levels. Draghi: The crisis has not been overcome, but there are many encouraging signs. The economy is recovering in many countries, the imbalances in European trade are declining and the budget deficits in the monetary union are falling. That’s more than was expected a year ago. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  SPIEGEL: But the debt level in many euro area countries is rising unabated, and there’s less willingness to reform. Greece, for example, will again miss its targets. Does the country need another bailout? Draghi: In Greece, quite a few things have changed for the better, but the country has to do more, there’s no doubt about that. SPIEGEL: In fact, the situation is disastrous. If the state has to take up emergency loans again, Greece will definitely be living off the rest of the euro area. How is the country ever to get back on its feet? Draghi: Some countries need a programme that runs for three years, others take somewhat longer. In Greece, the position at the outset was particularly difficult, so now we have to be particularly patient with the country. That’s no surprise. SPIEGEL: The reform process is slowing down in other countries as well. France, for example, is again making debts, and the planned reforms in the labour market or the tax system are not moving ahead. How concerned are you about developments in the euro area’s second-largest country? Draghi: France is facing the same problems as other countries which need to get their budgets in order and to make structural reforms. Many states have raised taxes and cut investments first. This is the easiest way, but both approaches weaken growth. A more promising avenue is to bring current government spending down and introduce structural reforms in the labour market. SPIEGEL: The only problem is that France isn’t doing that. Aren’t you getting tired of repeatedly urging the country to reform, but then nothing happens? Draghi: In Latin you say: “Repetita iuvant – to repeat is beneficial”. The fewer changes made in a country, the more often I repeat my messages. And it works. SPIEGEL: We have a feeling that the number of governments which can no longer hear your tune is growing. The new coalition in Germany, for example, wants to undo the pension reforms made by the red-green coalition government years ago and introduce a universal minimum wage of €8.50. Are these policies that help the euro? Draghi: It is too early to assess the policies of the new German government. I can only say that the crisis has shown that the monetary union is incomplete and that the weaknesses need to be remedied. Germany helps the euro best by further strengthening its competitiveness and promoting growth. Whatever helps that process is right, everything else is wrong. SPIEGEL: Many economists represent a completely different theory. They regard Germany’s competitiveness as the real problem of the euro area and are calling for state curbs on exports. What do you think of that? Draghi: Not much. It’s a mechanistic perspective of economic activity, and there’s little I can do with it. We won’t make the weak stronger by making the strong weaker, as a very wise man once said. That applies to the economy as well. If Germany were less competitive, the euro area as a whole would lose, because less could be produced then. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  SPIEGEL: In Germany, ECB policy is unpopular because you have now pushed the interest rates for investments down so far that they are often no longer enough to compensate for inflation. In other words, only fools save.  Draghi: That’s not the fault of the ECB. The link between the short-term interest rates set by the ECB and the long-term interest rates paid on investments which are relevant for savers in Germany is not very strong. SPIEGEL: Really? It’s a stated goal of your policy to indirectly suppress long-term interest rates. Draghi: No, especially in recent years, we were unable to control long-term interest rates – because investors were very unsettled by the euro crisis. That’s why everyone has been taking money into Germany to buy safe German government bonds. That’s why the interest rates in Germany have fallen. We take the concerns of savers very seriously. But how can we respond? We run monetary policy for the entire euro area, not for a single country. If we are able to dispel the uncertainty, many investors will again take their money out of Germany and back to their home countries and interest rates will rise again. SPIEGEL: People can see in the statements from their life insurance companies that they are getting ever smaller payouts from year to year because of the interest rates. The truth is that savers are paying the price for rescuing the euro. Draghi: I am sure that the insurance companies do not refer to the key policy rate when they send their statements. We can only control that rate. Long-term interest rates are determined largely by global financial markets. If the Fed decides to buy US Treasury bonds worth USD 1 trillion a year, then that affects interest rates worldwide. SPIEGEL: The Fed has now announced to reduce the purchases of government bonds. What does that mean for the Euro area and the Euro? Draghi: So far markets have shown that the announcement by the FOMC has not affected the euro area markets. Their resilience is greater than a year ago. SPIEGEL: That does not help the savers much. Currently, you get about 0.8% interest per year on a savings account in Germany, while the inflation rate is 1.3%. Do you think that is a normal and healthy development? Draghi: Normal and healthy it is not. The real interest rate should be positive under normal conditions. Today in some countries it is negative, in others it is positive and even too high. We are very aware of the risks such fragmentation entails. SPIEGEL: Which risks do you mean? Draghi: First, the stability of the financial system is at risk if interest rates are too low for too long. Until now, however, we have only seen significant price increases in some specific and limited markets, for example, in some real estate markets in Europe. The second serious risk is that inflation, which is already clearly below our 2% target, might fall further. Yet we aren’t seeing any deflation, i.e. a general fall in prices. But we must be very careful that we do not permanently fall below 1% inflation and thus into the danger zone. SPIEGEL: How do you intend to react to it – should interest rates fall further? Draghi: At the moment we see no need for immediate action. We don’t have Japanese conditions. There, the expectation of falling prices became entrenched. In the euro area, market participants are convinced that inflation will rise to close but below 2% again. In 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  addition, Japan for a long time did not respond so resolutely in terms of its monetary policy as did the ECB. And finally, banks and companies in Japan were in a worse condition than those in the euro area today. SPIEGEL: The condition of European banks is bad enough. So the banking union is going to come now and create a level playing field for all banks in the euro area. How important is the project for the monetary union? Draghi: Extremely important. Europe’s financial system is still fragmented. Although the gap in funding costs for banks within the euro area is no longer as wide as it was two years ago. But in lending the differences are still very large, and in some countries the credit flow is disrupted. The banking union can help to restore confidence in cross-border lending. The most important objective of the Asset Quality Review is transparency. We want to shed light on what is hidden in the banks’ balance sheets. SPIEGEL: The EU has just agreed on a procedure how to handle banks that are not viable. Does the new resolution mechanism meet your wishes? Draghi: I really want such a mechanism to work. We, as a supervisory body, decide only whether a bank is viable or not. Then the resolution authority has to decide what to do with the bank: close it, split it up or sell it. The problem is, when we say that the bank is not viable, steps then have to be taken extremely quickly. And it is certain that it does not work when hundreds of people across Europe have to discuss what needs to be done. SPIEGEL: But is that certain with the decision taken now? Draghi: If urgent action is needed we’ll have a fast-track procedure that gives the Council and the Commission 24 hours to decide on proposals of the Board of the resolution mechanism. If they don’t decide a bank faces liquidation, so there will be enough pressure to find a solution. SPIEGEL: What condition are European banks in? Draghi: To find that out, we will be closely examining the balance sheets of banks in the coming year. No conclusive judgement can be reached prior to that. But the banking system is now in a much better position than four years ago. Since then, around €0.5 trillion of fresh capital has flowed into the euro area banks and many institutions have changed their business models. What is also certain is that almost all banks have been operating much more profitably and with lower costs. SPIEGEL: You paint a very positive picture of the euro area, but many German policy-makers remain very critical of ECB policy. How much longer can the conflict between you and Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann go on? Draghi: I would rather speak of convergence than of conflict. Our positions have clearly moved closer to each other and cooperation has improved. Take the recent interest rate reduction, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann initially had some reservations, but then he said that this step was justified. I have often said that I have great respect for the Bundesbank as an institution and for what it means to the Germans. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  SPIEGEL: That sounds rather like Christmas harmony. Some economists in Germany speak of the “Club Med” when they talk about the majority of southern Europeans in the Governing Council and accuse you of copying the inflation policy of the Bank of Italy in the 1970s. Draghi: There are only a few who are insinuating that I am helping Italy because I’m Italian. This doesn’t affect me. I have proved often enough that I adhere strictly to the mandate of the central bank and run a policy for the entire euro area. This is also true of my colleagues in the Governing Council. No one there thinks in nationalist categories; that applies more to those who voice such unjustified criticisms. SPIEGEL: But ECB policy is very sceptically viewed not only by the Bundesbank, but also by the Federal Constitutional Court. Probably at the beginning of the year, the Court will decide whether the ECB’s bond-buying programme complies with the Basic Law. Are you worried about the verdict? Draghi: There is no point in thinking about a court ruling beforehand. But we are certain that with all our monetary policy decisions we are operating within our mandate. SPIEGEL: Many expect you that the judges will set a limit on government bond purchases. What will you do then? Draghi: There are already limits. We have said from the beginning that our programme would be limited to the purchase of securities with short maturities. Apart from that, we can only wait, we have no plan B. SPIEGEL: Now you need a successor to the outgoing ECB Executive Board member Asmussen. The Federal Government has nominated Sabine Lautenschläger, the current Vice-President of the Bundesbank. What do you think of her? Draghi: I have known Ms Lautenschläger for years and appreciate her work as supervisor. Appointing the members of the Governing Council is a matter for the governments of the euro area. But I would welcome it very much if the vacancy could be filled by a woman. SPIEGEL: Mr Draghi, thank you for this interview. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Deepak Mohanty: Unconventional monetary policy – the Indian experience with crisis response and policy exit Speech by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Reserve Bank Staff College (RBSC), Chennai, 26 December 2013. *      *      * The assistance provided by Binod B. Bhoi and Rajeev Jain in preparation of this paper is acknowledged. Accompanying charts can also be found on the Reserve Bank of India’s website: http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_ viewspeeches.aspx I thank Principal Uma Subramaniam for this opportunity to interact with you on unconventional monetary policy. The seminar is topical and timely. It is now 5 years since the collapse of the Lehman Brothers in September 2008, which evoked unprecedented monetary policy activism – both conventional and unconventional – across the advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs). It is for the first time on December 18, 2013 that the US Fed announced concrete measures to exit from unconventional monetary policy in a calibrated manner starting January 2014. The Indian economy like other EMEs was affected both by the global financial crisis post-Lehman and the announcement of likely exit by the US Fed in May 2013. We also resorted to both conventional and unconventional policies not only in response to the crisis but also to the announcement of exit, though there were qualitative differences in these responses. Against this backdrop, I will begin by distinguishing unconventional monetary policy from conventional policy, highlight the contours of unconventional policies in major advance economies and review the impact of such policies. I will then turn to the impact on India and our monetary policy response. I will end by drawing a few broad conclusions. Conventional and unconventional monetary policy Conventional monetary policy is understood as central banks operating with a short-term policy interest rate in the money market to signal the stance of monetary policy and in the process influence the term structure of market interest rates to achieve the objectives of price stability with sustainable growth. Price stability is not an end in itself. Price stability, defined as a low and stable inflation, is considered a prerequisite for sustainable growth over the medium-term. It is believed that there is no trade-off between growth and inflation over the medium-term. Even countries which have chosen inflation targeting framework try to stabilise output around its potential and inflation around its target level. Hence, normally in the event of a shock when either or both the parameters drift from their targets, the objective is to bring it back to target over the medium-term. However, conventional monetary policy has a limiting condition of “zero lower bond”. For example, in the event of an extreme shock, as it happened during the global financial crisis, when policy rates were brought down close to zero, further monetary stimulus was not possible through conventional monetary policy. When central banks look beyond their traditional instrument of policy interest rate, monetary policy takes an unconventional character. It essentially means using quantity instruments for expanding the balance sheet of the central bank. It can take different forms: quantitative easing (QE) through direct long-term asset purchase by the central bank, credit easing (CE) by the central bank directly intervening in a particular segment of the credit market. Both QE and CE can be accompanied by dilution of collateral standards by the central bank expanding the list of collateral beyond its traditional preference for low risk sovereign bonds. Unconventional monetary policy is invariably accompanied by forward guidance regarding the future path of monetary policy to work on the expectations channel. This is because the efficacies of asset purchases programme depend on the behaviour of market participants 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  and financial entities. It is likely that market participants may not alter their behaviour without knowing what the central bank will do in the future with regard to these instruments. In the event of a crisis, it is not unusual for central banks to expand their balance sheets. The greatest received wisdom in central banking is the lender of last resort (LOLR) function based on the Bagehot principle that, “the central bank should lend freely against good collateral at a penal rate”1. In fact, many early central banks including the US Fed were instituted to largely discharge this function. Monetary policy as we understand today was alien then. It is a different matter that the recent global financial crisis tested the limits of Bagehot principle as never before.  Contours of unconventional monetary policy Let me now turn to how the US Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) unveiled their unconventional monetary policies. I may mention that the BoJ was using unconventional monetary policy much earlier as Japan went into prolonged deflation from the late 1990s. The global financial crisis which erupted with collapse of major financial institutions in advanced economies was unprecedented in its scale. Not only did it lead to a sharp decline in asset prices, freezing of credit markets, and the loss of confidence in the building blocks of the financial system, its impact was magnified through quick transmission to other economies as well. Monetary authorities in the advanced economies were the first to resort to aggressive monetary easing first by reducing policy rates. However, key channels of conventional monetary policy were severely impaired during the crisis as policy rates in most advanced economies approached zero lower bound (Chart 1).                                                   1 Bagehot Walter (1873), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, King &Co., London; reprinted Wiley, New York 1999. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3   Taking cognisance of the severity of the crisis and concerns of economic recession, central banks used their balance sheets in unconventional ways to augment liquidity (Table 1). The QE programmes initially attempted to alleviate financial market distress, but this purpose soon broadened to include achieving inflation targets, stimulating the real economy, and containing the European sovereign debt crisis (Fawley and Neely, 2013)2. Now let us discuss a little about the rationale for unconventional policies undertaken across major economies.  Table 1                                                     2 Fawley, Brett W. and Christopher J. Neely (2013 ), “Four Stories of Quantitative Easing”, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, January/February, Vol. 95, No. 1. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In the US, immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when slow growth and high unemployment emerged as major concerns, the Fed announced the policy of quantitative easing (QE) in November 2008. The first two rounds of QEs reactivated financial markets, but failed to spur growth. Under “Operation Twist” instituted in September 2011, the Fed took initiative of buying longer-term Treasuries and simultaneously selling some of the shorter-dated securities to bring down long-term interest rates which continued till December 2012. With a view to putting in place a stronger version QE, it launched QE3 in September 2012. Under QE3, the Fed started purchasing US$85 billion of fixed-income securities per month. The Fed intended to keep QE3 in effect until unemployment falls to 6.5 per cent or inflation rises to 2.5 per cent. In addition to QE3, the Fed gave a forward guidance that it would keep short-term rates low through 2015. As economic parameters showed improvement, the Fed started talking about exit, popularly known as the tapering of bond buying in May 2013. Subsequently, it announced to slow the pace of the bond buying program by US$ 10 billion per month from January 2014. In the UK, after reducing the policy rate (i.e., Bank Rate) to 0.5 per cent in March 2009, the Bank of England (BoE) started its asset purchase programmes which consisted almost exclusively of government bonds from the non-bank private sector. Subsequently, the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) was put in place in July 2012 with the aim of incentivising banks and building societies to boost their lending to the UK real economy3.  Japan’s economy had deteriorated for nearly 15 years under the threat of deflation. To overcome deflation, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) engaged in a wide range of monetary easing efforts − including the implementation of the zero interest rate policy, the quantitative easing policy and comprehensive monetary easing, but there have been no easily derived concrete results4. Following the crisis, the BoJ embarked on an ambitious asset purchase program to combat deflation. In October 2012, it announced purchase of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), commercial paper, corporate bonds, exchange traded funds (ETF), Japanese real estate investment trusts (J-REITS). In April 2013, BoJ announced Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing Program under which it purchases JGBs, ETFs and J-REITs with the goal of increasing the monetary base by 60–70 trillion JPY annually, increasing the average maturity of JGBs held from three to seven years and meeting the 2 per cent inflation target in about two years. In the euro area, concerns over counter-party risk eventually led to drying up of interbank lending by early 2009. The European Central Bank (ECB) responded in May 2009, by reducing its main refinancing rate to 1 per cent and by introducing 12-month LTROs and the covered bond purchase program (CBPP). The ECB substantially extended its liquidity provision by offering unlimited longer-term refinancing operations. The ECB also purchased some securities outright in distressed markets through its securities markets program (SMP), which was, however, later replaced by the pledge to intervene more decisively through Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs). The unconventional measures undertaken have involved extraordinary central bank lending, expanding central bank balance sheets substantially (Chart 2). We learn from text books and the inflation experiences of the 1970s that a sharp increase in base money could be inflationary. On the contrary, in the current episode inflation declined below target levels in many advanced countries.                                                 3 Bank of England (2012), “The Funding for Lending Scheme”, Quarterly Bulletin 2012 Q4. 4 Kuroda, Haruhiko (2013), “Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing”, Speech at a Meeting held by the Yomiuri International Economic Society in Tokyo, April 12. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5    Partly the explanation lies in the fact that despite such increase in the size of balance sheets, broad money supply did not expand significantly. This was due to perceptible decline in money multiplier on account of banks building up cash reserves on being risk averse and to conserve on required capital rather than lending to the real economy (Chart 3). Moreover, with interest rates at near zero level, the opportunity costs of holding money for the money holding sector also fell. Another interesting explanation is that inflation expectations remained well anchored, meaning once economic entities believe that inflation will not go up it does not go up. Further, with the economy operating below its capacity the scope for inflation from wage increase is not there. While consumer price inflation may not rise in the short run, it cannot be presumed that asset price inflation will not go up given the excess liquidity.   
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The large scale economic downturn accompanying the financial crisis also led to activation of counter-cyclical fiscal policy of unprecedented magnitude. The fiscal measures focused on improving the balance sheet of the financial and corporate sectors as reflected in large scale bailouts in the US and other advanced economies. Reflecting such fiscal stimulus measures, advanced economies witnessed significant deterioration in their fiscal position as reflected in high public debt to GDP ratios (Chart 4). Let me now turn to the experience of EMEs.   Experience of EMEs Initially, it was viewed that EMEs would remain insulated from global financial meltdown on the back of the significant buffers they have built over the years, which included substantial foreign exchange reserves, improved policy frameworks and generally robust banking sector and corporate balance sheets. However, as the crisis deepened following the failure of Lehman Brothers and resulted in heightened risk aversion and global deleveraging, the EMEs were also affected in varying degrees. The contagion from the global financial crisis also warranted swift monetary and fiscal policy responses in EMEs with a view to ensuring orderly functioning of markets, preserving financial stability, and moderating its adverse effects on growth. In the process, their policy responses became more synchronised with global efforts (Mohanty, 2011)5. While both developed economies and EMEs resorted to conventional and unconventional monetary measures, there were certain differences in terms of their timing, types and magnitudes. First, while in the advanced economies the switchover was from conventional monetary tools to unconventional measures due to policy rates approaching zero, in many EMEs, unconventional foreign exchange easing and domestic liquidity augmenting measures                                                 5 Mohanty, Deepak (2011), “Lessons for Monetary Policy from the Global Financial Crisis: An Emerging Market Perspective”, RBI Bulletin, April. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  preceded the conventional measures of policy rate cuts. Second, while central banks in EMEs relied mostly on direct instruments such as reserve requirements to ease domestic liquidity, central banks in advanced countries resorted to various liquidity providing operations through relaxation of counter-parties, collaterals and maturity. Third, central banks in advanced countries extensively used credit and quantitative easing measures which led to large expansion of their balance sheets unlike in EMEs. Fourth, while in advanced economies fiscal support aimed at rescuing the financial sector from the crisis situation, in EMEs they were generally meant to address the deficiency in aggregate demand. Let me now turn to some of the consequences of unconventional policy. Impact of unconventional policies As most of the unconventional monetary policy measures were undertaken keeping in view the domestic economies, the attendant increase in global liquidity appears to have impacted a range of asset classes in both advanced and emerging economies (Chart 5). There are studies which find significant impact of QE. They suggest reduction in US treasury yields around 100 basis points, corporate bond yields by 80 basis points, and reduction in the range of 20–80 basis points in other advanced economies6. In case of some EMEs, the evidence suggested high capital inflow pressure, rapid domestic credit growth and domestic inflationary pressures.                                                 6 Chen, Q., A. Filardo, D. He and F. Zhu (2012), “International Spillovers of Central Bank Balance Sheet Policies”, in BIS Papers No. 66. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches    Furthermore, indications about the possible withdrawal since the talk about US taper in May 2013 has caused volatility in financial markets in EMEs and impacted currency valuations as capital retreated back to the US in anticipation of higher interest rates. EMEs, particularly with large current account and fiscal deficits, were severely impacted. Let me turn to our experience with the crisis, and now with the talk of taper. Indian experience with the crisis and policy exit Until the emergence of the global crisis, India had experienced a phase of high growth along with low and stable inflation. Growth was largely driven by high domestic demand – growing domestic investment financed mostly by domestic savings and sustained consumption demand. Sequential financial sector reforms, rule-based fiscal policy and forward looking monetary policy together contributed to the overall improved macroeconomic performance. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Following the emergence of the crisis, India, initially remained somewhat insulated to the global developments, but eventually was impacted significantly through all the channels – financial, real and more importantly, the confidence channel (Subbarao, 2009)7. This could be attributed to the global nature of the crisis on the one hand and accelerated trade and financial integration of the Indian economy with the world on the other. The impact of the crisis was first visible on India’s financial markets in the form of tightening of liquidity and higher volatility in all market segments along with sharp decline in stock prices. Risk aversion on the part of global investors resulted in moderation in capital inflows and exchange rate depreciation. Credit growth decelerated reflecting weakening business confidence. Growth, which was already on a cyclical moderation in the first half of 2008–09, decelerated significantly during the second half. As a result, growth declined to 6.7 per cent in 2008–09 from the preceding 5-year average of 8.7 per cent per annum (Table 2). Table 2   Restoring normalcy in financial markets, ensuring normal flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy as well as limiting the adverse impact on the real sector of the economy assumed policy priority. The Reserve Bank, like most other central banks, took a number of conventional and unconventional measures to limit the adverse impact of the contagion on the Indian financial markets and the economy. These included augmenting domestic and foreign exchange liquidity and a sharp reduction in the policy rate. The Reserve Bank used multiple instruments such as the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), open market operations (OMO), cash reserve ratio (CRR) and securities under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) to augment the liquidity in the system. These measures were supported by fiscal stimulus packages which raised the fiscal deficit of the Central Government by about 3.5 per cent of GDP to 6.0 per cent in 2008–09 (Chart 6).                                                 7 Subbarao, D. (2009), “Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on India: Collateral Damage and Response”, Speech delivered at the Symposium on “The Global Economic Crisis and Challenges for the Asian Economy in a Changing World” organised by the Institute for International Monetary Affairs, Tokyo, February 18. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches   On the back of substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus, growth bounced back quickly. However, inflation also picked up. Consequently, the policy focus shifted to exit from accommodative monetary policy in a calibrated manner starting in October 2009. To begin with all special liquidity measures were withdrawn which was followed by hikes in policy rate. As the real policy rate turned positive it started to have an impact on inflation. Going into the financial year 2012–13, growth declined and headline WPI inflation showed a clear sign of moderation. This prompted the Reserve Bank to reduce the policy rate (Chart 7).  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  As the economic conditions appeared to be stabilising, volatility in the financial market returned following the announcement in May 2013 of the Fed’s intention of likely tapering of QE. This prompted the Reserve Bank to resort to somewhat unconventional monetary policy measures besides drawing down of foreign exchange reserves to meet the immediate shortfall (Chart 8). Let me give you the flavour of key measures.    • In terms of monetary policy, the upper bound of the policy rate corridor (i.e., MSF rate) was raised by 200 basis points and the quantity of central bank liquidity available through the LAF window was restrained. This had the desired effect of tightening the monetary conditions and raising the effective policy rate sharply to the MSF rate. • In order to signal that the above measure is temporary so that the interest rates at the longer end do not harden a form of operation twist was tried by conducting outright OMO purchase of government securities alongside sale of short-term government cash management bills. This inverted the yield curve, though accompanied by some increase in long-term rates. • With a view to containing the current account deficit (CAD) on the balance of payments (BoP), gold imports were restricted. • The non-resident deposit schemes and banks’ borrowing abroad were further liberalised with incentives for swapping these inflows directly with the Reserve Bank. This substantially augmented foreign exchange reserves despite some outflow on account of directly meeting the foreign exchange requirement of oil imports.  As portfolio capital outflows waned and BoP improved, stability returned to the foreign exchange market. This prompted the Reserve Bank to unwind the bulk of the exceptional measures and normalise monetary policy by restoring the policy interest rate corridor to its original position and the repo rate to its signalling role of policy. Though the policy repo rate was increased by 25 basis points each in September and November 2013, this was more on considerations of emerging growth and inflation balance. 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Conclusion Let me conclude. First, the global financial crisis triggered unprecedented policy activism by advance country central banks. They resorted to unconventional monetary policy of the nature and scale unthinkable hitherto. Second, as we complete over 5 years of unconventional monetary policy of QE and CE, the question is: did it succeed? While it is too early to say, opinion remains divided. Thus far, with unconventional policies, the central banks have been far less successful in stimulating growth8. While it may not have improved general monetary transmission and prompted sustainable recovery, it did have significant impact on the financial market. The counterfactual of what would have happened without QE is not known? In any case, it seems to have prevented a deeper recession.  Third, the spillover effect of QE on commodity markets and emerging market economies (EMEs) has been significant. This has resulted in increased volatility of capital flows and elevated asset prices. The initiation of exit from QE has also created additional macroeconomic challenges for EMEs including India. Fourth, the Indian economy and financial markets were significantly impacted by the global financial crisis and the recent signalling of exit from QE by the Fed. This prompted the Reserve Bank to resort to both conventional and unconventional monetary policy alongside other regulatory policies to stabilise markets. Finally, while the exit from QE increases uncertainties in the financial market, it is increasingly felt that continuation of unconventional monetary policy for long could create risks in the global economy it sought to address by preventing deleveraging and appropriate pricing of risks. In addition, the current policy response has increased sovereign risk in a number of countries which circumscribes the ability of policy to cushion further unexpected shocks.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Deepak Mohanty: Economic and financial developments in Mizoram Speech by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Aizawl Club, Mizoram, 19 December 2013. *      *      * The assistance provided by P.K. Nayak, S. Suraj and S. Nath is acknowledged. I am happy to be in this picturesque state of Mizoram, the land of rolling hills, valleys, rivers and lakes. The state has a strategic location as it shares much of its border with Bangladesh and Myanmar. It covers 0.6 per cent of the national geographic area and accounts for 0.1 per cent of national population. With second highest literacy rate in the country, the state has great potential for economic development. Access to finance is an important prerequisite for economic development. In the recent years the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has pursued the objective of financial inclusion with renewed vigour. Some progress has been achieved but there are miles to go. Governor Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan has emphasised financial inclusion as one of the five pillars of the RBI’s financial development plank : “… to expand access to finance to small and medium enterprises, the unorganised sector, the poor, and remote and underserved areas of the country, though technology, new business practices and new organisational structure.”1 Financial inclusion poses additional challenges in the north-eastern states given the relatively low level of banking penetration and inadequate infrastructure. Against this background, I briefly delineate the economic and financial structure of the state, highlight our financial inclusion initiatives and conclude with some thoughts on policy challenges on the way forward.  Economic structure India experienced accelerated GDP growth rate in the 2000s. Obviously, this growth experience was shared by many states. In line with the national economy, Mizoram also experienced pick up in its growth. Even as the growth momentum at the national level was dented following the onset of global financial crisis in 2007–08, the performance of Mizoram’s economy was better even in the post-crisis period. Consequently, the share of Mizoram’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) in the all-India GDP rose from 0.08 per cent in  2006–07 to 0.10 per cent during 2011–12 (Chart 1).                                                  1 “The Five Pillars of RBI’s Financial Sector Policies”, speech by Governor Raghuram G. Rajan at BANCON 2013 held at Mumbai on November 15, 2013. RBI Monthly Bulletin, December 2013. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  All the three major sectors of the economy – agriculture, industry and services – contributed to the improved growth performance of the state. There was, however, significant year-to-year fluctuation in sectoral growth rates. While variation in agricultural growth is understandable being weather dependent, volatility in industrial growth needs closer attention, given the low industrial base of the state (Chart 2).    The sectoral composition of the Mizoram economy has broadly changed in line with the national economy with declining share of agriculture and increasing share of services. While the share of industry has picked up, it remains significantly below the national average underscoring the scope for further industrialisation (Chart 3).  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The most significant impact of growth has been improvement of per capita net state domestic product (NSDP) from ₹26,308 in 2006–07 to ₹39,546 in 2011–12 at 2004–05 prices, despite a larger decadal population growth rate of 22.8 per cent, which is higher than the rate of growth at 17.6 per cent at the national level. Notably, per capita income of Mizoram was about 4.0 per cent higher than the corresponding average national per capita income during 2011–12 (Chart 4).    It is worthwhile to note that while the economy of Mizoram, in line with the national trend, is getting increasingly dominated by industry and services sectors, labour force is still concentrated in the agricultural sector (Table 1). Therefore, creating employment opportunities in the manufacturing and services sectors has become important. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Table 1  Share of employment by broad industry group   A higher proportion of working age (ages 15–59) population in rural Mizoram as compared to rural India provides a favourable condition for growth (Chart 5). But for this to happen, industry and services sectors should increasingly provide the employment opportunity.   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Social indicators With greater urbanisation and higher literacy, indicators of human development in Mizoram are better than the national average (Chart 6).    Share of households having access to the basic amenities like electricity, television, computers, telephones and four wheelers are significantly higher in Mizoram than the national average (Table 2). On the other hand, proportion of population having access to banking facilities, although improved during the decade 2001–2011, was below the national level. This is a policy challenge in the context of development with increasing emphasis on financial inclusion. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Table 2 Standards of life indicators: Mizoram and India  State finances Mizoram is one of the 11 special category states which are characterised by low resource base and the cost disabilities due to their geography, sparse terrain and remoteness. In order to overcome these inadequacies, the Centre accords special consideration in devolving resources from the central pool. The revenue account of Mizoram showed significant improvement following a rule-based fiscal policy under Mizoram FRBM Act 2006. However, the correction in revenue account was largely on account of higher transfers from the Centre, since own tax revenue continued to remain around 2.3 per cent of GSDP. From the perspective of growth and employment, a key concern is the decline in capital outlay in terms of GSDP (Table 3). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Table 3 Fiscal position of Mizoram  Banking developments The banking sector penetration in Mizoram may be seen in the context of its special characteristics of difficult terrain and economic structure. Agriculture is characterised by hill and mountain cultivation and industry is dominated by micro and small units. The population per bank branch in Mizoram declined from 11,400 in June 2001 to 9,100 by June 2013 and thus was much lower than the all-India average of 11,800 (Chart 7) reflecting better coverage of banking services.  
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  However, Credit-Deposit (C-D) ratio remained significantly lower than the all-India average (Chart 8). Moreover, C-D ratio in Mizoram has declined in the more recent years. It could partly be that deposits have grown faster.    The annual deposit growth rate of Mizoram was significantly higher than the national average. However, the credit growth rate has fallen short of the national average after  2007–08 (Chart 9). This underscores the need for a deeper analysis of credit information: Is it lack of demand or lack of supply which is constraining credit flow?   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  The lower credit flow is also mirrored by credit to GDP ratio which is another measure of financial deepening. The credit-GSDP ratio in Mizoram has improved more modestly from 13.7 per cent in 2004–05 to 18.7 per cent in 2011–12, as compared to the increase from 39.0 per cent to 57.3 per cent at the national level (Chart 10).   Financial inclusion The Reserve Bank is committed to Financial Inclusion (FI) so that the banking services touch every section of our society. It is imperative to bring the poor and under-privileged section of population under the banking fold for inclusive growth and development. In this regard, the Reserve Bank has adopted a structured approach towards financial inclusion predominantly through a bank-led model by leveraging appropriate technology, changing the mode of delivery and increasing financial literacy. In this context, I may highlight four key elements. First, ensuring branch expansion in the rural areas by giving full freedom to the banks to open branches in villages. In fact, recently the branch authorisation policy has been fully liberalised subject to banks opening at least 25 per cent of their branches in the rural areas. In addition, the Reserve Bank has enabled commercial banks to operate through their Business Correspondents (BCs) thus taking banking to the door step in the rural areas. Second, for providing universal coverage and facilitating Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) by leveraging Aadhar identification, banks have been advised to draw up their Financial Inclusion Plans (FIPs) for the period 2013–16 with greater emphasis on opening of branches in unbanked rural centres. Third, provision of suitable financial products aimed towards the vulnerable section of population such as no-frill account, credit through General Credit Card (GCC) and Kisan Credit Card (KCC). Moreover, Know Your Customer (KYC) norm required for opening of a bank account has been relaxed especially for rural and under-privileged population. Finally, efforts are made towards spread of financial literacy including internet based curriculum for financial literacy in schools and organising financial literacy camps. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In this direction, banks have covered all the unbanked villages with population over 2,000. The second phase of this movement aims to achieve the target of financial inclusion in about 4,90,000 villages with population less than 2,000. The identified villages have been allotted to various banks to ensure availability of at least one banking outlet in each village. The detailed achievement in the recent financial inclusion drive is summarised in Table 4.  Table 4  Progress made under financial inclusion plans  Progress of financial inclusion in Mizoram Keeping in mind the topographic challenges and locational disadvantages for the development of extensive banking outreach, banks have been advised to adopt special measures for FI in the north-eastern region of India. Since December 2009, the domestic scheduled commercial banks in the country, excluding RRBs, were permitted to open branch in any location in the region without taking permission from the Reserve Bank. Let me now turn specifically to progress of financial inclusion in Mizoram. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  As a part of the Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) adopted in Mizoram, all the unbanked villages in the state with population of 2,000 or more have been covered by banking facility by end-March 2012. Another 700 villages having population below 2,000 have already been identified. Out of these villages, 106 have been proposed to be covered through brick and mortar model while rest would be covered through Business Correspondence (BC) model. As at end-September 2013, there were 2, 27,812 Basic Saving Bank Deposit Accounts (BSBDAs) in Mizoram, while another 10,777 such accounts with overdraft facilities are targeted to be opened during the year 2013–14. In addition, 11,642 KCC and GCC are targeted to be provided to the households during 2013–14. Out of the 8 districts in the State, so far 5 financial literacy centres (FLCs) have been opened. As of end-September 2013 cumulatively 3,063 Self Help Groups (SHGs) were credit-linked and have been provided with total credit of ₹1,650 lakh. Policy challenges Mizoram economy has performed well in the recent years. However, keeping in view the young population and high literacy and strategic location, there is considerable scope for growth and development. Let me conclude by drawing attention to a few challenges. First, the dominant feature of the hill and mountain farming in Mizoram is sloping marginal farmlands under rain-fed farming. Subsistence farming on these lands is pervasive. Expansion of land for cultivation in an environmentally sustainable manner may be limited. The emphasis in agriculture, therefore, may shift towards high value added horticulture for which there is tremendous potential. This will also require greater penetration of credit in agriculture. Second, industrial development in Mizoram started late in the 1990s, mainly after attaining statehood. The industrial landscape is dominated by micro and small industries. There is a need to reinforce this process by facilitating access to markets and formal credit. Third, weak market linkages with the rest of India coupled with lack of good quality road and absence of railway network inhibits the effective marketing of goods. Therefore, priority should be given to the development of infrastructure, especially roads and also provision of post harvest management, cold storage and processing facilities. There is also the need to further harness the hydro-power capacity. Better accessibility will also help develop the services sector, particularly tourism, which could become a significant source of employment and revenue. Finally, the topography of the state and infrastructure bottlenecks together work as a deterrent for the development of physical banking and financial infrastructure. Hence, greater reliance may need to be placed on technology to make banking more accessible to the majority of the population. This will require improvement in telecommunication facility. I thank you for inviting me to share my thoughts on financial inclusion in the state. Tomorrow, I hope to see some of you at our outreach programme at Tanhril village. With the combined effort of state administration, banks and the Reserve Bank we could together make a significant impact in financial inclusion.

Samaraweera, Auditor General; Deputy Governors and my colleagues at the Central Bank; Vice President and Council Members of CA Sri Lanka; Mr. N. R. Gajendran, Chairman, and Members of the Tax Faculty of CA Sri Lanka; Mr. Esmond Satarasinghe; Fellow Chartered Accountants; Members of the Business Community; My dear friends, At the outset, let me thank CA Sri Lanka for inviting me to deliver the 18th Annual Oration on Taxation organized by the Faculty of Taxation of CA Sri Lanka. I consider myself deeply privileged to have this unique opportunity. I am further pleased because the topic of the Oration, “Harmonizing Fiscal and Monetary Policies to deliver sustainable growth and Stability” is one that is relevant and timely, since there are a large number of global and national developments which regularly underscore the vital importance of harmonization of the Monetary and Fiscal policies in countries as well as in regions.  Monetary policy and fiscal policy In order to set the backdrop for today’s Oration, let me initially provide you with a brief insight as to what Monetary policy and Fiscal policy entails. Monetary policy is the means by which a central bank seeks to achieve macro-economic stability. In Sri Lanka, the authority responsible for the formulation and implementation of monetary policy is the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 is the legislation under which the Central Bank (CB) was established, and it provides a wide range of instruments that could be used by the Central Bank for monetary management. Developments in the economy and the financial system have led to a gradual evolution of the objectives, and the framework for the conduct of monetary policy. In 2002, in an amendment to the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the objectives of the Central Bank 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  were re-defined as “economic and price stability” and “financial system stability”, with a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka. Fiscal policy is the framework that is implemented by the government in order to influence economic activities via the allocation of resources towards achieving the overall goals of stability and growth. This policy framework is mainly implemented through the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in Sri Lanka, with the traditional policy tools used for this purpose being taxation, government expenditure & borrowing, and debt management. In the meantime, it would also be noted that the financing of the budget and debt management has monetary implications, while the composition of debt instruments, the timing of debt issues and their maturities, has a close relationship with both fiscal and monetary implications. We need to understand that Fiscal policy is broader than taxation. Therefore, perhaps the next post-budget seminar of the Institute should attempt to convey this position so that the popular misconception amongst many Chartered Accountants that “fiscal policy is only about taxation” is removed, thereby encouraging Accountants to focus on fundamental fiscal philosophies and implementation methods at their important pre and post-budget seminars. Needless to say, a greater appreciation of the entirety of the fiscal policies would enable Chartered Accountants to pay more attention to the wide range of subjects encompassing fiscal policy, so that the Accountants’ knowledge and ideas in this field could be regularly harnessed for the benefit of the country at large. Mr. Chairman, while it may be reasonably easy to define what Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy means, it would not be so easy to define as to under whose purview such policies would fall into, when it comes to implementation. Of course, it is clear that the bulk of the Monetary Policy would be the direct responsibility of the Central Bank, and the bulk of the Fiscal Policy would be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. However, there are several grey areas and overlaps, which blur the boundaries of these policy frameworks, and therefore, there are many instances of policy actions of one institution impacting and influencing upon the policy framework of the other, and vice versa. Relationship between the central bank and the ministry of finance With that in mind, let us now examine as to how the relationship between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance have been structured according to our Laws. Mr. Chairman, as I already stated, the basic law governing the operations of the Monetary Board and the Central Bank, is the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949. The Monetary Law Act, (popularly called the MLA), covers the powers and purposes of the Central Bank, Monetary Board, Governor and Deputy Governors, Departments of the Central Bank, Reports and Publications, Profits and Losses and the Accounts of the Bank etc. In addition, chapters are devoted to the powers and purposes of the Central Bank, National Monetary Policy, instruments of the Central Bank, and the Central Bank’s relationship with the Government. What perhaps is most relevant for today’s discussion is how the MLA has defined the Central Bank’s relationship with the Government. Towards that end, a careful examination of the MLA as well as John Exter’s “Report on the establishment of the Central Bank of Ceylon” in November 1949, (popularly called the Exter Report), will provide some useful insights as to the objectives and background of one of the most important pieces of legislation in our country. At this stage, a quick introduction of John Exter may also be relevant. John Exter was a senior official of the Federal Reserve System who was seconded for service in late 1948, to the Government of Ceylon by the US Government, to advise the Government of Ceylon about the organization and the functions of a Reserve Bank for Ceylon, and to frame proposals for a draft constitution for the Reserve Bank of Ceylon. Exter who was a brilliant banker and scholar, fulfilled his mission and was thereafter appointed as the first Governor of the Central Bank of Ceylon in 1950. John Exter’s Report, now serves as the most important 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and authoritative reference for Central Bankers in Sri Lanka, and is referred to often by academics and practitioners of Central Banking, whenever a clarification is required on any issue relating to central banking in Sri Lanka. Getting back to our topic, what does this analysis of the MLA reveal? In my view, some very interesting positions: First: The MLA has been designed to ensure that the Central Bank functions as an independent body, with a high degree of autonomy to fashion and implement its policies, which have far reaching implications for the people. Mr. Chairman, let me now cite from the first paragraph of the Exter Report where he deals with the significance of the Central Bank System. I quote: “The decision of the Government of Ceylon to establish a central bank was a decision with far reaching implications for the people of Ceylon. One implication already stands out very clearly: in taking steps to establish an independent monetary system to be administered by a central bank, the Government has demonstrated unmistakably its intention to achieve genuine economic freedom as a corollary of the political freedom achieved a year and a half ago.” Having set the stage, Exter goes on to elaborate the responsibilities to be undertaken by the Central Bank: “A central bank thus undertakes a great responsibility, and the broad powers given to the Central Bank of Ceylon under the draft bill in Part II of this report are commensurate with the magnitude of this responsibility. The Bank should not be hampered by rigid limitations which might prevent it from fulfilling its purpose.” Second: Exter reports on the need for the Central Bank to function in the context of the other agencies of government. He reports, and I quote: “Under the draft law, the Central Bank will be the principal monetary authority, but it is obvious that it cannot exercise its authority in the monetary field as in a water-tight compartment, from which the various ministries and other agencies of the Government, are excluded. There is no fine line separating monetary policy from other policies, such as fiscal and trade policies. The Minister of Finance through his fiscal policy, or the Minister of Commerce and Trade through his authority to control imports and exports, can exert a powerful influence upon monetary conditions in Ceylon. But it is the clear intent of the Bill to concentrate, in so far as it is considered practicable and constitutional to do, as much monetary authority and responsibility as possible in a single regulatory and operating agency – the Central Bank”. Third: The Monetary Law Act (Chapter 6) envisages the Central Bank acting as the Fiscal Agent, Banker and Financial Advisor to the Government. Sections 106, 113, and 114 set out clearly the Central Bank’s role in relation to the management of the public debt and the borrowings by the Government and any agencies of Government. Those Sections read as follows: “Section 106. (1) The Central Bank shall act as the fiscal agent and banker of the Government and of agencies or institutions acting on behalf of the Government, whether established by any written law or otherwise.” “Section 113. The Central Bank shall, as agent of the Government, be responsible for the management of the public debt.” “Section 114. No new loan shall be raised and no new issue of stock or debentures shall be made by the Government or by any agency or institution referred to in subsection (1) of section 106, whether in pursuance of authority conferred by any written law or otherwise, unless the advice of the Monetary Board has first been obtained upon the monetary implication of the proposed loan or issue.” 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The Exter Report elaborates the thinking behind these sections: “In a small country like Ceylon, it is clearly advantageous to place the responsibility for co-ordinating the activities of all Government credit institutions in the Monetary Board of the Central Bank. The Board determines monetary and credit policy in general, and should have some means of ensuring that the policies of other credit institutions conform.” He further clarifies: “The Board should be able to co-ordinate both the borrowing and the lending and investment operations of such institutions. With respect to borrowing, co-ordination is necessary in order to prevent separate Government agencies from competing with each other and ‘spoiling’ the market, especially in the early stages of its development, and to make possible the formulation of a properly diversified pattern of interest rates and maturities for the entire Government borrowing program.” Those Sections of the MLA that I referred to, and the relevant annotations in Exter’s Report, strongly suggest that the Central Bank should play a dynamic role in the formulation of fiscal policy, particularly in relation to a significant part of fiscal policy’s sphere of influence, namely that of borrowing and lending. In that context, it may be safely argued that, whilst the overwhelming responsibility for monetary policy has to be assumed by the Central Bank, a sizeable part of the responsibility in relation to fiscal policy is also cast upon the Central Bank. Fourth: Exter explains the unique position of the Governor, and the need for the Governor to be independent. This position is assured by the fact that the Governor is appointed for a 6 year term and cannot be removed from office, unless he has done any act, which in the opinion of the Governor General, (now, the President), is of a fraudulent or illegal character, or is against the interest of the Central Bank. Fifth: Exter discusses the limitations of the Central Bank: Once again, let me quote: “A central bank influences the economic life of a nation principally by monetary action. While such action can be tremendously effective under certain conditions, its limitations should be frankly recognized. Thus, through its control of money the Central Bank can assist, but by no means ensure, the achievement of the above objects. A monetary system that is stable and at the same time responsive to the needs of a growing country is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition of orderly economic development.” Sixth: Exter reports on the vital importance of harmonizing between the Government policies and the Central Bank policies. Here, Exter’s comments are unambiguous and far reaching. I quote: “There are, however, many important problems of monetary policy, especially those relating to fiscal policy, on which a central bank must necessarily work in close harmony with the government. On such problems, experience in many countries has shown that a central bank, with a degree of independence of the government proper, can make economic analyses and hold views which are more detached and objective than those of a government department. Many governments have learned to value and to use the sort of independent and objective advice on monetary and other aspects of economic policy which central banks have been able to give. On matters of vital interest to the state, however, it must be recognized that… it would be impossible for the Central Bank to adopt a policy or pursue a course of action contrary to the policy of the Government of the day. No agency which is a creature of the Government can be entirely independent of the Government. While the Government may be prepared to give an independent regulatory agency rather wide discretion in a field such as that of money, there is no gain-saying that, in the last analysis, the Government must assume responsibility for monetary policy as for other policies. The Governor and the appointed member of the Monetary Board cannot help being acutely conscious of the fact that, since no Parliament can bind its successors, their independence and tenure in office 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  under the proposed legislation is limited by the ultimate power of the Government to change the law.” Exter also makes a further useful observation: “The exact degree and independence of the Central Bank is likely to vary from time to time. For example, central banks can ordinarily act more independently in stable, peace-time economic conditions, than in time of war or other national emergency. They also tend to take stronger stands on issues which are primarily monetary in character, than on related issues which may simply have monetary repercussions”. Seventh: Exter describes the ideal situation as contemplated by the MLA. I quote once again: “The ideal which it is hoped that the proposed law will achieve is one in which there will be continuous and constructive co-operation between the Monetary Board and the Government. The principal instrument for achieving this co-operation should be the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, whose membership on the Board will ensure at all times, that his Minister’s views will be made known to the other members of the Board. The effectiveness of this cooperation and co-ordination between the Board and the Government will depend more upon the men occupying the key positions at particular times than upon any legal formula, no matter how carefully or elaborately it might be worked out. A relationship as complex, and sometimes as delicate, as this one is certain to be, cannot be established full-blown by a piece of legislation. It must be the result, as in other countries, of years of experience and the slow growth of political conventions.” A reading and understanding of these Exter annotations clearly indicate the delicate and complex nature of the envisaged relationship between these two vital institutions, and the men (or women!) occupying the key positions. It would also be observed that Exter is suggesting, and the MLA is legislating, a somewhat paradoxical situation. On the one hand, (now, I am speaking like a traditional Economist!), the Central Bank must exercise a high degree of independence, while, on the other hand, the Central Bank must act in harmonization with the policies of the Government! It is of course obvious that this paradox is not unintentional, and has, in fact, been carefully thought through and deliberately introduced, and has obviously been done in order to establish an extremely vital and far reaching principle. That is, the need for the Central Bank to retain intellectual and operational independence, but to temper it with the pragmatism of the national deliverables of the economic agenda that has been decided by a democratically elected government. Going further, Exter’s comment that “the effectiveness of this cooperation and coordination between the Board and the Government will depend more upon the men occupying the key positions at particular times, than upon any legal formula”, emphasizes the complexity and the delicateness of the relationship, which he has described in lucid and clever language.  Mr. Chairman, All these positions that I described to you now highlight another very important fundamental principle that was set out in Exter’s Central Bank Report of 1949. That is, Exter’s wise words that “good central banking is less good law than good practice”. After 7 years as the Governor, I can tell you that that is one of the wisest comments in the Exter Report, and an appreciation of that principle must be understood by all stakeholders, especially at the current turbulent times, when Sri Lanka is on a fast track to economic development. In fact, over the past several decades, monetary policy objectives, instruments and operating mechanisms have changed significantly. Today, in the aftermath of global financial crisis, the key focus of central banks is both the successful conduct of monetary policy and macroprudential policy, in order to reinforce each other to stabilize economies. In Sri Lanka too, monetary policy formulation, operational framework and strategies adopted, have all evolved in line with the changing structure of the economy, developments in the financial markets, and the availability of data and communication strategies. I do not intend to discuss 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  these changes in detail here, but would like to highlight that a greater coordination of monetary and fiscal policies would become even more crucial in the implementation of monetary policy and achieving macroeconomic stability, in the future than in the past. Another position that should be clear to us is that the need for harmonization between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, is not a virtue that has been suggested recently, but a vital ingredient that had been provided for, since the establishment of the Central Bank, in order to ensure the sound economic management of the country. The recent evolution of our economy Armed with that background, I would now like to proceed to share with you, some instances of harmonization that has taken place in the recent past in our country. However, before I do that, I think it is necessary to first touch upon the recent evolution of our economy in order to set the stage for what would follow. To do so, let us initially examine a snap shot of our economy in 2005. Growth in 2005 was 6.2%, with the average growth for the 7 years, 1999 to 2005, being 4.3%; Foreign reserves were around US$ 2.7 billion, or about the equivalent of 2 ½ months imports; The country was at the mercy of a ruthless terrorist group and on the brink of war; Unemployment was at 7.2%; Poverty was at a level over 15%; Inflation was on a sharp rising trend; The banking system was vulnerable and displaying several worrisome cracks; Public debt to GDP level exceeded 90%; Per capita income was under US$1,250; GDP was around US$24 billion; The Western Province share of GDP was an overwhelming 51%; Infrastructure development was almost non-existent; The fiscal deficit was over 7% although very little infrastructure development work had been carried out. All in all, a rather bleak picture, and worse still, a bleak outlook. Let us now see what it is like today: Growth is over 7%, and average growth from 2006 to 2012 has been 6.7%; Growth appears to be on course to reach around the 8% level from next year; Foreign reserves exceed US$ 6.3 billion and around 4.4 months of imports; The country enjoys peaceful and stable conditions; Foreign investment inflows are strong and foreign Investment via international sovereign bonds and Government paper amounts to about US$7.0 billion; Unemployment is around 3.6%; Poverty is down to about the 6% mark; Inflation has been at single digit levels over the past 4 ½ years; GDP is at about US$60 billion; Per capita income is around US$ 3,000; The economy is being diversified under a 5Hub + Tourism strategy to avoid the middle income trap; The Fiscal deficit has been limited to 6.4% in 2012, and on a reducing trend; The Debt to GDP level is below 80% and falling; The level of infrastructure has improved tremendously; The Doing Business global rank is at the 81st, and is poised to jump about 10 places this year; Regional development has made tangible progress and the Western Province share of GDP has dropped to around 43%; Regular foreign investment is flowing into banks and the stock market; Private remittances have reached nearly 10% of GDP, or about US$ 6 billion in actual inflows; The banking system has been stable and even in the midst of very difficult global circumstances, the country enjoys favourable reviews from many influential international quarters. Mr. Chairman, a dispassionate comparison of the conditions prevailing in 2006 and 2013 tells us that our economy has made an unprecedented transformation over the past 7 years, with strong economic growth, and stable macro-economic conditions. Harmonization of monetary and fiscal policies – case studies The discussion point that then arises is, as to what factors, processes and conditions contributed to this current level of growth and stability. Of course, we are all aware that many factors contributed to the current state of affairs of the country, and those could be the subject of, maybe 50 other Orations! But, for today’s discussion, let us confine ourselves 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  to examining the background of some significant initiatives that would have influenced the current state of the economy, and to understand how the present day outcomes were supported and/or impacted by the harmonization of the Fiscal and Monetary policies. One striking feature in the implementation of Monetary and Fiscal policy over the past 7 years, has been that both institutions, MoF and CB have been taking a keen and enduring interest in both monetary and fiscal policies. We realized that a “blame game” would be of no value to the country or to the stakeholders, and that it was absolutely vital that we should deliver on both fronts simultaneously. Mr. Chairman, having said that, we will now discuss some case studies that would throw some light about the degree of harmonization that took place between the policies of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, in order to deliver some of the vital results to our country and economy, over the past 7 years. Case Study 1: Opening out Sri Lanka Treasury Bills and Bonds to foreign investors Mr. Chairman, the first case study that I would like to cite is the November 2006 move to open out Sri Lanka Treasury bills and bonds to foreign investors. By late 2006, in Sri Lanka, a massive infrastructure development programme had been launched, and the critical humanitarian operation had begun. These twin programmes had demanded a regular, steady and massive flow of funds, and it was becoming increasingly clear that we would not be able to secure the new fund requirements only via local taxes and local borrowing. If such a quantum of funds were to be sourced from within, an enormous pressure would have been exerted upon the entire economy. In fact, such an attempt would have pushed interest rates to unacceptable levels, and may have even dragged the economy towards negative territory, and placed the entire monetary system at considerable risk. Such fears may have perhaps been one of the reasons that prompted successive governments of the past, to avoid large scale infrastructure development programmes or attempt to launch a full scale counter action programme against terrorism. However, the government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa took the bold decision to undertake both these missions, and the fiscal and monetary authorities had then to find innovative ways to support those missions, without placing the economy under undue risk or peril. As a response therefore, in late 2006, the Treasury and the Central Bank decided to open out a small portion of the Government Treasury bills and bonds to foreign investors. This was the first move to attract foreign investment into Government rupee paper, and it was naturally a fresh and exciting experience for both the Sri Lankan authorities as well as foreign investors. You may note that I said, “foreign investment”, and not “foreign direct investment” or FDI. That is because, in our view, what was vital was that “foreign investment” should be allowed to flow through convenient instruments to supplement the shortfall in savings and investments in our country’s economic structure, and such inflows need not necessarily have been only via FDI. The move resulted in new and quick inflows, and as a result, debt management became more dynamic and robust. It also provided a new tool to address the wide fluctuation of interest rates that was taking place in the country, prior to the move. This initiative of course necessitated close cooperation and follow up between the MoF and CB, particularly because it resulted in a significant infusion of forex into the country that needed to be properly managed from the point of view of the Central Bank. In retrospect, I can also state that this important move enabled the economy to face the emerging challenging times confidently, with the new inflows assisting the Government to maintain the growth momentum, while also allowing the Central Bank to maintain stability. One of the important lessons that we would take away from this case study is that the initiative was implemented as a result of the close harmonization between the MoF and the Central Bank. Had any one of the two agencies not fully supported this bold and imaginative move, the initiative would have failed, or worse still, been still-born. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Case Study 2: Debut International Sovereign Bond The second case study that I would describe this evening is the debut international sovereign bond of Sri Lanka, in 2007. Mr. Chairman, as you may recollect, by the second half of 2007, the country was fully engaged in the major humanitarian operation, while the global environment was becoming more and more unstable. The local environment was also tense, notwithstanding all efforts. Inflation was high; interest rates were high; the exchange rate was under threat; and the fiscal deficit was expanding rapidly, because of the ever increasing need for finances to fund the massive infrastructure development programme and to meet the costs of the humanitarian operation. To deal with this challenging situation, the MoF and the CB decided that it was vital that a further sizeable injection of long term foreign funds was given to the economy. It was only such an infusion that would allow us to maintain stability, as well as be able to have the much needed funds to keep the infrastructure development effort going. Some financially savvy members of the Opposition too, realized the significance of such a fund infusion into the economy, and tried their utmost to scuttle that effort. But, fortunately, we were able to defeat those endeavours, and raise the all important bond, and tide over the risky period. The infusion of the new funds immediately brought stability to the economy and also acted as an important stimulus for growth, with the new additional resources quickly filtering down into the economy. Hence, as a result of the move, the Fiscal framework was supported with the moderation of interest rates; the monetary framework was facilitated with the stabilization of prices; and exchange rate was supported by the buttressing of international reserves. Mr. Chairman, I believe that, some day when Sri Lanka’s economic history is being written, this 2007 infusion of US$ 500 million through the international sovereign bond, would be marked as a major “turning point” in our economic landscape. I also believe that the benefits of this land mark move has been of an enduring and permanent nature, as evidenced by the fact that, over the next 5 ½ years, the Government has been able to raise a further US$3 ½ billion from international bonds, with the coupon rates tightening considerably each year. Another benefit that this initiative entailed, was that it paved the way for several banks and corporates to also issue international bonds, thereby accessing savings from outside the country. By doing that, we had also been able to bridge the chronic savings/investment gap that has been regularly referred to by a never ending stream of experts since independence, as a major deficiency that was hampering growth in our economy. Case Study 3: Intervention to stabilize a systemically important bank The third case study that I would like to illustrate is the instance where the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance teamed up to stabilize a systemically important bank that was facing a liquidity crisis in late 2008/early 2009. Mr. Chairman, If we take our minds back to that period, in late 2008, we would recollect that the external environment, internationally and locally, had become even more hostile and highly uncertain. Internationally, the global financial crisis had taken a major toll, with hundreds of banks collapsing across the world. Each day, we were hearing about the collapse or the imminent failure of many big names in the global financial landscape. In many countries, the Ministers of Finance and the Governors of the Central Banks were huddled in endless discussions as to what should be done to arrest the crises, or how to stop the bleeding. Businesses were going bankrupt by the thousands. Business confidence level was at rock bottom. People in all parts of the world were in panic. Locally, our humanitarian operation had entered a final and most critical stage, and enormous pressure was being exerted on the economy. In that background, when a systemically important bank showed signs of a liquidity crisis, we knew that such an event, if allowed to escalate, could have dragged our economy to chaos, and our humanitarian operation to a standstill. We had to act decisively, and fast. We could 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  not have delayed responding to this grave threat, or got it wrong. Fortunately, the Central Bank was ready. We had already developed a bank intervention operation, code named “Sigiriya”, to deal with a situation of a liquidity crisis in a bank. The time had come to activate such a mission. But to do so, the first step was vital. That was to apprise the Minister of Finance and obtain his approval to make the intervention. If the Minister of Finance were to approve such an intervention, if would be the first time ever, in Sri Lanka, that such a rescue operation was attempted. At the same time, the experiences of other countries during that period, were not too encouraging. In many countries, including the UK, (as in the case of the Northern Rock Bank), the Finance Ministers and the Governors of the Central Banks had been in protracted discussions for many weeks about this type of intervention, without reaching agreement. Fortunately for Sri Lanka however, such procrastination did not take place. The Minister of Finance was decisive, and after a single “one-on-one” discussion with me, he gave the approval for the Central Bank to proceed with implementation of the intervention plan. The rest is history. The newly appointed directors and the managing agents, with the Central Bank in the background, were able to stabilize the bank within a short period of about 2 weeks. Thereafter, within a few months, the bank was able to infuse new capital and thereby qualify to exit from the close monitoring system of the Central Bank, in less than a year. This episode will be an important lesson for those who wish to study the way Governments and Central Banks should cooperate to bring stability, in the face of any instability in the banking sector. It also confirmed the validity of an important annotation in Exter’s Report. Let me quote once again from the first Chapter of his Report: “Many of its (Central Bank’s) powers may go unused for long periods, because they are designed for particular situations, some of which may never arise. Others are intended for use only in crises or to forestall a crisis, but prudence dictates that they be included now, so that they will be at hand in case of need. …”. Case Study 4: The creation of our present day “virtuous cycle” Mr. Chairman, I would like to now place before you, yet another significant example of harmonization between the Monetary and Fiscal policies, which led to the creation of a new “virtuous cycle” in relation to inflation, interest rates, investor confidence and sustained growth, in our country. As we are all aware, Sri Lanka had been long trapped in a “vicious cycle” of high fiscal deficits leading to high inflation; high inflation leading to high interest rates; high interest rates leading to low investor confidence; low investor confidence leading to sluggish investment; sluggish investment leading to low growth; low growth leading to high debt; and high debt once again leading to high fiscal deficits. This was the vicious cycle that we had been trapped, for more than 5 decades since independence. It is true that we have had one-off spurts of high growth or short periods of low inflation at various times in our history. However, we have to acknowledge that, other than in 2010 and 2011, we have never had over 8% growth in consecutive years, or, for that matter, been even able to record an average growth of over 5% over a 5 year period, prior to 2006! At the same time, other than the period February 2009, till now, Sri Lanka had never enjoyed a period of even two continuous years of single digit inflation, and, believe it or not, our level of average inflation was over 12% prior to that! What was worse was that there was almost a sense of acceptance of such performance among many officials of both the MoF and CB, who harboured the internal view that it may be our country’s “karma” to have low growth, large fiscal deficits and high inflation! In fact, many Central Bank officials were often heard to lament that the continuous high fiscal deficits of the Government was pushing inflation up and grumble that the Government will never stop doing that. In turn, MoF officials used to complain that the tight and in-sensitive monetary policies of the CB was the root cause for the fiscal deficit always being out of control! 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  It was therefore clear that a change in attitude and a change in action was vital. It was also necessary to make some effective interventions to change the equilibrium of this vicious cycle, so that a fresh equilibrium could be created. Le Chatelier, the famous French Scientist who introduced the “Equilibrium Law” to the world in 1898, had taught us that, in order to disturb an equilibrium, you only need to disturb one component of the equilibrium. Then, the entire system will move into a new equilibrium. So, a key decision had to be made, as to which of the offending components of our vicious equilibrium should be disturbed and dealt with first. Towards that end, I remember, having several “one-on-one” discussions with the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera in late 2006 and early 2007, to jointly decide on this all important priority. Based on such discussions, we decided that we would take the necessary initiatives to improve investor confidence so as to ensure the continuous investment via the Government and the local private sector, whilst specifically targeting new foreign investment. Accordingly, many initiatives were implemented, and over a comparatively short period of time, such efforts started showing results, and the country started to record a steady inflow of foreign investment through major government projects, investments in Treasury Bills and Bonds, and investments in international sovereign bonds. This regular flow of investments enabled the economy to record sustained high growth, even whilst the conflict was raging. As a consequence, Sri Lanka recorded an average growth of 6.7% through 2006 to 2012, which was one of the most difficult periods in our history. In fact, the growth levels of 2006: 7.7%, 2007: 6.8%, 2008: 6%, 2009: 3.5%, 2010: 8%, 2011: 8.2%, and 2012: 6.4%, were the highest ever in any seven year period in our history! That meant that our joint strategy had paid off, with sustained growth being recorded. With such sustained growth and with the pipeline of continuous investments, the economy was gradually transformed to a more stable level, and with that, all other key factors in the vicious cycle also began to change for the better. Initially, certain critics did not believe that we would be able to escape from the vicious cycle that had trapped the country for decades. They wrote to the newspapers and gave TV interviews stating that the initial successes were flukes and were not sustainable. They warned that the economy would return to the vicious cycle once again. They continued to support their arguments with many high sounding theories and hair-splitting formulas, and Dr. Jayasundera and I were ridiculed, and often described as the villains responsible for the impending disaster. We were regularly featured in some unflattering, but nevertheless enjoyable cartoons as well! But, today, Mr. Chairman, those critics are finding it increasingly difficult to sustain their criticism, in the face of the gradually emerging new equilibrium of the “virtuous cycle” that our new harmonized policy framework had been able to generate. Presently, even though a minority stubbornly refuse to see what is unfolding before their very own eyes, this new cycle has taken shape: Low inflation leading to real interest rates; real interest rates leading to enhanced savings; enhanced savings leading to a regular pipeline of investment; regular investment leading to lower debt levels; lower debt levels leading to sustained growth; and sustained growth once again leading to low inflation. What that tells us is that we have been able to break free from the previous vicious cycle, and have now placed the country on a more virtuous cycle! The challenge therefore would be to carefully nurture and guard this new equilibrium, knowing fully well that the disturbance in even one of those components could change that situation with adverse results. Case Study 5: The establishment of the Deposit Insurance Scheme Let me now illustrate yet another example of harmonization. This is in relation to the establishment of the Deposit Insurance Fund and Scheme. My colleagues at the Central Bank have told me that discussions in connection with the setting up of a Deposit Insurance Scheme had been taking place at various times, over the past two decades! However, there was no consensus reached on a suitable mechanism, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  particularly because the large initial capital that was required for the establishment of such a scheme, could not be allocated by the Government for many years due to the intense pressure upon the need to allocate funds for other more pressing needs of the state. Nevertheless, it was considered vital that such a fund and a scheme should be established, and hence an innovative method had to be structured, without placing an additional burden upon the Government coffers. In 2010 too, internal discussions were once again taking place with regard to the possible setting up of a Deposit Insurance Fund. At that time, we noted that the abandoned properties of the banks, which constituted the dormant account balances of over 10 years, had risen to a sizeable amount, and according to the law, those funds had to be placed by the banks with the Government for safe keeping. Accordingly, it was then decided by the MoF and the CB to use the funds so placed, as the nucleus of the Deposit Insurance Fund. Thereafter, the regular premia paid by the banks and finance companies, based on a pre-determined formula, could be credited to this new Fund, and thereby, build up the Fund. In order to implement such plan, an arrangement had to be made with the Government, in that, instead of crediting the abandoned property funds to the fiscal coffers of the Government, such funds could be retained by the CB for the purpose of initiating the Deposit Insurance Fund. In that manner, the new deposit insurance fund was created, and as a result, a long felt need was fulfilled! In fact, that scheme was innovatively designed not only to provide for a “pay out” in the event of a financial institution collapsing or being rendered dysfunctional, but also to provide funds for the purpose of reviving and/or restructuring viable financial institutions that face liquidity crisis from time to time. In that context, I am pleased to state that the Monetary Board has recently decided to invest a part of the fund to deal with some of the structural imbalances that have arisen in certain finance companies, so that such an infusion would encourage new investors to take over, revive and restructure such troubled institutions, with greater confidence and certainty. Case Study 6: Stabilization measures of 2012 Mr. Chairman, the next illustration I want to present to you is one of the clearest examples of policy co-ordination between fiscal and monetary policy. That was the stabilization package of 2012, which was introduced by the MoF and the CB from February to April 2012, in response to the pressure on the balance of payments, high imports, high credit growth and pressure on the exchange rate. As we all know, to deal with that growing tension, the Central Bank increased the policy interest rates, allowed the exchange rate to be more flexible and placed a 18% credit ceiling upon banks’ lending. In tandem, the Government imposed higher duties on the import of vehicles and a few other commodities, and increased the administratively determined prices of petroleum products. These measures were implemented in a carefully planned out and logical sequence. As a consequence, the desired stability within the economy was achieved quickly, with the Balance of Payments returning to positive territory, and the exchange rate stabilizing. In fact, this new situation enabled the Monetary Board to relax the monetary policy tightening cycle that commenced in February 2012, as early as in December 2012. This joint exercise therefore shows how quickly and effectively, a coordinated fiscal and monetary policy could deliver results, instead of the implementation of stand-alone monetary or fiscal policies, which usually take a long time to impact the economy, thus resulting in to the entire economy having to suffer from tight policies for longer periods of time. Case study 7: Judicious use of fiscal policies, based on inflation behavior and other macro-economic factors Mr. Chairman, I have so far discussed 6 case studies that confirm the co-operation and harmonization between the MoF and CB. The co-ordination however, went even further and was applied in several other situations as well. Now, I am going to describe one general 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  example out of several similar instances which took place from time to time, over the past few years. Let us take our minds back to October/November 2011. At that time, the global oil prices had soared to dizzy heights, and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was incurring rather heavy losses. As a natural response therefore, an increase in the administrated prices in petroleum products seemed like a sensible action. However, at that time, inflation in the country was around the 7% level. Inflation projections for the next 2 months too, were around the 7% to 8% levels. In that background, our view was that, if the petroleum prices were to be adjusted upwards significantly, the inflation figures would have risen above 10%, and had that happened, the favourable sentiments that had been built up carefully over the previous 33 months would have been badly damaged. Then, we would have had to start our inflation control efforts all over again, and inflation expectations too would have suffered considerably. So, a balance was struck and the decision to increase the petroleum prices was postponed until February 2012, because we knew that, by that time, the inflation figures would be very low, at less than 3%, and that benign situation would then give us a comfortable cushion to make the price adjustment, without harming the inflation numbers or the inflation outlook. This was then, just one, but a representative case study of holding on to a difficult position in the short term, to realize a long term position, so as to benefit by an even more significant outcome. It was, as Exter may have been happy to acknowledge had he been present, a pragmatic decision of the Government working closely with the Central Bank, cooperating on a complex and delicate issue, to deliver stability and growth in the long term. A “shared vision” and “goal congruence” Mr. Chairman, I am often asked by people as to the exact definition of the economic philosophy behind our country’s economic policies. As is usual in any field of learning, academics and scholars like to categorize a series of policies, according to a general character, or to place them in a framework of a pre-determined school of thought. Where then would our current economic policy framework, fit in? Is there a particular model that Sri Lanka follows? To respond to such questions, let us try to understand what exactly our economic planners are doing, and what they are attempting to achieve. In my view and understanding, it is clear as to what our goals are, and I must say, there are quite a few: Maintain a low level of inflation; Consolidate the fiscal deficit on a planned basis; Promote SMEs; Ensure food security; Encourage import substitution; Enhance exports; Diversify our external sector by adding new areas to the external sector; Record a current account surplus by 2016; Deliver balanced regional development; Ensure that infrastructure development takes place in all parts of the country; Improve the way we do business; Consolidate our debt position; Encourage more savings; Eradicate poverty; Reduce unemployment to very low levels; Continuously maintain sufficient levels of foreign reserves; Improve the living standards of all the people. What then would a collection of policies that are designed and are being implemented to deliver the above outcomes, be called? In all humility, I must admit, I don’t know. That perhaps could be for the academics and scholars to propose, debate and decide. But for the time being, let me say that, whatever those policies may be collectively called, we are determined to implement them through a harmonized approach that is designed to take us forward, towards all those vital targets simultaneously. I would also argue that, for such approach to be successful in the long term, we must always retain one of the most important features of our current economic management, which is that the MoF and CB must have a “shared” vision and “shared objectives”. That shared vision has been the platform that has helped the two institutions to achieve “goal congruence” in the recent past, and there is also no doubt that the resulting harmonization has been the powerful driving force behind our steady progress. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 13  In the meantime, we must also appreciate that a large segment of our economic activities are carried out by the private sector, to which many of you belong. Your contribution then, has also been a vital factor in maintaining the momentum and thrust of our economy. Therefore, let me acknowledge today that, no amount of harmonization of Monetary and Fiscal policies could ever be a substitute for the commitment and dedication of a vast number of entrepreneurs who take risks, as well as burn the mid-night oil, to deliver value in our economy. A future role for the accountancy profession Where do we go from here? In my view, Sri Lanka has only just begun an exciting and adventurous journey, and we are steadily moving towards a US$ 100 billion economy that would be more diversified and more stable. Needless to say, the success of our journey would depend to a great extent on harmonized policies, clarity of communication, quick implementation, and the maintenance of a vibrant momentum on a continuous basis. In that context, I see the accounting profession playing an increasingly significant role. I see the Accountants being vital partners in the operationalizing of the 5 major hubs, and in particular, the commercial and knowledge hubs that we are keen to establish in our country. The CAs have expertise in accounting, auditing, taxation, information technology, financial management, banking, planning, financial analysis and project management, among many other skills. The contribution they could make in the new Sri Lanka that is unfolding before us, therefore, is immense. The skills that they possess in finance, planning and business are also varied, and hence they could play a very important role in many spheres of public and private enterprise of our country. I am confident they would respond to that call, and all of you would enhance your role in our country’s economic activities in the future. A finance man as governor? Let me now strike a slightly personal note before I proceed to conclude this address. In order to do so, let me quote from what Exter had to say about the person to be selected as the Governor: “Although the ultimate authority rests in the Monetary Board, the draft law nevertheless recognizes need for a strong chief executive for the Central Bank. Accordingly, the Governor is made the Chairman of the Monetary Board, and is given control of the agenda for its meetings. He is to be responsible for the execution and administration of policies and measures adopted by the Monetary Board, for the direction, supervision and control of the operations of the Central Bank, and for its internal management and administration. He is to be chief representative of the Bank in its relations with outside persons, ….. Accordingly, the Governor should be a man of recognized and outstanding competence in, and understanding of, the economic and financial problems of Ceylon, and of unquestioned integrity and responsibility...” Exter then states, and I quote further: “It is important that the Governor should have had actual financial experience. In many countries this point has actually been incorporated in legislation, as the following quotation from De Kock’s book on Central Banking shows: ‘… in the case of some central banks it has been laid down by statute that the Governor and Deputy-Governor shall be ‘men of proven financial experience’, as in Canada, or ‘persons possessed of actual banking experience’, as in New Zealand, or ‘persons of recognized banking and financial experience’, as in Argentina, or that the Governor shall be a ‘person of tested banking experience’, as in the Union of South Africa and Mexico.’” Mr. Chairman, you may remember when I was first appointed Governor, there were some who claimed that a person with “financial experience”, was not a suitable choice, to undertake the duties of the Governor. While I firmly believe it is up to history to judge as to whether I have been successful or not in discharging my responsibilities as Governor, I also believe that even at this late stage, it may be useful for those critics to reflect on the profile 
14 BIS central bankers’ speeches  that John Exter had in mind for the position of Governor when drafting the MLA, and then perhaps consider, whether or not, I fitted the envisaged profile! In that background, I am inclined to believe that the education, training, and professional skills imparted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, had a major role in my being appointed to this pivotal position as the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Therefore, please permit me to officially and publicly thank the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka for the tremendous impact that the Institute has had on my academic and professional career, in addition to the singular honour you bestowed on me this evening, by inviting me to deliver this prestigious Oration. Conclusion – running between the wickets! Mr. Chairman, let me now conclude, with a little story. About 6 months ago, a journalist friend asked me to explain the official relationship between the Governor and the Secretary, Treasury. In response, I gave him a long lecture for about half an hour, like what I have done today! While listening to me, I could see that he was quite restless, and somewhat bored. So, I was not surprised when he remarked that he was not sure as to how he can explain all what I had said to him, to ordinary people, as my explanation seemed too technical and high-flown. He then told me, “Governor, Can you please explain what you just said to me, in layman’s language?” This was my reply to that challenging question: “To score runs in a cricket match, when one batsman strikes the ball, both batsmen have to run, each to their opposite ends. When the second batsman strikes the ball, once again, both batsmen have to run, each to their opposite ends. That is how the team will be able to accumulate its runs. For an effective partnership to be built, both batsmen have to diligently run for each other’s strikes. In the same way, for an economic partnership of the country to succeed, it is vital that there is a clear understanding between the Governor and the Secretary, Treasury. And, each time the Governor strikes, both the Governor and the Secretary have to run, and when the Secretary strikes, both the Governor and the Secretary have to run once again. That is the type of relationship that has to exist between the Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury.” My journalist friend’s eyes brightened and his boredom vanished. The expression on his face indicated to me that he had finally understood what this complex relationship is all about. Then, he said “Ah, so it’s like running between the wickets!”  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 15  Mr. Chairman, I sincerely hope my address to you today, helped you and everyone here present, to also understand this complex and delicate relationship, in the same manner my friend did! Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Glenn Stevens: Reflections on the global economy and recent economic and financial developments in Australia Opening statement by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Canberra, 18 December 2013. *      *      * Madam Chair Members of the Committee  Thank you for the opportunity to meet with you today. I look forward to constructive engagement with you during the 44th Parliament.  As we reach the close of an eventful year, it is perhaps worth reflecting on some key themes, starting with the global economy. At the meeting with the previous Committee early in the year, we noted several developments. Fears of a euro area break-up had abated. The United States economy was gradually recovering, and the slowdown in China had run its course. These outcomes were roughly as expected, though perhaps of greater significance at that time was the fact that various “downside risks” had not materialised. Global growth was running below average, though not disastrously so. It was thought likely to pick up a bit in 2013.  The period since then has been largely more of the same. The euro area economy contracted in the first part of the year, but may be starting to grow again. It still faces immense challenges with its banks and public finances, and some years of uncertainty. But once again the worst fears have not been realised. The United States continues a path of gradual recovery, despite the budget “sequester” and the divisive debate about the debt ceiling. The recovery is more gradual than policymakers there would like but that often is the nature of things after a financial crisis. China is growing at a solid pace, about in line with policymakers’ announced intentions, despite concerns it might slow more sharply. Global growth was probably about 3 per cent in 2013, just a little less than in 2012. The pick-up expected has not eventuated as yet, though most forecasters still seem to see reasonable prospects of it occurring next year.  So the past year can perhaps be labelled as: not quite good as hoped for, but not as bad as feared.  Looking ahead, the issue that most people are focusing on is the so-called “tapering” of US monetary policy. What is meant by this is that the Federal Reserve is expected, at some point, to moderate the rate at which it buys securities in the market, which is presently US$85 billion per month, and eventually to stop purchases. We don’t know when that process will begin. The Fed has said that it will depend on economic conditions, as obviously it must. Moreover it will only be a step on what is likely to be a fairly long path back towards “normal” monetary policy.  We can be fairly sure, though, that there is ample potential for this shift in direction to reverberate around global markets. That’s what usually occurs when the Fed changes course. The anticipation of this has already been a factor affecting markets, including in particular those in some important “emerging market economies”, at various points this year. It is sensible to assume that this will be the case over the period ahead, as “tapering” begins and as market participants try to ascertain its extent and pace.  Turning to the Australian economy, in February we felt that growth had moderated somewhat and would be below trend for a while, within a range of 2–3 per cent for 2013. Broadly speaking that is what has occurred. Our most recent Statement on Monetary Policy, released 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches in November, put likely GDP growth within that range. The recently released September quarter data don’t cause any material change to that view.  This result reflects quite subdued growth in private domestic demand, partly offset by quite strong growth in exports. The very large run-up in mining investment has reached its peak, while non-mining investment remains at a low ebb, and dwelling investment spending is only in the early stages of an upturn. Consumer spending has been rising, but at a below average pace, as people adjust to slower growth in income and look to contain or reduce debt.  Inflation has remained consistent with the 2–3 per cent target. For the year to December, it looks as though the Consumer Price Index will have risen by about 2½ per cent, with underlying inflation perhaps a little below that. Our assessment is that inflation will remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years.  Looking ahead, resource sector investment will decline – gradually at first but more quickly thereafter. It will most likely fall considerably over the next few years. There is therefore scope for other forms of private demand to grow more quickly, the more so as government spending is scheduled to be subdued. Investment in dwellings shows clear signs of a significant increase, and exports of resources will continue to rise strongly. It is likely that capital spending by firms in some sectors outside the resources sector will eventually pick up, but this will take some time yet and it will be against the backdrop of a challenging environment. Consumer demand is likely to grow at a rate close to that of income. Higher wealth and confidence could see the saving rate decline a little, but consumption will not be the same driver of growth that it was before the financial crisis.  Putting all this together, our expectation is that the below-trend growth in GDP we have seen for a while now will probably continue for a bit longer yet. Over the more medium term, there are good grounds to think that growth can strengthen. Eventually more capital spending will be required in some of those sectors where it is very low at present. The corporate sector in aggregate has high reserves of cash, financial intermediaries and capital markets are willing to lend, and interest rates are low. If the nascent improvement in “confidence” we have seen can be sustained, that will help to achieve better growth. In fact, we could aspire to a period during which growth could be a bit above trend for a while, since spare capacity in the economy has increased a bit over the past eighteen months or so. Monetary policy has been playing its part to support demand. Because inflation has been consistent with the target, the Board has been quite comfortable in easing policy by a significant amount. The cash rate has been reduced twice more since we last met with the Committee, and by a total of 225 basis points over the past two years. Borrowing rates are at their lowest levels in a long time. The returns to savers for holding safe assets have commensurately declined, and this has clearly prompted substitution towards other assets, including equities and dwellings. The rate of credit growth has remained quite low thus far, though it is now increasing a little, as housing loan approvals have moved up quite noticeably over recent months. Low interest rates are doing the sorts of things we expect them to do. This is the way expansionary monetary policy works.  The exchange rate has also behaved, of late, more as might be expected in such circumstances: that is, it has declined. From about US$1.03 at the February hearing, it has fallen by about 13 per cent. The Bank has described the exchange rate as “uncomfortably high”, and suggested that balanced growth in the economy would probably require a lower exchange rate.  The Board has maintained an open mind about whether we may need to lower interest rates further. At this point, however, there are few serious claims that the cost of borrowing per se is holding back growth. On the contrary, monetary policy is supporting higher spending by altering incentives as between spending and saving, and working to create an environment in asset and credit markets that eases the restraints on some sorts of activity.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 In the end, though, firms and individuals have to have the confidence to take advantage of that situation. They have to be willing to take a risk – on a new project, a new product, a new market, a new worker. Monetary policy can’t force spending to occur.  That is why the conduct of other policies is also important. The myriad things which can make it harder or easier for businesses to innovate, to change their ways of doing things, to avoid unnecessary costs and to be more productive, all matter. No single one is decisive in itself; but collectively, they are crucial. It is hard to escape the feeling that we as a society have tended, for quite a long time now, to go about our decisions on such matters while making the assumption, perhaps without realising it, that solid growth of the economy will simply continue, and that it won’t be affected by these other choices of various kinds. We are at a moment now when that assumption has to be questioned.  The path of pro-growth, pro-productivity, confidence-building reforms would mean that the basis for investment and growth in real incomes would improve. That would allow consumption to grow without recourse to excessive borrowing. It would provide a revenue base for governments to provide the services and infrastructure the community needs. And so on.  The alternative path is a much less attractive one.  Before I conclude, a few words on payments and regulatory matters. As I mentioned at the February hearing the Payments System Board has been working to encourage industry to put in place the infrastructure to make real-time payments capability for the community a reality over the next few years. Good progress has been made, though there is a long way to go. An early milestone was reached a few weeks ago when the settlement of direct entry payments, amounting to about $50 billion per day, moved to same-day settlement, as opposed to the previous practice of settling the next day. Quite substantial changes to operational arrangements in the private sector, and in the Reserve Bank itself, were required to achieve this. But it was worth doing because it lowers risk in the system and helps faster access to funds.  On financial regulation, the global effort at building a stronger framework continues. The Financial Stability Board has been clear about the priorities over the coming year, under the headings of implementation of Basel III changes, continuing towards completion of a regime for “too big to fail” financial institutions, making derivatives markets safer and making sure “shadow banking” activities have appropriate oversight. Australia, as chair of the G20 this year, welcomes this prioritisation and has indicated that it supports the FSB as it seeks to achieve concrete results by the time of the Leaders’ meeting in Brisbane next November. Australian regulatory authorities continue, meanwhile, carefully to implement internationally agreed reforms, with due regard to local conditions.  With those remarks, Chair, we are here to respond to your questions. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mark Carney: Polymer banknotes Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Bank of England, London, 18 December 2013. *      *      * Ensuring public trust and confidence in money is at the heart of what central banks do. Money can only play its invaluable role in our economy if that trust and confidence is maintained. That motivates the Bank of England’s core objectives of price stability, so that people can be confident of the value of their money over time, and financial stability so that they will be able to access and use money when they want to.  It is also why we place such importance on maintaining confidence in our banknotes, the most tangible form of money. Our job is to ensure that the banknotes people use are high quality and genuine. We also recognise that banknotes are an important national symbol and a source of national pride.  Our banknotes must therefore be secure from counterfeiting, resistant to damage, and designed in a way that inspires broad public support and fosters legitimacy. We are continually working to ensure that our notes meet those requirements.  That is why I am pleased to announce today that the next Bank of England notes will be printed on polymer, rather than cotton paper. The first polymer note will be the £5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill, and will be issued in 2016. It will be followed around a year later by a polymer £10 note featuring Jane Austen. The decision to move to polymer for these notes follows a three-year review and a broad public consultation exercise. Our research has shown a compelling case for polymer notes.  Polymer notes bring three main benefits:  • They stay cleaner than paper banknotes because they are resistant to dirt and moisture;  • They are more secure because they incorporate advanced security features that make them difficult to counterfeit;  • And they are more durable, lasting at least 2½ times as long as paper banknotes, ensuring that notes in circulation remain of high quality. Because replacements are needed less often they are both cheaper over time, and more environmentally friendly.  These advantages mean that a switch to polymer is a natural step in the evolution of banknote design. But you don’t have to take our word for it. Nearly 13000 people have told us what they thought, in surveys and at over 40 events up and down the UK, and 87% – the vast majority – were in favour of polymer notes, especially once they had a chance to see and handle prototype notes.  After that public consultation, we’re confident that the switch to polymer will have broad public support.  For those who might be concerned about the change, let me reassure you that the new polymer notes will retain the familiar look of Bank of England banknotes, including of course the portrait of Her Majesty the Queen, as well as depictions of historical characters of national significance. That continuity of design helps explain why people who have had a chance to handle specimen notes were even more likely to view polymer favourably.  The depiction of historical characters will remain an integral feature of our banknotes, providing an opportunity to celebrate individuals that have shaped the United Kingdom. In 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  order to ensure public confidence in banknotes, it is essential that the choice of characters commands broad public respect and legitimacy.  That is why in July, at the same time as announcing that Jane Austen would feature on the new £10 note, I promised that we would review the way in which the characters featured on banknotes are selected. Today we are announcing a new set of principles to guide the choice of characters and a new process to ensure that those principles are, and are seen to be, followed.  The new principles for character selection state clearly and positively the Bank’s aims in using historic characters on our notes. They put diversity and inclusivity at the heart of the selection criteria. And they make clear our intention to portray a diverse range of characters over time, with each new decision taking into account previous choices.  The new process will be open, transparent and inclusive. There will be greater input from the public and from external experts in the form of a new Advisory Committee with a majority of independent members. That body will recommend a broad theme – for example scientific achievement – before the public are invited to nominate characters within that theme. The Advisory Committee, with input from public focus groups, will narrow down the field to a final shortlist of characters and the Governor will make the final choice from that shortlist.  These changes will ensure that the characters on our banknotes are fully representative of the history and diversity of this great nation, while having the necessary public respect and legitimacy.  Our polymer notes will combine the best of progress and tradition. They will be more secure from counterfeiting and more resistant to damage while celebrating the history and tradition that is important both to the Bank and the nation as a whole.  By consulting widely on the switch to polymer, and by putting in place a new process for selecting banknote characters with much more public input, we have reinforced the commitment to openness and transparency which lies at the heart of the Bank of England’s commitment to accountability.  Together, these announcements ensure that our banknotes will remain both a national symbol and a source of national pride. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benno Ndulu: Addressing the challenges of financial inclusion in Tanzania Welcome and opening remarks by Mr Benno Ndulu, Governor of the Bank of Tanzania, at the official launch of the National Financial Inclusion Framework, Dar Es Salaam, 12 December 2013. *      *      * Your Excellency, Dr. Mohamed Gharib Bilal, Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania; Your Majesty, Queen Máxima of the Netherlands; Honorable Ministers of Agriculture Eng. Christopher Chiza and Minister for Finance Ms. Saada Mkuya, Your Excellency Ambassador of Netherlands to Tanzania; Ms. Ertharin Cousin, Executive Director, World Food Program (WFP), Maria Helena Semodo, Deputy Director General, FAO Mr. Adolfo Brizzi, Director, Policy and Technical Assistance, IFAD Dr. Alfred Hannig, Executive Director Alliance for Financial Inclusion, Heads of the UN Agencies Members of the Diplomatic Corps; Permanent Secretaries; Deputy Governors; Chief Executive Officers; Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen: I am greatly pleased to welcome you all to this important event to officially launch the Tanzania National Financial Inclusion Framework. Please accept my profound appreciation for accepting our invitation to attend this event. In particular, I would like to thank your Excellency, Dr. Mohamed Gharib Bilal, the Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania, for finding the time to grace and open this occasion. Special gratitute to your Majesty, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands who is the UN Secretary General’s Special Advocate for Financial Inclusion for accepting to be the guest of honor to this event. I wish to recognize a great friend of financial inclusion Dr. Alfred Hannig, the Executive Director of Alliance for Financial Inclusion who has helped to establish and grow an initiative that has enabled to engender not only global peer learning but also peer pressure to achieve ambitious targets. Also for special recognition are the three guests, Executive Director of World Food Program (WFP), Ms. Ertharin Cousin, Deputy Director General, Ms. Maria Helena Semedo Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Director, Policy and Technical Advisory Division of International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) Mr. Adolfo Brizzi. Your Excellency, Your Majesty, Ladies and Gentlemen: The Framework has been developed through an elaborate process that involved all key financial inclusion stakeholders in the country with special support from Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT); I thank FSDT for extended cooperation and assistance. We have together as stakeholders identified barriers to financial inclusion and their corresponding core enablers that will be implemented in a coordinated manner to overcome the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  barriers. These have been put together in the document that you will today witness its launch. Financial stakeholders realized that financial inclusion couldn’t be achieved with everyone working in silos. Rather it requires a concerted cooperative approach that will be used to address the challenges of financial inclusion in Tanzania systematically and in a coordinated manner. Ladies and Gentlemen: Financial inclusion is important to the economy, it enables improving the welfare of the poor, – contribute to financial stability; and to growth of micro-business that ultimately stimulate growth of other sectors in the economy. Tanzania has made significant strides to enhance the proportion of adult population who are formally included (adults with accounts in formal financial institutions). In 2006 the proportion stood at 9%, 12% in 2009 and in 2012 it was 17%, or 22% formal inclusion if we include SACCOS. Cognizance of this low rate of formal financial inclusion, we identified a number of barriers that account for such state of affairs. These include: supply side barriers ranging from, high interest rates, services that don’t meet demand side needs, costs, to inefficiencies of service delivery. Demand side barriers include, information asymmetry, irregular income patterns, and financial literacy. Structural and regulatory barriers include, stringent or lack of proportionate requirements for client on-boarding, lack of regulatory framework for broad based micro-finance services, lack of centralized national identification system to mention but a few. Ladies and Gentlemen: In order to build impetus and push for acceleration of financial inclusion we made an international commitment under the AFI auspices (the Maya Declaration) to increase formal access of financial services to 50% by 2015. The AFI network, that has more than 100 countries’ regulators and policy makers as its members, has enabled us to gain knowledge in financial inclusion through peer-learning and peer-pressure. It has also enabled us to host international forums for the establishment of Africa Mobile Phone Financial Service Policy Initiative (AMPI) in February 2013 in Zanzibar. AMPI has been instrumental as a platform to share experiences on how countries in Africa may scale up the use of mobile money for financial inclusion. Tanzania has been used as one of the success stories in using mobile telephony to deliver financial services. And we have already hosted some central banks in attachments to learn from our experiences of taking advantage of leveraging on the use of this mobile technology as a platform to facilitate payment services to the majority of the population far and wide, including those that were hitherto underserved or unbanked. The mobile financial services operated by non-banks and banks has now enabled by September 2013, 90% of the adult population in Tanzania to have access to a mobile money accounts with 43% (or 9.8 Million) adults being active users. Most of these, however, are still unbanked. Although mobile telephony financial service has its limitations as it is still widely used for payment based services only, current initiatives are being deployed to expand its use as a platform to deliver other financial products from mainstream banking. Ladies and Gentlemen: Overall, the level of access to formal financial inclusion in Tanzania is relatively low. According to 2012 World Bank survey 24% of adults in Africa have an account at a formal financial institution as of 2012. As pointed out earlier, in Tanzania 17% of adults have accounts with a formal financial institution. In 2006 this proportion was significantly lower at 9%. Including SACCOS this proportion in Tanzania rises to 22%. The provision of SME and Agribusiness finance likewise has been lower than necessary to support significant growth in this important sector of the economy. Based on National Baseline Survey Report (2012) only 10.6 % of MSMEs have access to finance from 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  formal institutions. And based on AgFims Tanzania Headline Findings (2011) 32.4% of agri-businesses have access to formal credit. We believe that strategies to address challenges behind these low levels of financial inclusion are articulated in the National Financial Inclusion Framework that will be launched today. In preparing this framework we have the advice and challenges that His Excellency Dr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, the President of United Republic of Tanzania raised in Arusha in November 2012 in the Conference for Financial Institutions and in Dar es Salaam in July 2013 at the Smart Partnership Global Dialogue. In both events, financial inclusion was the central theme; and the President challenged us to increase the level of financial inclusion within the shortest time possible. This Framework is the results of that advice and we are pleased that Her Majesty and His Excellency the Vice President are here to witness its launch. Your Excellency, Your Majesty; Ladies and Gentlemen: The Framework is a commitment voice from financial inclusion stakeholders in Tanzania from the private and public sector, who are here present today. They have documented the barriers and key core enablers to be implemented with the objective of spurringfinancial inclusion in Tanzania. An Action Plan that articulates key priority areas will be implemented by each stakeholder. The priorities areas for implementation include: • Proximity: Enhancing and implementing access channels, such as Agent banking, mobile telephony financial services, point of sales, stand alone ATMs, POS and a regulatory framework that creates conducive environment for growth of financial inclusion; • Robust Electronic Platforms: Improving, developing ICT payment platforms that facilitate cost effective and secure access to financial services; • Robust information and easy client on-boarding: Implementing, monitoring and enhancing use of credit bureaus, proportionate Know Your Customer requirements and improved ID system that is linked to financial systems; and • Informed customers and consumer protection: Implement financial consumer protection mechanism and national financial education framework. Your Excellency, Your Majesty; Ladies and Gentlemen: In order to ensure that we achieve results, the Framework has set targets for financial access of 50% by 2016, echoing our international commitment that we made in Riviera Maya, Mexico in 2011 under the AFI initiative-Maya Declaration. Specific targets are also made for specific core enablers that stakeholders are required to implement and achieve within a span of 3 years from today. It is worth noting that some barriers are planned to be addressed within six months from the launch of the Framework, while others are being addressed as I speak for example the regulatory frameworks for the cyber laws and national payment systems law. The Framework also provides an elaborate measurement mechanism that will be used in the assessment of the level of financial inclusion in Tanzania. Based on an all encompassing working definition of financial inclusion key indicators that include usage of financial services have been developed. This is important to ensure that the efforts that stakeholders are making towards implementing the Action Plan have an impact on the ground. Your Majesty, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: A coordinating structure is also established to oversee and supervise the implementation process; where an apex organ: the Financial Inclusion National Council comprising eleven member institutions, from various ministries at Permanent Secretary level and heads of other financial regulatory authorities. This National Council has responsibilities of 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  ensuring that stakeholders implement the Action Plan as articulated in the Framework. The coordinating structure upholds accountability and applies tools such as periodic reporting and assessments. An Impact Assessment will also be conducted after the 3 years target: mid- term review shall be conducted to assess impact of the interventions of the financial inclusion initiatives included in the Framework and inform the National Council on the appropriate directives to issue to the key stakeholders for implementation. Your Excellency, Your Majesty; Ladies and Gentlemen: Development of the Framework has been a very fruitful process; we have witnessed, from the members of the Council and other national technical committees, great enthusiasm, commitment, energy and desire to increase the level of financial inclusion in Tanzania. We therefore expect that the official launch of the Framework shall build more impetus to fulfill our objective of improving the level of financial inclusion in Tanzania. With this remarks, I now have the honor to welcome Honorable, Ms. Saada Mkuya, Acting Minister for Finance to deliver her remarks and welcome His Excellency, Dr. Mohamed Gharib Bilal, the Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania, to deliver his opening speech and thereafter welcome the guest of honor her Majesty Queen Máxima of the Netherlands to deliver the keynote address. Honorable Minister; Ms. Saada Mkuya, welcome. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Guy Debelle: Remarks on liquidity Address by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australasian Finance and Banking Conference, Sydney, 17 December 2013. *      *      * Thank you to Fari for again organising a good conference. Today I will make a few points about liquidity. I have spoken about this on a number of other occasions, but one year out from the Basel III liquidity regime becoming fully operational, it is timely to do so again.1  Why do we have liquidity regulation? The fundamental answer is that banks engage in maturity transformation. They borrow short and lend long. This is a service which society values. There is a demand for banks to provide liquidity services. Depositors place their savings with a bank but want to be able to withdraw some part of their funds at short notice. A corporate treasurer wants to have the company’s funds in an account where they can be accessed quickly to meet the needs of the firm. At the same time, we prefer to have our loans for substantially longer periods of time. It would be particularly inefficient and bothersome if we had to renegotiate our home loan on a monthly basis. More importantly, it would be very difficult to make any sort of long-term planning or investment decision if there were no long-term loans available. This desire for liquidity on the one hand and long-term lending on the other is intermediated by the financial sector and the banking sector in particular. But the maturity transformation this entails exposes the banking sector to liquidity risk. If all the depositors wanted their money back in a hurry, the bank would not be able to meet that obligation without either calling in their loans, which may be contractually impossible, or trying to sell them. The latter is often practically impossible to do at short notice, or even if it is possible, may only be able to be carried out by selling the assets (such as loan portfolios) at fire-sale prices. Neither of those outcomes is socially desirable. Fire sales run the risk of generating contagion to other financial institutions as the price of the asset falls, as they may well hold that same asset too, and/or may use it as collateral in transactions themselves. Fire sales also limit the ability of the institution making the sale to make good on its obligations. So there are externalities to the asset that is being sold, as well as to the financial system as a whole. Liquidity regulation addresses this issue by ensuring that the banking system has some level of liquidity at hand to meet predictable liquidity demands. In the case of Basel III, banks need to have available sufficient liquidity to meet a 30-day stress scenario. In simple terms, a bank must have enough liquid assets that can be easily liquefied (not at fire-sale prices) to meet any of its liabilities that fall due within that 30-day period. In Basel III, these assets are labelled high-quality liquid assets (HQLA).                                                  1 See Debelle G (2013), “The Impact of Payments System and Prudential Reforms on the RBA’s Provision of Liquidity”, Address to the Australian Financial Markets Association and Reserve Bank of Australia Briefing, Sydney, 16 August.

2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  This implies that more liquid liabilities, those with less than 30 days to maturity, will be more costly for the bank to provide. Hence, one would expect to see an increase in the cost to the customer of obtaining that liquidity service. We have seen this start to occur in Australia as the implementation date of Basel III, 1 January 2015, comes into sight. But my sense is that there is more of this repricing still to come. As I have said before, the rate of return available on at-call accounts does not seem to sufficiently reflect the cost to the bank of providing such liquidity. Maybe we will have to wait for 31 December 2014 for this to occur, as there is potentially a large first-mover disadvantage from being the first to reprice the product. The lower interest rate is likely to see customers move rapidly to a competitor who has yet to reprice. In the online account world, the transactions costs of switching are very low, and the evidence is that the response rate to small interest rate differentials is rapid. While there may be more repricing to come, it is worth mentioning that as part of the Basel III liquidity standards, banks are required to demonstrate to APRA that they have an appropriate liquidity transfer pricing model. APRA is conducting a trial run of the new liquidity regime over the coming year and one might expect these new liquidity pricing models to come into effect as part of that. This will affect not just deposit pricing but pricing on the other side of the balance sheet, namely loans, as well. It will have a particular impact on contingent facilities such as lines of credit. To return to the issue of HQLA for a minute. As most of you are aware, there is a shortage of HQLA in Australia. The stock of government debt on issue, both Commonwealth and state, is well short of the liquidity needs of the banking system. Hence, as part of the liquidity regime, the Reserve Bank will be offering banks access to a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF). For a fee, the Reserve Bank will make available sufficient liquidity (against eligible collateral) to address the shortfall of HQLA beyond the banking system’s holdings of Commonwealth and state government debt. The motivation for doing so reflects the societal gains that I talked about earlier from the banking system engaging in an appropriate amount of maturity transformation. The pricing of the CLF is aimed at replicating the cost of holding HQLA in the form of government debt. That is, it is designed to be the same as the liquidity premium embedded in government paper. The fact that there is a cost to the banking system of holding HQLA, either in the form of government debt or in the fee paid to have access to the CLF, is in keeping with one of the main motivations of the Basel III liquidity regime, namely that banks engage in the appropriate amount of maturity transformation. Generally speaking, liquidity was underpriced prior to 2007 with the result that excessive maturity transformation was undertaken, manifest in some cases in highly unstable short-term funding structures. The new liquidity regulation increases the cost of liquidity, but it is not designed to increase the cost so much that insufficient maturity transformation is undertaken from society’s point of view. Having talked about liquidity from the banking system’s point of view, I will finish with a few thoughts on liquidity in the superannuation (pension) system. In many ways, liquidity issues in the super sector are very similar to those in the banking sector. While the super sector generally thinks of itself as being in the asset management business, it is obviously very much in the intermediation business. It takes in savings and then invests them in a wide array of assets. Because of the portability of super accounts as well as the ability of superannuants to change their asset allocation at relatively short notice, the super sector is also in the business of maturity transformation. Some, potentially unknown, share of its liabilities may be called on at short notice. But some of its assets are long-dated and not easily liquefied at short notice, or if they can be, only at fire-sale prices. As with banks, society values the maturity transformation that the super sector undertakes, particularly in terms of the funds it provides for longer-lived projects. But as with the banking system, there is an optimal degree of maturity transformation and an optimal amount of liquidity to be held. It is desirable that super funds don’t hold all their assets in highly liquid 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  form for the fear that all of its members may withdraw their funds all at once, just as banks don’t put all their assets in liquid form for the fear that a bank run might occur. But at the same time, it is not desirable for all of a super fund’s assets to be invested in highly illiquid assets. To some extent, the super sector’s relatively large allocation to equities, which are, in principle, easily liquefied, but relatively small allocation to fixed income, which is not easily liquefied, may reflect some of these liquidity considerations. But at the heart of it, these liquidity management issues are very similar to those facing a bank. I think many of the principles of liquidity management translate from the banking sector to the super sector, although I have the sense that this is not yet fully appreciated.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ben S Bernanke: Opening remarks at the Ceremony commemorating the Centennial of the Federal Reserve Act Opening remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Ceremony commemorating the Centennial of the Federal Reserve Act, Washington DC, 16 December 2013. *      *      * Paul and Alan have me at a disadvantage. Each of us was asked to reflect on our own term in office. But they have the benefit of perspective, whereas my term still has a short time to run. Moreover, work on some of the Federal Reserve’s most important challenges of the past few years – notably, achieving a full economic recovery from the crisis and putting in place a new financial regulatory system – is still ongoing. Nonetheless, I will offer a few thoughts on the past very eventful eight years.  The Federal Reserve’s extraordinary response to the financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed was, in one sense, nothing new. We did what central banks have done for many years and what they were designed to do: We served as a source of liquidity and stability in financial markets, and, in the broader economy, we worked to foster economic recovery and price stability. However, in another sense, what we did was very new – it was unprecedented in both scale and scope, and it made use of a number of tools that were new, or at least not part of the standard central bank toolkit. We found that these new tools were necessary if we were to fulfill the classic functions of a central bank in the context of a 21st century economic and financial environment.  When the financial system teetered near collapse in 2008 and 2009, we responded as the 19th century British essayist Walter Bagehot advised, by serving as liquidity provider of last resort to stressed financial firms and markets.1 But we did so in an institutional environment that was very different, and in many ways much more complex, than the one that Bagehot knew. For example, the recent crisis involved runs on financial institutions, as occurred in classic panics. But in 2008, rather than a run of retail bank deposits, the runs occurred in various forms of short-term, uninsured wholesale funding, such as commercial paper and repurchase agreements. Moreover, although commercial banks suffered large losses and some came under significant pressure, the crisis hit particularly hard those nonbank institutions most dependent on wholesale funding, such as investment banks and securitization vehicles. Thus, the Fed lent not only to commercial banks, but also extended its liquidity facilities to critical nonbank institutions and key financial markets, such as the commercial paper market. To minimize the risk of strains abroad feeding back on U.S. dollar funding markets, the Fed also coordinated with foreign central banks to create a network of currency swap lines.  Beyond the provision of liquidity, the Fed worked with other agencies both here and abroad to help restore public confidence in the financial system. Notably, we led the development of stress-testing large banking organizations’ capital adequacy. The first stress tests, in 2009, and the public disclosure of their results made it possible for large U.S. banks to once again attract private capital. Since 2009, the stress tests and disclosures, together with other regulatory and supervisory actions, have contributed to a doubling in capital held by the largest U.S. financial institutions and the resumption of more-normal flows of credit.  The Fed has also worked to draw the appropriate lessons from the crisis and to take the steps necessary to help avoid a similar event in the future. As those assembled here well know, the                                                  1  See Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches deliberations that led to the founding of the Federal Reserve were precipitated by a financial panic, the Panic of 1907. The preservation of financial stability was consequently a principal goal of the creators of the new central bank. In response to the Panic of 2008, the Federal Reserve has returned to its roots by restoring financial stability as a central objective alongside the traditional goals of monetary policy. We have refocused our supervision of financial institutions to take a more “macroprudential” approach that fosters systemic stability as well as the stability of individual institutions. We also more extensively monitor the financial system as a whole and, in cooperation with other agencies, have put in place stronger oversight of systemically important financial firms, including higher capital and liquidity requirements, tougher supervision, and a process for the orderly resolution of failed firms.  We have also had to be innovative in finding ways to use monetary policy to help the economy recover from the deep recession that followed the crisis. Providing adequate monetary accommodation has not been a straightforward task because our principal monetary policy tool, the target for the federal funds rate, has been stuck near zero since the end of 2008. Consequently, we’ve had to find other ways to bring monetary policy to bear, notably including techniques designed to influence longer-term interest rates. For instance, the Fed, like several other central banks, has purchased longer-term securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, help ease financial conditions, and promote a stronger recovery.  A significant aspect of finding innovative ways to execute our duties as a central bank in a new, more complex environment has been the ongoing revolution in communication and transparency. Part of that effort has involved formally defining our goals under the mandate for maximum employment and price stability given to us by the Congress. Two years ago, we established 2 percent as our inflation goal, and we regularly communicate policymakers’ views of the level of unemployment expected to correspond to maximum sustainable employment over time. Additionally, our monetary policy has come to rely more heavily on “forward guidance.” With our short-term policy rate about as low as it can practicably go, we have sought to ease financial conditions further and provide additional impetus to the recovery by communicating both quantitatively about the likely future path of our policy rate and qualitatively about the likely evolution of our balance sheet. Other central banks around the world have met the challenge of current conditions with similar innovations. And I would be remiss if I did not point out, especially with Paul and Alan here, that the Fed’s recent communications innovations owe a great deal to developments like the monetary targeting framework devised under Chairman Volcker and the post-Federal Open Market Committee statement and qualitative forward guidance introduced under Chairman Greenspan.  In summary, the financial crisis that the Fed confronted five years ago was in many ways analogous to the panics that central banks have faced for centuries. But, at the same time, the crisis and the deep recession that followed occurred in an economic and financial environment that was certainly different, and in many ways more complex, than in the past. The Federal Reserve found ways to carry out its traditional central bank functions in this environment, and we are working with other policymakers, domestically and internationally, to put in place a strengthened regulatory framework that will help preserve stability in the face of the complexity, interconnectedness, and innovation in our modern financial system.  One of my personal objectives since I became Chairman has been to increase the transparency of the Fed – to more clearly explain how our policies are intended to work and the thinking behind our decisions. As I already noted, improved communication can help our policies work better, whether through the disclosure of bank stress-test results or by helping the public and market participants better understand how monetary policy is likely to evolve. Ultimately, however, the most important reason for transparency and clear communication is to help ensure the accountability of our independent institution to the American people and their elected representatives. Clarity, transparency, and accountability help build public confidence in the Federal Reserve, which is essential if it is to be successful in fostering stability and prosperity.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Fabio Panetta: SEPA and its repercussions for Italy’s payment system Welcoming address by Mr Fabio Panetta, Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy, at the SEPA Conference, organized by the Bank of Italy, Rome, 9 December 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank all the authorities, market players, associations and analysts for taking part in today’s meeting.  SEPA plays a key role in the completion of the European financial system, by ensuring the provision of innovative, reliable and affordable payment services to market players and users. National and European authorities, the banking and financial sector, trade and consumer associations, and the public sector are all involved in the project. The Bank of Italy has committed resources and energies to drive this innovation forward.  SEPA plays a major role in European integration, involving as it does a myriad of stakeholders representing very different activities, interests and levels of technological development. The objective is not just to introduce new payment schemes and new procedures, for the project will also bring about positive changes in the habits of European citizens and in the organization and work methods of banks, firms and the public sector.  Although considerable progress has been made in recent months, much remains to be done. The project must continue to advance apace, if necessary with a sharp spurt in the last furlong, which will probably also be the most arduous. The work already completed and the results achieved to date justify a cautious optimism in view of the end date of 1 February 2014.  The SEPA is important on two levels: it heightens integration and competition in the retail payment market and it fosters an efficient and reliable payment system. These objectives are shared by the authorities and business milieus.  The structure of the project, its aims and benefits are clearly and exhaustively described in the publication the Bank has distributed today;1 the areas covered range from the standardization of credit transfers and direct debits to the adoption of harmonized schemes for payment cards. The technical solutions adopted in the past at the national level are being adapted to the new SEPA framework within clearly defined limits in order to avoid perpetuating the fragmentation among member states.  The context in which SEPA operates is based on two key elements for the evolution of the payment system: legislation and technology.  Harmonized European legislation on payments, centred around the Payment Services Directive (PSD), is fundamental for the success of SEPA. The proposed new Directive, PSD2, will further converge national legislation and boost competition in the market for payment services, improving the transparency and reliability of the products offered to firms and the public.  By standardizing the payment instruments made available by SEPA and employing advanced technology for e-commerce and mobile and Internet communications it will be possible to create a more modern payment market, in line with European and Italian policies to increase the spread of information technology.  SEPA will bring substantial benefits to all concerned. Firms will be able to make and receive payments via a single account at any European bank. Using the ISO standard, which can be                                                  1 See “La SEPA e i suoi riflessi sul sistema dei pagamenti italiano”, Tematiche istituzionali, Banca d’Italia, November 2013 (http://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/temist/sepa-riflessi-sistema-pagamenti/testo.pdf). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches integrated with banks’ own management software, will foster innovation in several ways, from integrating the collection process to rationalizing accounting procedures. There will be significant advantages for small firms as well.  SEPA will also facilitate the use of Internet and innovative communication systems such as tablets and smartphones, offering consumers flexibility in the use of different means of payment at low costs. Users’ payments and collections with firms and the public sector will improve with the use of electronic instruments.  From the banks’ point of view, retail payment services not only account for a large part of total expenditure and revenue,2 but they are an important route to customer loyalty through the provision of high-quality services at affordable prices. Although European market integration may entail a loss of position in the very short term, in a longer perspective it will enlarge the potential supply and open the way for advanced technology products. Similar benefits await non-bank providers of payment services and managers of retail payment systems who are called on to create a Europe-wide network.  I would like to make a final comment on the importance of SEPA for Italy. Non-cash means of payment are used less in our country than elsewhere in Europe. Paper-based payment instruments are still widely employed, although they are more costly for issuers and less secure for users.  The characteristics of the Italian market and the payment habits of the population reflect the structural characteristics of the productive system, such as the limited use of more advanced means of communication, the small average size of commercial firms, and the rigidity in the supply of innovative services. In many areas of the country this backwardness is aggravated by the size of the underground economy and in some cases by widespread illegality.  Modernizing Italy’s payment system and integrating it in the wider European market will bring benefits far beyond those directly deriving from the introduction of new instruments and new technical standards. The changes now under way, boosted by SEPA, will bring clarity and transparency to business relations throughout the 4  economy and not just in the payment sector. Market players will be encouraged to revise their organization and code of conduct. The public sector will have the tools and procedures they need to improve payment transactions with firms and the public. In this way, the creation of a modern, competitive and reliable payment system in Italy will help to build a more efficient and transparent productive system.  In the 1990s, following the recommendations of the White Paper on Payment Systems in Italy, we successfully undertook a broad reform of interbank settlement procedures to bring the country into line with the most advanced European standards. Today, we must take the opportunity offered by SEPA to improve the supply of payment services in Italy, with benefits for the public, firms and the public sector.  This is the route we should follow. I hope that this conference will yield suggestions, observations and ideas for mapping the future development of Italy’s payment system as part of the broader growth and modernization of Italy in Europe.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Pentti Hakkarainen: Banking union – where do we stand in the Single Supervisory Mechanism? Key talking points by Mr Pentti Hakkarainen, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the working luncheon of the EU Ambassadors, Bank of Finland, Helsinki, 12 December 2013. *      *      * Accompanying slides can be found on the Bank of Finlands’ website: Slides (PDF). We have experienced a series of different types of crises since 2008. Each of them has had devastating effects on the real economy. What have we learnt? The crises have made it very clear that a highly interconnected financial sector requires a stronger institutional framework than what we currently have. A problem at one bank can quickly spread to other ones both at home and beyond national borders with damaging effects on the real economy and taxpayers. The financial crisis led to a sudden stop of capital flows within Europe, as banks withdrew from foreign operations and financial integration took serious setbacks. By 2010, it became desperately evident that the bank and sovereign risks are tightly interconnected with two-way causality. The key lesson we have learnt is that financial crises have devastating effects on the real economy, taxpayers and the whole society. Recovery from a crisis is always painfully slow and long-lasting. Financial trilemma All in all, the mismatch between the scope of international bank operations and the national supervisory framework made the situation extremely challenging. With the overarching objective of financial stability in mind, the situation can be described as “financial trilemma”, as Dirk Schoenmaker has proposed.1 In principle, you can envisage three solutions to the financial trilemma. First of all, we could re-nationalize the financial markets. In such a solution, the single market as well as the single currency and single monetary policy would be lost. Second, we could just accept the risk of financial instability. Or finally, we could work to create a banking union, with single supervision and resolution. Only the last one of these is acceptable. Institutional arrangements for supervision and resolution need to match the integrated structures of banking business in the real world. Banking Union In June 2012, EU leaders agreed to deepen economic and monetary union as a remedy for the crisis, including creating a true Banking Union. The Single Rulebook provides a foundation for the Banking Union. It is based on the idea of identical regulatory requirements, such as capital adequacy rules for banks. These are achieved through European legislation and lower-level provisions, such as binding standards developed by the European Banking Authority. The rulebook leaves, however, some leeway for national authorities to impose stricter requirements at the national level for macro-prudential reasons, such as containing real-estate bubbles. The greatest progress has been achieved in the field of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. In November, an EU regulation came into effect assigning supervisory competencies to the                                                 1  Dirk Schoenmaker (2011) “The financial trilemma”, Economics Letters 111, 57–59. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  European Central Bank (ECB). When the ECB will assume its supervisory tasks next year, it will have two clearly separated functions – monetary policy and banking supervision. Another important pillar of the banking union is the Single Resolution Mechanism. As you know, intensive talks have been going on among Member States on this field. In addition, deposit insurance schemes will be strengthened and harmonised as part of the banking union. In the future, the Banking Union, when properly implemented, will help us avoid using taxpayers’ money for bank bail-outs. The Banking Union may also be complemented by structural reforms, as suggested by the High-level Expert Group on reforming the EU banking sector.2 The European Commission is currently finalising its stance on the issue, and further proposals are expected in the near future. Preparations for Single Supervisory Mechanism Today, I would like to focus on the status of preparations for the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The EU Regulation assigning supervisory tasks to the ECB became effective in early November. Already well ahead of this time, the ECB and national supervisors started practical preparations to ensure timely adoption of supervisory responsibilities by the SSM. As a concrete step, the ECB Governing Council nominated Ms Danièle Nouy, the current Secretary General of the ACPR, the French supervisory authority, for Chair of the Supervisory Board of the new Single Supervisory Mechanism. Her nomination was confirmed yesterday by the European Parliament. A broader recruitment process for supervisory management positions has also been launched by the ECB. The Supervisory Board of the SSM is now about to start its activities as soon as possible, most likely early next year. Before the ECB assumes its supervisory responsibilities, there is an on-going transition period, during which a comprehensive assessment of significant banks is carried out. During the same period other preparations for the SSM are to be completed. Before the assumption of the SSM supervisory role, the results of the Comprehensive Assessment and possible corrective measures for banks – where necessary – will be disclosed. In November 2014, the ECB starts to directly supervise significant banks – in close cooperation with national supervisors. In addition, while other banks continue to be supervised by national supervisors, the ECB can assume direct supervision of any one of credit institutions in order to ensure consistent application of high supervisory standards. Comprehensive Assessment The Comprehensive Assessment is an essential element of the preparations for the SSM, also stipulated by the regulation assigning the supervisory responsibilities to the ECB (also known as SSM Regulation). It should be noted that the SSM Regulation not only requires the ECB to carry out the comprehensive assessment, but it also enables the ECB to obtain all the relevant information from the national authorities necessary for making the assessment. The Comprehensive Assessment has three main goals. First of all, the assessment aims at transparency through enhancing the quality of information available on the condition of banks. Its second goal is to repair banks’ condition by identifying and implementing necessary corrective actions where necessary. Finally, the Comprehensive assessment                                                 2  See High-level Expert Group on reforming the structure of the EU banking sector, Chaired by Erkki Liikanen, Final Report, Brussels, 2 October 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  builds confidence by assuring all relevant stakeholders that banks are fundamentally sound and trustworthy. The ECB will conduct the Comprehensive Assessment in close cooperation with national authorities. The ECB will detail the design and strategy of the assessment exercise, monitor its execution, perform quality assurance as well as collect and consolidate the results and finalise and disclose the overall assessment. National supervisors execute the exercise at the national level, benefitting from local knowledge, but following common data requirements and methodology. The Comprehensive Assessment is a truly huge effort, involving around 130 banking groups, with a very large coverage in the euro area. For Finland, the Assessment will cover three main banking groups, OP-Pohjola Group, Nordea Bank Finland Oyj, as well as Danske Bank Oyj. The Comprehensive Assessment comprises three main pillars: First, a Risk Assessment Exercise addresses key risks in the banks’ balance sheets, including liquidity, leverage and funding. Second, an Asset Quality Review examines banks’ balance sheets based on information at the end of 2013. Third, a Stress Test complements the asset quality review by providing a forward-looking view of banks’ risk-absorption capacity under stress. The structure of the Comprehensive Assessment also clarifies the frequently asked question on the differences between the exercise and previously conducted EU level stress tests with clearly identified problems. The key difference is that the separate risk assessment exercise and asset quality review are conducted before the stress-test, applying common definitions. Three targets can be achieved: • Banks’ risks and asset quality are assessed in a comprehensive manner at the Banking Union level. Assessments are made applying common definitions, not allowing for diverging national interpretations. • Sufficient corrective measures can be guaranteed as the ECB in its supervisory role will have all the necessary supervisory powers. • Quality of assessments is ensured not only by the ECB’s strict procedure for on-going quality assurance, but also by the involvement of third party evaluators. In addition, a critical approach will be taken in stress-testing on banks’ internal models and their own assessments on performance. The ECB will conclude the Comprehensive Assessment in October 2014, before assuming its supervisory role. The results of the assessment will be published in a single disclosure, including all three parts of the exercise. The results of the Comprehensive Assessment will be followed by corrective measures where necessary. Such measures could include, for instance, recapitalisation, also through profit retention, equity issuance, re-orientation of funding sources, asset separation and sales. The Member States will make appropriate arrangements for ex ante availability of national backstops to be used only in case if private sources of capital are insufficient for corrective measures. Other preparatory work for SSM Alongside the Comprehensive Assessment, a lot of preparatory work is on-going for the SSM supervision. The SSM Supervisory Model is the heart of the structure of the SSM activities. For supervisory issues, the ECB decision-making structure is different from the monetary policy. Following the legal provisions, all key decisions are to be finally approved by the ECB Governing Council. However, as regards supervisory matters, the new Supervisory Board will have a predominant role. The Board will provide the Governing Council with a draft 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  decision, and the Governing Council approves it through a so called non-objection procedure. This procedure also helps keep monetary policy and banking supervision separate within the ECB. At the practical level in the supervisory model, the joint supervisory teams are key actors. Such teams are created for each significant bank or banking group that will be directly supervised by the ECB. Joint supervisory teams are responsible for day-to-day supervision of significant banks. Each team will be composed of staff from both the ECB and national supervisors. The SSM Regulation requires the ECB to take on the direct supervisory role for banks which are deemed “significant” under its provisions. For the identification of significant institutions, mapping of euro area banking systems is necessary. This exercise involves surveying banking group structures and collection of the data on relevant banking groups. For the legal dimension of the SSM, preparations include development of the so called Framework Regulation on covering cooperation within the SSM, among other things. In this respect, a public consultation is expected to take place during first half of 2014. Banking supervision requires a smooth flow of information between banks and supervisors. To this end, a high-standard data reporting framework and the associated infrastructures for the SSM are being developed. Banks’ perspective on SSM From the banks’ perspective, the introduction of the SSM means numerous changes. I will mention here only a few of them. For a cross-border bank, operating in multiple countries within the Banking Union, the single supervision effectively simplifies its contacts with the authorities. It will need to work with a single supervisor and operate following a single rulebook. This implies lower costs for the bank in complying with the regulatory requirements. Common rules and methods of supervision also have a broader impact on competition among banks. The banks are treated equally in supervision and regulatory capture can be fully avoided, thereby ensuring a level playing field. In general, I believe that the SSM will become one of the leading banking supervisors in the world, applying the best possible tools for supervision – and developing such tools also for other supervisors. High-quality supervision will benefit those banks acting prudently and with most efficient business structures. Macroprudential policy Finally, I would like to point out that alongside the preparations for the SSM, a new systemic angle has been added to supervision. Also through the new EU capital requirement legislation, macroprudential policy is becoming effective in the EU. Macroprudential policy is about identifying, preventing and mitigating systemic risks through the application of macroprudential instruments. A key macroprudential instrument to be included in the toolbox of authorities in the EU is the counter-cyclical capital buffer. The relevant authorities may require banks to hold an extra buffer of capital in addition to minimum requirements, for instance if credit growth in the financial system is deemed excessive. Macroprudential policy responsibilities lie in the first place with the national authorities, but the SSM Regulation assigns some macroprudential tasks also to the ECB. In particular, the ECB may decide on stricter measures than national authorities, using the counter-cyclical buffer or other macro-prudential tools provided for by the EU legislation. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  As a conclusion, I would like to end my presentation on a positive note, based on the fresh news we have heard from the Ecofin meeting held the day before yesterday. Discussions about the Single Resolution Mechanism seem to be progressing, and we can expect some good results from Brussels next week. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardian Fullani: How the financial crisis has impacted central bank cooperation and EU economic, financial and regulatory developments Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the high-level conference “On international central bank cooperation before, during and after the crisis”, hosted by the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 9 December 2013. *      *      * Dear Participants, It is an honor for me to participate in this important conference and I want to thank the organizers for inviting me. In my speech I will focus on how the recent financial crisis has changed the central bank work with respect to the adoption of macro-prudential policy and its relationship with monetary policy. Then I will share some thoughts on the experience of SEE countries during the crisis, and highlight some of the challenges they face given the recent economic, financial and regulatory developments in the EU. The crisis we are going through, being so profound and lasting, will leave its mark on economics in general, and central banking in particular. Up until the Great Recession, monetary policy was living in a world that we may call “the inflation targeting era”. In many ways inflation targeting made the central bank’s job relatively simple, as long as it followed the policy correctly. The Central Bank, seen by the public as an independent institution, had to credibly commit to an explicit inflation target, in order to anchor mid-term inflation expectations. Self-fulfilling expectations from economic agents and price setters would, in turn, help deliver the objectives of monetary policy. Economists believed that by stabilizing consumer prices, financial assets would also behave in a stable and predictable way. The crisis painfully reminds us that behavior in financial markets is not always rational and lack of confidence in the markets can spiral out of control, sending shockwaves throughout the economy. Escalating asset prices and their sudden burst affected significantly the behavior and balance sheets of the economic agents and challenged the stability of the financial system. In this respect, the concept of financial stability was seen as a byproduct of monetary stability. Micro-prudential supervision was focusing on the soundness of individual financial institutions, with the belief that this was sufficient to ensure aggregate stability of the financial system. Again, the recent financial crisis made it clear that micro-prudential supervision was insufficient to detect and address buildup of risks in the entire financial system due to externalities, herd behaviors, common exposures and pro-cyclicality in financial system activity. Moreover, financial institutions of systemic importance proved to be “too big to fail” and measures were needed to deal with existing systemic institutions on a global and local level. Recovery and resolution powers of financial institutions are being strengthened. Limiting systemic risk, both in its time and structural dimension, is the objective of macro-prudential policy. In the last 3 years, there has been significant progress in the identification of several instruments designed: • to address the rapid expansion and concentration in lending activity; • to ensure that banks have sufficient liquidity to cope with different shocks; • and to discourage risky behavior by financial institutions by increasing demand for capital for such activities. These measures may have countercyclical nature and could apply to financial institutions based on their systemic importance. These standards require building an institutional framework with clear identification of the authority /authorities that will have macro-prudential powers, in accordance with the structure 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  and level of market development. Central bank appears to be better positioned than other authorities to perform the macro-prudential role. In addition to its exclusive responsibility on formulating and implementing monetary policy, central bank has other advantages related with: • its involvement in developing the payments systems infrastructure; • its access to wide market and financial system data; • and, many times, its role as a regulator and supervisor of banks. Nowadays it is widely accepted that there has been huge progress worldwide in ensuring legal and operational independence of the central bank and this is another important reason why it can be entrusted with macro-prudential policy. In order to correctly define the macro-prudential function of the central bank, it is important to establish the right relationship with monetary policy. This can be done with the understanding that both policies, if designed and implemented properly, complement each other. Monetary policy can still pursue its course following low inflationary pressures, while the macro-prudential measures can be used to address early risks developing under a low interest rate environment. On the other hand, macro-prudential measures can also be used to mitigate risks from incoming capital flows, in an environment of relatively high real interest rates. Instances of conflict among the two policies should not be neglected though. These instances can be more pronounced if the objectives of the two policies are wrongly defined in a certain financial situation, or respective tools are used out of their scope. For this reason, I believe that it might be helpful to uphold the monetary policy as the primary objective of the central bank. Stabilizing inflation should be something that central bankers may be proud of, something that we should cherish and continue to strive for. But we must recognize that financial stability issues and related macro-prudential measures have to gain significantly more grounds in central bank discussions and decisions. Clearly, the course of the monetary policy will continue to be extensively discussed in the future, based on our improved understanding of the role of asset prices and financial frictions. Incorporating financial stability objectives with the inflation targeting regime we have considered in Albania as an opportunity to understand and address economic developments and potential macro-financial risks, in order to preserve long-run economic stability. While the mandate on macro-prudential policy and its tools must be clear, one has to recognize that it can have wider effects in financial system and the real economy. For this reason, discussions on macro-prudential policy and measures must involve other authorities, including the fiscal one. Many countries have now established an inter-institutional entity with soft or hard powers in designing and implementing macro-prudential policy to mitigate systemic risk. The role of the central bank in these inter-institutional entities will reflect their legislation and tradition, and independence objective. Although central banks may not always chair such entities, central banks play a critical role in underpinning their functioning given the information and expertise they provide. How have such policies developed in the South Eastern Europe (SEE) region? In spite of solid growth in the run up to it, the global crisis found SEE in a vulnerable position. To a large extent, its growth model was based on encouraging domestic absorption which in turn was partly financed through external borrowing. Financial inflows were channeled in SEE economies largely through EU bank subsidiaries. In SEE, they encouraged investment in real estate and services sectors and were reflected in large current account deficits. External competitiveness and structural reforms slipped gradually through the policymaker’s agenda, while fiscal positions were allowed to deteriorate and financial safety nets were weak. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  As a result, when the crisis hit SEE faced both a structural and a cyclical problem. The overall economic structure was not competitive while growth declined as external demand collapsed and domestic demand suffered from higher uncertainties, higher risk premium and lack of funding. On the financial side, our economies suffered as foreign banks deleveraged and reduced their exposure to SEE. On top of this, several countries faced high vulnerabilities in the financial system, as the NPL’s grew rapidly on a combination of weak growth and FX currency loans to un-hedged borrowers. This picture is of course a generalization. Different countries have had different experiences, depending from their initial conditions and policy responses. However, the crisis exposed several weaknesses of this economic model. At the same time, to the extent that there are differences among countries, we can draw more conclusions from our experience: • Countries with favorable initial conditions suffered the least. Albania has been one such case. We have not entirely avoided the build-up in imbalances, but we have been careful enough to avoid currency mismatches in bank lending, to foster a prudent business model for the banking system, to avoid short-term currency inflows and to focus on overall stability as a precondition for long term growth. • Countries with stability and long-term oriented policies have performed better. The policy dilemma in SEE has largely been whether to support economic growth through countercyclical policies or to prioritize economic and financial stability through tough corrective action. Providing macroeconomic stimulus if your economy is import-oriented may prove to be a futile exercise. As a result, in Albania we have increased our efforts to restructure the economy. The BoA has also sought to increase transparency in the banking system and to strengthen its balance sheets, both through capital increases and through tackling bad loans. The latter has been done through promoting credit restructuring or credit write-offs. In this regards the focus of bank of Albania will include a micro-approach in analyzing the bad debtors of systemic importance. • International cooperation is a prerequisite for mitigating contagion effects and for successful crisis management. Particularly, the Vienna Initiative has been instrumental in limiting the deleveraging process of the private banking system in our economies. • Safety nets have to be improved, in order to make them more efficient and sustainable. Several issues remain to be solved. SEE economies have rightly chosen integration in EU as their main goal. It helps to anchor their political systems, their structural reforms, their legal and regulatory environment and their macroeconomic and financial policies. However, the economic growth model has to change. The main focus of national authorities in SEE should be to facilitate the allocation of capital to more productive sectors, by providing the right incentives structural reforms, legal environment, tax policies, and economic stability. In the financial system of these countries, dominated by banks, the deleveraging process is undergoing under the pressure of the deteriorating loan quality. Credit is made scarce as banks have become risk averse and hesitate to lend to potential borrowers by tightening lending terms. Hence, real sector agents, particularly firms operating in ailing sectors of the economy, are facing surmounting short-term financing difficulties and have lost sight of their future objectives. The process of restructuring in these firms has to find ways for their business to change and become efficient, in order to survive and restart growth. Finance and knowhow is particularly important during such restructuring phase. What role has the financial system in this process? We have to be clear on two issues: (1) we have constructed a financial system and pursued a financial integration strategy based on banks. In fact, they comprise more than 90% of the financial system throughout the region. We think this model is successful and with some minor revisions should serve our economies 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  in the future. For one, foreign banks bring expertise and mostly stability to the financial system. But, recent experience has softened this argument. (2) Banks should be the main vehicle of financial inflow. As converging economies SEE is expected to run current account deficits. As such, it is a capital hungry region which international banks should intermediate. A new business model relying purely on domestically generated deposits is a wrong answer to the previous extreme of huge capital inflows. A more happy medium should be sought, one based on careful and sustainable inflow of funds. How is the Single Supervisory Mechanism going to affect the work of the central banks in the region? I believe the SSM mechanism is going to have a positive impact on central bank (and regulatory authorities) in the region discharging their responsibilities with regard to supervision and macro-prudential policies. Regulators in the region will now talk to a single “home” supervisor, and this is expected to bring more attention to their supervisory concerns. This process could be strengthened further if the central banks in the region improve their own cooperation and are able to identify common position in their communication with the European Central Bank. This could address better the concern that the single supervisor could be more distant to worries of regulators coming from small countries in the region. Being able to cooperate with a single “home” supervisor, will be instrumental in achieving faster progress in the process of regulatory convergence, and establish a more level playing field for financial institutions in the region. This is something that is being closely guided by the Vienna II Initiative. In addition to preparing implementation of various regulatory standards related with countercyclical macro-prudential tools, with particular short term importance is the issue linked with recognition and the treatment of the NPL. In the recent past, some of the countries in the region have been affected by the deleveraging process started in the EU financial system. This was mostly felt during 2012, following the higher capital requirements associated with EBA stress test of November 2011 and relevant steps taken by national “home” authorities to comply with capital requirements. Next in line is the Asset Quality Review by the ECB. Our hope and belief is that this time, concerns of the SEE countries regarding potential further deleveraging, will be considered more carefully and more specifically, to avoid further potential deleveraging. Let me reiterate that the economies in our region currently rely heavily in bank financing and there is a growing need to make credit flow again in the economy. To conclude, allow me to point out the importance of establishing a sound framework for macro-prudential policy, both in terms of tools and institutional approach, in order to deal effectively and timely with prevention of systemic risk. They should be accompanied however, by measures related with the strengthening of crisis management framework. If designed properly, macro-prudential policy should avoid any conflict with monetary policy, and instead should complement it appropriately. Countries in the SEE should benefit from synergies related with the adoption of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. These benefits could be larger if we manage to strengthen our regional cooperation. We are still concerned with potential further deleveraging following the forthcoming Asset Quality Review process and we hope that ECB and other authorities in the Eurozone and EU, could design it to limit these impact in maximum. Thank you very much for your attention! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ajith Nivard Cabraal: Sri Lanka’s peace dividend and recipe for growth and stability Presentation by Mr Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the 25th Anniversary Convention of the Association of Professional Bankers “Beyond growth – a formula for success”, Colombo, 8 October 2013. *      *      * President of the Association of Professional Bankers, Mr. Aravinda Perera. Guest of Honour and Immediate Past Governor, Reserve Bank of India, Dr. D. Subbarao, Deputy Governors of the Central Bank, Distinguished delegates at the 25thAnniversary Conference of the Association of Professional Bankers, My dear friends. At the outset, I wish to thank the Association of Professional Bankers for inviting me this evening to share a few thoughts on the occasion of their 25th Anniversary Conference. I am also delighted that a highly accomplished and eminent scholar who has held the esteemed offices of Secretary to the Ministry of Finance of India and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Dr. Subbarao is here to deliver the Keynote Address, at this august Conference. I am sure his scholarly inputs, spiced with his rich experiences would add immense value to the deliberations of your Conference, and that such foundation would provide the most appropriate platform for the timely Conference Theme: “Beyond Growth – A Formula for Success”. Knowing the high technical prowess, vast experience and wonderful oratorical skills of Dr. Subbarao, I do not think I need to offer any comment on the theme of the Conference, since he would do ample justice to that topic. Therefore, I shall merely concentrate on the subject area that the President of the APB invited me to dwell upon, namely “Sri Lanka’s Peace Dividend and Recipe for Growth and Stability”. My dear friends, when any person looks around our country they will witness the massive and rapid infrastructure development taking place. They will also experience the phenomenal changes that have taken place, and are taking place in our economy. The past major drawback in our country and economy, namely, the terrorism conflict, is now over, and we have so far enjoyed about four and a half years of peace and tranquility. Much has happened during that period, which really is the peace dividend, although sometimes we do not think of it on those terms. Therefore, in order to set the background for my address, let me quickly reflect on some of these achievements. In the post-conflict economy, Sri Lanka recorded many important milestones. Per capita income doubled to reach over US dollars 2,900 in a relatively short period, thereby elevating the country to an “emerging market economy” status; the economy grew to a robust US dollar 59 billion, from about US dollars 24 billion in 2004; Inflation was controlled at single digits for more than four and a half years; Poverty levels reduced to around 6 percent from about 15%; Unemployment reduced to less than 4 percent; The quality of infrastructure was enhanced to a level comparable with many emerging market economies; Foreign reserves were maintained at over 6 billion US dollars; The public debt was managed prudently so as to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio from a high of 105 percent in 2003 to about 78 percent; An over 8 percent economic growth was achieved in successive years 2010 and 2011; Private foreign investment inflows into the government has exceeded US$ 7 billion; The Fiscal deficit was limited to 6.4% in 2012, from a high of 9.9% in 2009; The country’s Doing Business global rank has reached the 81st level, up from 102nd in 2010, while being poised to jump about 10 places this year; Regional development has made tangible progress and the Western Province share of GDP reduced to around 43% from 51% in 2005; Regular foreign investment has flowed into banks and the stock market; The banking system was maintained in a stable condition even in the midst of very difficult global circumstances. Needless to say, the collective efforts that we have all put together to improve and sustain the positive outlook for our nation, have ensured a conducive investment 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  atmosphere. In that regard, the stable inflation and the comparatively lower interest rate regime prevailing today, serves as an important support to businesses, by reducing the risk factors. Moreover, the country’s peaceful environment, complemented by political stability, has been able to ensure the continued safety of investments, while providing a reasonable yield. In this context, the robust investment framework along the lines of the “5+1” hub concept, has now opened out new ventures in promoting maritime, aviation, energy, knowledge and commercial sectors, while tourism is emerging as a further thrust industry with great promise. My dear friends, those in the banking sector know very well that there were many special initiatives that were taken over the past several years at various times, in order to fashion and support this transformation. For purposes of completeness, let us quickly recollect a few such major initiatives that helped us in this regard. We established consultative and advisory committees from the private sector for monetary policy and financial system stability; We opened out Sri Lanka Treasury Bills and Bonds to foreign investors; We issued international Sovereign Bonds; We introduced mandatory corporate governance practices for banks and NBFIs; We developed resolution schemes to stabilize systemically important banks and NBFIs, and when needed, we applied such schemes practically; We established a Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme; We fashioned the current “virtuous cycle” – low inflation to low interest rates to higher investment to higher growth, etc.; We accessed an IMF SBA on our terms, and completed the programme; We intervened in the application of certain fiscal policies, which were sympathetic to inflation behavior and other macro-economic factors; We implemented tough monitoring of inflation control measures; We introduced some far-reaching stabilization measures whenever needed; We relaxed Foreign Exchange Regulations on a planned basis. That list of “Have dones” is therefore an impressive one. But, we would be the first to admit that, that is the past. The challenge now would be as to what more we should do in our journey into the future. How do we reach a US$ 100 billion economy? How do we proceed beyond the US$ 4,000 per capita income level? How do we ensure that we do not fall prey to the deadly “middle-income trap” that has snared many countries in the past? How do we ensure that our transformation is sustainable and long lasting? How do we maintain momentum? In short, what is the “recipe” that Sri Lanka must have for growth and stability, in the next decade and beyond? I believe all those questions are important ones, for the economic policy planners to reflect upon, and to share with other key stakeholders of the economy. While doing so, there would also be many matters and issues that all stakeholders of the economy would need to give their continuous attention, and share with policy makers. It’s a two way process! In that context, I believe your 25th Anniversary Conference would provide a useful opportunity for a broader discussion on this all important “recipe”, so that we, as policy makers would also benefit by your rich and professional contributions. My dear friends, in my view, Sri Lanka’s long term growth and stability recipe would need to contain several key ingredients. First, the maintenance of sound macro fundamentals and the continuous movement of those macro fundamentals in a positive and benign direction. What that would mean, in a practical sense, is that we will have to maintain inflation at low and stable levels for the next decade. That would, in turn, mean that the demand side management would have to be carefully anticipated and managed, while the required interventions in the supply side will also need to be promoted and encouraged. At the same time, the fiscal consolidation would need to be sustained, so that the positive effects of such effort would enable the debt dynamics to improve constantly. Those efforts would also have to be supported by on-going improvements in productivity, with the resulting benefits influencing the exchange rate as well. Businesses will have to become more productive, competitive and efficient, and the overall expansion of the economy through new fronts, particularly the 5 Hubs and Tourism, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  would need to continue in a focused fashion. By constantly improving our enabling environment and economic structures, as well as by ensuring that the private sector stays vibrant, motivated and well financed, the economy should be able to consistently grow at over 7% per annum, and in certain years, even exceed 8%. By maintaining such a momentum, our economy would become more resilient and diversified, thereby enabling us to face whatever new risks that could emerge from an unpredictable global environment. Second, Sri Lanka would need to attract regular capital from outside our shores in order to bridge our current savings/investment gap so as to sustain the over 7% growth momentum. In the past, some persons have been pre-occupied with the notion that foreign direct investments and investments into the Government, are the only channels through which foreign savings could enter our country. However, we have taken a broader view, and we believe that our savings/investment gap could be bridged through several sources in addition to the traditional sources. As a result, we have encouraged foreign inflows into the banking sector, foreign inflows into the stock and corporate bond markets, and foreign inflows as loan capital into eligible businesses. All these channels have now been made transparent and convenient, thereby making it easy for overseas investors to make their investments. These convenient inflows, with appropriate safeguards for the providers of capital would enable the country to enjoy a sustained inflow of savings, which would, in turn, support the high growth momentum envisaged by the economy. Third, we need to continuously ensure the stability of the financial system. In this regard, the banking and the NBFI sectors, as well as the insurance sector would play very important roles, and over the next few years, we are keen that a consolidation takes place in these sectors, in order to have strong institutions within these sectors. In today’s hostile and volatile environment, it is necessary for the banks and NBFIs to at least have a minimum critical mass, in order to be competitive, resilient and strong. That would necessarily mean that some of the smaller and less stronger institutions would need to merge with each other, or become the targets of strategic acquisitions in order to create large and strong institutions in this sector. Such a consolidation would also enable the governance structures to improve, as well as reduce today’s rather high “cost per transaction”, as a result of the enhanced scale of operations. Therefore, over the next few years, it would be necessary to fashion and encourage such a consolidation outcome, and the policies that would lead to such an outcome would need to be encouraged. Fourth, the country will have to sustain its poverty reduction strategies as well continue with strategies that are designed to foster balanced regional growth. Over the past four and a half years, an enormous investment has been made in the North, which has resulted in the Northern Province reaching a reasonable parity viz-a-viz the other provinces. This has been an amazing achievement, and I believe we have now been able to set the stage for a more gradual improvement of all provinces, so that we could bring all the provinces closer to the standard of the Western Province, which has already comfortably surpassed a US$ 4,000 per capita income. The recent infrastructure development drive at rural level, particularly the construction and upgrade of the rural roads and the supply of electricity to every household in the country, together with the massive strides we have made in making finance accessible to all people in all parts of the country, have greatly helped to fulfill these objectives. Therefore, the stage is now well set for the constant upgrade of a variety of services at Provincial level, and the effective integration of all areas of the country, with better roads, technology, communication, business services and banking services. Such improvements would serve to reduce provincial disparities, and thereby allow the country to achieve its ambitious goal of less than 3% poverty by 2016. At the same time, as a result of the fast tracked development of the provinces, we could probably reach a situation where the GDP contribution from the advanced Western Province would only constitute around 33%, by the year 2025. Such an outcome would indicate a sustained revival of the 8 lagging Provinces, which collectively accounted for less than 50% of the GDP contribution in the year 2005. Accordingly, if within 20 years, 2005 to 2025, the Western Province share of the 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  country’s GDP could be reduced from one-half to one-third, I believe we would be well on track to balanced regional growth, whilst also not depriving the Western Province of the fruits of rapid development. Such a transformation would mean that the cry which led to two bloody revolutions, namely, “kolombata kiri, gamata kekiri” would be a slogan which could then be comfortably relegated to the dust-bin of history. Fifth, we would need to enhance the productivity levels of the country, whilst also managing the migration of a large work force from the current traditional sectors to some of the new sectors that are opening out in our economy. Over the next few years, large numbers of youth and other skilled persons would need to form the new back-bone of the labour force that is needed for the 5 Hubs and Tourism, as well as in some of the other growth sectors such as health and education. Where would this new work force come from? Obviously, some will need to migrate from the agricultural sector, while others would need to shift from their present activities to the new areas of activities. Such a shift would necessarily demand that the existing economic activities would have to robustly improve its’ productivity levels, through the use of better techniques and methods, including the application of IT. That transformation would also suggest that a massive education and training effort would be needed, whilst also requiring the enhancement of the levels of productivity and work ethnic, particularly in the agriculture sector. Those changes would be vital, as well as, good for our economy. Vital, because when such a shift takes place towards the new thrust areas, the transformation of the economy will take place as planned. Good, because some of the economic sectors, particularly agriculture, where we had been used to very low levels of productivity, would have to get its act together and quickly transform itself to new and better methods of resource use so as to do more with less! In that scenario, exciting opportunities will emerge towards the realization of overall higher levels of productivity, and I believe the bedrock for our future sustainable development would be this productivity improvement across all sectors of our economy. Sixth, Sri Lanka must continuously improve its global rankings. As is well known, our country had been lagging behind in the world scene on many fronts, mainly as a result of our focus for nearly 30 years, being on just keeping body and soul together in the face of the deadly terrorist threats. As a result, up until a few years ago, our global rankings were quite dismal and low. Of course, our rankings were somewhat high on health and education and very high on cricket! But unfortunately on many business related indices, we were lagging far behind many countries, and our scores in Doing Business, economic freedom, global competiveness, etc. were certainly not flattering. However, about 2 years ago, we started an initiative to carefully examine the criteria that is used to rank countries in relation to various indices, and taking the necessary steps to improve in each of these areas, and prove to the world that we really mean business! I believe if our efforts continue to prove successful over the next few years, and Sri Lanka materially improves its global rankings on many business indices, we would stand out as an economy with great promise and potential. That would also help us to be well positioned to truly gain recognition as a global Hub. In this connection, let me relate a little story that may indicate Sri Lanka’s growing promise and potential. A few days ago, a high ranking official of one of a major multinationals met with me, and he told me that they are becoming increasingly frustrated by the very high costs that they have to bear in the top Asian capitals of Tokyo, Beijing, Singapore, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Manila and Kuala Lampur, which is making it increasingly expensive for them to do business in those cities. According to this official, their Head Office is therefore actively searching for alternate cities in Asia with good quality infrastructure, high standards of law and order, efficient communication, convenient sea and air connectivity and excellent living conditions, in order to consider re-location of some of their regional offices. In that regard, he said to me that within the next few years, if Sri Lanka is able to display a high degree of improvement in each of these areas of interest to multinationals like them, Sri Lanka could very well be a strong candidate for consideration by such global giants, to locate their regional offices. In this conversation, what struck me first was that such a conversation would 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  never have been even remotely possible, just five years ago. What struck me second, was the fact that Sri Lanka is today moving into the radar screen of global giants, which shows that we are being taken seriously. That, my dear friends, to my mind, is one of the best indications that Sri Lanka is gradually reaping the peace dividend after its 30 year conflict! Seventh, Sri Lanka would need to show progress of its political stability on a sustained basis, over the next several years. As we all know, high norms of democracy have been maintained and peaceful conditions exist, in our country, compared to many other countries. However, a strong negative publicity has been drummed up by a certain segments of the overseas Sri Lankan diaspora, through which such groups have been able to portray Sri Lanka as a country with political and human rights deficiencies. Unfortunately, the massive progress Sri Lanka has made in recent years with regular elections, terrorism and violence free conditions, rapid economic development, large scale investments, large numbers of newspapers, TV and radio stations publishing and beaming news almost every second without any censorship whatsoever, have not been given sufficient credit, internationally, as a result of the outside world being bombarded with the false claims by these anti-Sri Lanka forces. Although the efforts of these inimical groups are gradually losing steam in the face of the Sri Lankan political structures being continuously strengthened, there is however a vital need for Sri Lanka as a country, and for all Sri Lankans as individuals, to work towards developing our external image on a continuous basis. In that context, we must constantly remind our overseas friends that Sri Lanka is a country that has a 2,500 year history with strong political institutions and an educated, politically savvy population, and that the people of different castes, creeds, and ethnicity, interact lot better than in many other countries. By doing so, we could effectively challenge and deal with the build up of various false myths that may have the potential to threaten the political stability in our country over the next few years. If we are able to respond successfully, and convey this reality to the outside world in a comprehensive manner, we could put to rest, many of the unfair and false allegations that have been leveled against the country. My dear friends, what I have endeavoured to explain so far are the key ingredients that would need to be used in the recipe for growth and stability. However, as we all know, ingredients alone won’t provide us with a tasty, wholesome dish. To turn out a tasty dish, we need to use the ingredients, in the right quantity and quality, prepare and temper those ingredients properly, mix them appropriately, and cook them at the right temperature according to the required method. It is only then that the dish will be tasty, attractive and wholesome. What then is our next challenge? In my view, the special ingredients that I have so far spoken of, as well as the other elements that are needed to develop a good economy, namely, basic common sense, good timing, sound policy mix, sensible political considerations, continuous well-being of the people, would all need to be generously used as flavours in the preparation of the final dish of growth and stability. We would also need to maintain the balance of all the ingredients at the right “temperature” if the outcome is to be right. After all, a dish, if it is overdone or half done, is not going to be edible. In the same way, if economic planners do not judiciously give consideration to developing and matching the right mix of policies which work, and being sensitive to the timing and sequence of the flow of the policy implementation, the growth and stability of the economy would not be attainable. Mr. Chairman, my dear friends, over the past 7 years, I believe we have been able to deal with many challenges from within and outside, and that is why we have been able to deliver stability and growth to our economy. Nevertheless, we must all remember that yesterday’s tasty meal will not necessarily mean that tomorrow’s meal will also be tasty. Tomorrow is another fresh challenge with different considerations, and circumstances. If we are able to assess these conditions cleverly, and develop our plans properly, (and I believe we are well positioned to do so), Sri Lanka would truly be on course to deliver growth and stability on a sustained basis to our people and our economy. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Mr. Chairman, permit me to conclude by making the simple remark that there is no path to success or prosperity, other than via careful planning and hard work. Sri Lanka has so far progressed with promise, because we have “walked the talk”. Many of the goals that we set in the past and the major projects that we set our sights upon, have been realized, or are taking shape before our very own eyes, because of dedicated and committed actions. Let’s be encouraged and inspired by those successes. Let’s also step up for the future, and get ready to deliver growth and stability on a consistent basis. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Peter Praet: Economic recovery in the euro area – the role of monetary policy Speech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Belgian Financial Forum, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, 13 December 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank Federic Holm-Hadulla for his contribution to the preparation of this speech. Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to speak to you at today’s event. I would like to use this opportunity to share my assessment of where we stand in terms of economic and monetary developments in the euro area.  I will start with the economic situation we currently face and give you my take on the future outlook, also on the basis of latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which – as you know – play an important role in informing our economic analysis on a quarterly basis. We are moving on a trajectory of modest growth, gradually recovering from the economic downturn of the past years. Still headwinds persist and I elaborate in a minute on the most important headwinds that we currently seeing.  I will also discuss the signals coming from our monetary analysis, which assesses money and credit developments to identify risks to price stability over a medium- and long-term horizon. Here, particularly the credit side presents itself as still sluggish, thus pointing to subdued price developments in the medium term future.  Finally, I will draw together the complementary bits and pieces of our analysis to explain our current monetary policy orientation, which is characterised by two features: first, that we expect our key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time; and, second, that we stand ready to adopt additional accommodative monetary policy measures, if and when necessary to safeguard price stability. Our latest economic analysis Let me start by briefly summarising how we see the euro area economy evolving, including an assessment of the latest Eurosystem staff projections. The recovery continues to proceed at a modest and uneven pace across the euro area. In fact, real GDP is projected to pick up from the fourth quarter of this year onwards, and the recovery is expected to accelerate slightly by the end of next year.  In the euro area as a whole, real GDP is projected to still contract this year by 0.4%, but then to increase by 1.1% in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015.  According to our staff’s projections, the sustained increase in activity would be mainly driven by a gradual recovery in domestic and external demand, with the pickup in domestic demand being supported by several factors:  First, reduced uncertainty is expected to gradually feed through to the real economy.  Second, our accommodative monetary policy stance will continue to support the recovery, by providing for: low monetary policy interest rates; extensive funding reassurance to euro area banks, inter alia, by offering liquidity via the fixed rate full allotment mode at least until mid-2015; and a lasting positive impact of forward guidance on money market conditions.  Third, the euro area economy will encounter less fiscal drag as countries have made important progress in improving their budgetary positions.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Fourth, real disposable incomes are expected to benefit from a drop in commodity prices.  And, finally, starting from 2014, the recovery is also expected to benefit from fading credit supply constraints.  Still, the key question to ask is why are we not moving faster out of the crisis?  The recovery continues to face headwinds, especially in stressed countries and a number of factors may hinder a faster recovery. First, notwithstanding some progress in rebalancing, in many euro area countries we will still see further adjustment of private and public sector balance sheets. Don’t forget in this context that past recoveries have been driven by a pick-up in housing and construction activity that then continued to feed its way through to overall economy. Now, with a lot of household wealth lost in this crisis and with the balance sheets of the private and public sectors still retrenching, this traditional source for recovery seems to be hampered and less desirable, calling for more structural and balanced growth models.  Second, and closely related, investment has been declining over the past year and will most likely only gradually pick-up, starting from levels far below pre-crisis averages. Of course, anaemic demand conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring and high lending rates particularly for SMEs are in several countries weighing on investment.  And third, labour market conditions do not provide much comfort. Unemployment is expected to remain high and persistent. Considering also the somewhat less favourable outlook in labour intensive sectors and the growing structural component in the current unemployment figures we may see sluggish labour market conditions for some time in the future, despite decreasing labour cost conditions.  Overall, a significant amount of slack in the economy will persist until the end of the projection horizon. Moreover, the balance of risks around the projected real GDP growth outlook is to the downside in 2014 and 2015. This reflects mainly three risk factors, comprising: potentially higher oil prices, lower euro area foreign demand and additional fiscal consolidation efforts, in particular in 2015.  So what does all this imply for price developments? In keeping with the weak economic dynamics, we continue to expect subdued inflation extending into the medium-term. According to our staff projections, euro area HICP inflation is projected to edge slightly upwards from 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 1.2–1.3% over the rest of the projection horizon. In yearly averages, HICP inflation is projected to reach 1.4% in 2013, 1.1% in 2014 and 1.3% in 2015.  When interpreting the subdued inflation profile, it is also important to consider its main drivers. For example, if we are merely observing a one-off decline in more volatile components of HICP inflation, this is less of a policy concern than if low inflation reflects the interplay of more durable economic factors, thus showing up also in less volatile components. However, decomposing euro area inflation over the last two years into more or less volatile components does not yield a clear-cut picture in this regard. On the one hand, we see that energy and food prices (both of which tend to be relatively volatile) play a major role – accounting for about 80% of the 2.1 percentage point decline in HICP inflation over that period.  On the other hand, we also observe a decline in the contributions from non-energy industrial goods and most notably services prices – both of which are more closely related to fundamental factors.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Also, low inflation can be an outcome of policy measures. A case in point is Germany, where inflation has remained relatively low, despite a robust recovery from the crisis. But wage developments have been moderate in Germany, with compensation per employee growing by just 1.8% year on year in reflection of structural reforms that have been undertaken in the past. And, Germany compared with other euro area countries has recorded a relatively low contribution from higher indirect taxes and administrative prices to inflation.  At the euro area level, our staff sees the risks to the projected HICP inflation outlook slightly on the upside towards the end of the projection horizon. This is because upside risks from higher oil prices, a depreciation of the euro and higher indirect taxes are only partly offset by downside risks stemming from lower foreign and domestic demand. Overall, the staff projections are in line with our assessment of subdued underlying price and cost pressures that suggest a period of prolonged low inflation.  Indeed, pipeline price pressure pressures appear low with producer prices having declined for a while, recently declining even further to –1.4% in October from –0.9% in September. Also labour cost pressures are very much contained, particularly in the presence of moderate wage growth, high unemployment and ample spare capacity. External price pressures eased during the first three quarters of 2013, i.a. owing to sluggish global demand and declines in oil and non-oil commodity prices. The import deflator is thus estimated to have declined in year-on-year terms over this period. While it will continue to fall in the following quarters as a result of these factors, the import deflator is expected to increase slightly from mid-2014 onwards, as the downward impact of the previous appreciation of the euro fades away, as non-energy commodity prices increase and as import demand gains momentum, allowing for stronger mark-ups. On that basis, also our recent assessment from the December Governing Council meeting is fully consistent with what we have been saying now for some time: inflation is low and we do not expect this to change for some time.  Signals from the monetary pillar Let me now turn to the signals we have received from the monetary pillar. In a nutshell, these signals confirm the subdued medium-term inflation outlook deriving from the economic analysis. While monetary dynamics have been weak, essentially since the onset of the crisis, growth in broad money moderated further in recent months.  The annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 decreased to 1.4% in October 2013 (or 1.7 % adjusting for one-off effects), which is the latest available data point, from 2.0% in September 2013. This marks a continuation in the deceleration from previous months. After M3 still grew at 2.8% in the second quarter of 2013, the third quarter recorded a significant drop in this growth rate to 2.2%.  A key driver of these recent developments in M3 is that, in the current environment, monetary assets only yield little remuneration. As a consequence, money holders are incentivised to engage in two types of substitution:  Either they hold very liquid instruments, such as overnight deposits. This shows up in still robust growth in the narrow monetary aggregate M1, which stood at 6.6% in October 2013, slightly down from 6.7% in September.  Or they diversify away from short-term deposits and marketable instruments towards better remunerated – but riskier and less liquid – instruments. To the extent these instruments are outside M3, this dampens the growth in the broader monetary aggregate. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches On a positive note, we are observing some strong net inflows of capital from outside the euro area that support monetary dynamics. Since these inflows are directed at both, stressed and non-stressed euro area countries, they help mitigate financial fragmentation. At the same time, it remains important to reinvigorate sources of money creation also from inside the euro area as the recovery takes hold. In this context, we have to acknowledge that the provision of credit to the real economy continued to contract, even if the pace of that contraction has levelled off recently.  The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 0.3% in October, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year.1 At the same time, the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations was –2.9% in October, compared with –2.8% in September. But on the other for larger firms other sources of financing have been more available. These weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect primarily their lagged relationship with the business cycle, the overall heightened credit risk and the ongoing deleveraging and overall adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, also related to past excesses.  The ECB’s comprehensive balance sheet assessment, including Asset Quality Review and Stress Test, should lead to greater clarity on the state of the banking sector. Combined with appropriate resolution strategies and backstops, this will strengthen banks’ balance sheets and ultimately improve the prospects for bank lending in the future.  Implications for monetary policy How should monetary policy act in these conditions? Assessed against our price stability objective, the subdued inflation outlook, on the back of weak economic and monetary dynamics, clearly warrants an accommodative stance. It is against this background that we lowered rates in November. And it is against this background that we expect our key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.  Taking stock of the effects that our recent policy measures have had on economic and financial conditions, we see positive signs emerging. The November rate cut has been followed by a pronounced and persistent easing in monetary conditions in the euro area – as manifest for instance in a downward shift in term money market interest rates and other important market interest rates.  Moreover, our forward guidance continued to effectively support our policy intentions: first, it has mitigated the sensitivity of the money market term structure to surprises from economic data releases; and second it has reduced market uncertainty about the path of future short term rates. But notwithstanding this favourable track record of our recent policy measures, we should remain alert to any contingencies that may give rise to downside risks to price stability. In particular, we are closely monitoring money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance. By extending the horizon of the fixed rate full allotment mode at least until mid-2015 we have provided additional funding reassurance that will support the transmission of monetary policy signals through the banking system.                                                  1 The number for loans to households and non-financial corporations are adjusted for loan sales and securitisation. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 At the same time, we stand ready to adopt additional measures if we were to observe developments in money market conditions that threaten to interfere with our policy intentions. Moreover, the subdued inflation outlook provides little safety margin against further adverse shocks that may give rise to downside risks to price stability. That safety margin is reflected in our focal point of inflation rates just below 2% in the context of our price stability. It ensures that steady state inflation provides for a sufficient buffer away from zero.  With an inflation outlook below this focal point, our reaction time for additional accommodative policy action shortens accordingly. In this regard, the debate among observers has focused on the question, which measures the ECB were to take under these circumstances. As explained – and demonstrated – in the past, the ECB is in a position to adopt a wide range of instruments to ensure price stability, in line with the extensive instrument independence it has been granted under the Treaties. This allows us to tailor our policy response to the specific contingencies that the euro area may face at a given point in time. We will continuously evaluate our policy options and we will act if the circumstances so warrant and adopt measures that are most effective in confronting the challenges at hand. But we need to be also wary of the limitations of further measures. Let’s not forget that our monetary policy stance is already accommodative and financing conditions are favourable overall.  Indeed, we see sluggish demand for credit despite low lending rates. We see muted investment, despite firms building up cash reserves. This cannot be solved by further accommodation, but is a clear cut case for the right structural policies.  In fact, with structural economic policies directed towards more competitiveness, sustainable fiscal budgets and financial sector policies and governance that set the stage for sound banks’ balance sheet and more stable financial market conditions, economic confidence and confidence in the euro area as an economic and financial centre will return and unleash the willingness for more credit provision, more investment and domestic demand.  Conclusion With this, let me conclude. The euro area economy continues to recover, albeit at a slow and uneven pace. Reflecting the weak economic and monetary dynamics, underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term.  The ECB’s monetary policy has successfully contributed to this outlook. Our stance is accommodative in full consistency with our prime task to maintain price stability in the euro area. This is vindicated by the consistent anchoring of inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Yet, there is no doubt that the outlook on inflation remains subdued and we expect only a very gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. That’s why our monetary policy will continue to provide an appropriate degree of accommodation. And just be reminded that our forward guidance to keep interest rates at present or lower levels for an extended period of time remains in place. Let me also assure you that the ECB has and always will respond to downside risks to price stability if they were to emerge going forward. Here our policy rate margin still leaves some room for manoeuvre and our operational framework provides the necessary tools to react swiftly if warranted.  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches But let’s be clear: by ensuring price stability, the ECB is making its contribution to the economic recovery. Yet, a durable return to robust and sustainable growth requires that governments persevere in their fiscal and structural reform agenda. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jörg Asmussen: Introductory remarks at the press conference on the completion of the EU-funded cooperation programme with the National Bank of Serbia Introductory remarks by Mr Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the press conference on the completion of the EU-funded cooperation programme with the National Bank of Serbia, Belgrade, 12 December 2013. *      *      * Governor Tabaković, Ambassador Davenport, Ambassadors, Ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the media, dear colleagues, Last week, Governor Tabaković was in Frankfurt for the ECB’s high-level conference where we discussed with governors and senior central bankers from all over the world the role that technical cooperation and central bank cooperation more broadly can have in raising staff and institutional capacities. The consensus was that the impact can be high when cooperation is open and honest, and there is strong commitment and dedication on both sides. A highly successful programme Today it is my pleasure to be in Belgrade on the occasion of the closing of the ECB-coordinated technical cooperation programme with the National Bank of Serbia. The programme has received funding from the European Commission through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. The aim of our work has been to support the National Bank of Serbia in its efforts to bring its rules, procedures and processes closer to EU central banking standards and to support the bank in preparing new legislation that implements the legal framework of the European Union. This very programme has been characterised by all the positive things that we agreed last week in Frankfurt would be important for success. The programme we are closing today has been the ECB’s most complex and ambitious programme to date. It has covered 13 different central banking areas and has been implemented in partnership with 21 national central banks from the European System of Central Banks. More than 170 experts from EU central banks have been providing input and guidance to their Serbian colleagues and around 150 Serbian colleagues have been visiting their EU counterparts to get hands-on exposure to systems and procedures used by them in their respective central banks. Together, these experts have developed an impressive number of handbooks, guidelines and procedures, models for economic analysis, statistical systems and new primary or secondary legislative acts; this whole framework has helped the National Bank of Serbia take an important step forward towards implementing EU central banking standards. Looking back, the project got underway on 1 February 2011, when we committed to working together for 24 months. As we were approaching the end, we saw that we had reached all of our targets and objectives in a very effective and efficient way. We therefore agreed to extend the contract by 11 months and to deepen the work in three areas. This work has now too been fully completed and we are ready to close the programme. In most of the areas covered during this time, the National Bank of Serbia will continue to implement work that we started together. You can, for instance, look forward to new and updated statistics for the balance of payments and for the financial accounts, which the National Bank of Serbia plans to start publishing in the next few years. It also has new 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  analytical tools for both macroeconomic and financial stability analysis, allowing it to speak with a stronger voice in the national and international debate. These are only a couple of examples of what this programme has achieved. Obviously the work does not end here. There are still areas within the National Bank of Serbia that need upgrading before it joins the European System of Central Banks. In addition, the EU continues to update rules, regulations and best practices, which means that the target is always moving. Let me turn to a few points that are not directly linked to the programme, but are important as they relate to current challenges in the EU as well as in Serbia. Common challenges in the euro area and in Serbia While central banks have done what they can to limit the most devastating effects of the global financial crisis, there are limits to what the central bank can do. The ECB can keep interest rates low and resort to non-standard measures as warranted by exceptional circumstances, in line with our mandate of price stability. Maintaining price stability is the best contribution that a central bank can make to support economic growth and employment. We cannot, however, address by ourselves the underlying root causes of the problems that relate to fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances, a lack of competitiveness, low growth and high unemployment. Governments of EU Member States have to do their part of the work through structural reforms and fiscal consolidation to return the economy to long-term sustainable growth and to boost employment. While the challenges are obviously not identical, these same issues are also relevant for Serbia. Structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and support growth potential, fiscal consolidation and ultimately sustainable convergence are challenges to be addressed by the political authorities in this country in their endeavour to move closer to the EU. The best contribution the National Bank of Serbia can make to support this is to achieve price stability, based on a sound institutional framework that ensures its independence. Turning back to the euro area, the crisis also revealed that the institutional framework of our Economic and Monetary Union – in which the ECB is the central bank tasked with ensuring price stability – needs to be strengthened. The Heads of State or Government have therefore embarked on reforms of euro area governance, including, for instance, the fiscal framework governing Member States’ fiscal policies with a view to enhancing fiscal discipline. They have also embarked on the creation of a banking union that will centralise critical functions relating to the banking sector at the European level, thereby severing the direct link between sovereigns and their banking sectors that proved to be an Achilles heel during the crisis. Following the necessary political decisions, the ECB has now started building a banking supervisory function that will be responsible for the direct supervision of around 130 systemically relevant banks in the euro area, as well as for the indirect supervision of banks that are not considered systemically relevant. The ECB will assume this role in November next year and will implement the new harmonised model together with the national competent authorities, whether central banks or non-central bank supervisors. We call this the single supervisory mechanism (SSM). This also has implications for EU candidate countries and potential candidates in the Western Balkans, including Serbia, given the role of banks headquartered in the euro area in the banking sectors of the region. The establishment of the SSM implies that for many foreign-owned banks operating in Serbia, the ECB will become the “home” supervisor and they will no longer be supervised by different national supervisors depending on where they have their headquarters. In addition to enhancing the quality of the supervision of parent banks, the SSM has the potential to facilitate home-host country cooperation in banking supervision – thereby strengthening the relationship between the ECB and the National Bank of Serbia in this area as well. In parallel, work is underway on a bank 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  recovery and resolution regime, which in our view is a crucial component in severing the link between sovereigns and banks and will be a complement to the SSM. An immediate priority in the euro area is to repair the balance sheets of commercial banks, where necessary. The ECB is conducting a comprehensive analysis of bank balance sheets before assuming the supervisory responsibility and we have made it clear on many occasions that we need to have a European recovery and resolution regime in place by the time the SSM assumes its responsibilities. Turning to Serbia again, recent developments show that similar challenges apply to the Serbian financial sector, where the level of non-performing loans is high and the National Bank of Serbia together with the relevant national authorities are improving the recovery and resolution framework. In other words, we have some common challenges that we need to address over the coming years. And from the ECB’s side, I can assure you that we will want to remain in close contact with the National Bank of Serbia, continuing our open and honest communication – also in view of the opening of accession negotiations with Serbia. Conclusion Let me finish with a few acknowledgements and by expressing my thanks to all those who have played such an important role in making this project a success: • first, to the national central banks that have provided such a large number of experts to help us implement the programmes; • to the technical cooperation coordinators at the national central banks who have supported the steering committee in its monitoring and guidance on programme implementation; • to the European Commission’s EU Delegation that provided funding to allow us to recover some of our costs; • to the National Bank of Serbia and Governor Tabaković, who, with their open and cooperative spirit and ownership of the programme outcomes, have been a real pleasure to work with; and • last but not least, to the two teams within the ECB and the National Bank of Serbia, who have been coordinating this programme on an ongoing basis. I congratulate all of you on the impressive results you have achieved. Thank you very much for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stephen S Poloz: Monetary policy as risk management Remarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Canadian Club of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, 12 December 2013. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for those kind words. It is a real pleasure to be here in Montréal. I am going to talk today about managing risks. This is something that we all do in all aspects of our lives – whether we are running a business, pursuing a career, or looking after a family. As we make plans in pursuit of a goal, we take into account what could go wrong – and what can be done to mitigate that. Of course, we can never fully eliminate risks – we can only manage them prudently. As an economist and a central banker, I think a lot about risk. I’m not the only one. In response to what we have experienced these last few years, central bankers around the world are adapting the way they do business. At the Bank of Canada, in recognition of the increased uncertainty that surrounds us, we are adjusting our lens on risks, how we evaluate them and how they enter into decisions about monetary policy. That is my topic this afternoon. Monetary policy formulation Not everything has changed, far from it. The best way for the Bank of Canada to deliver on its mandate is, as always, to keep inflation low, stable and predictable. In 1991, the Bank adopted an inflation target and, since 1995, our target has been 2 per cent inflation. The target is sacrosanct. And, in more than two decades of inflation targeting, we have generally succeeded: on average, inflation has been very close to the target. This has not happened by itself. Like navigating a ship, we have had to adjust to the currents around us and to bouts of foul weather. Some of the challenges are minor, calling for temporary adjustments in course or speed. Others may involve a major detour. In worst-case scenarios, there are risks of running aground, or even capsizing. In all cases, we have to anticipate as well as react. The Bank’s Governing Council sets the policy interest rate with the goal of achieving our 2 per cent inflation target. Central to this decision is our view of the most likely path for the Canadian and global economies. Conditional on these forecasts, there is a unique path for interest rates that should bring us back to target, just like the captain who plots the intended course for his ship. At that point in the process, monetary policy can seem like precision engineering. But just like at sea, in monetary policy, the view is not always perfectly clear. Given what we’ve been through and continue to experience, our forecasts are not pinpoint numbers; rather, they represent ranges of likely outcomes. Likewise, our economic models are a better source of questions than answers. To make sure that such uncertainty is not just acknowledged but is actually embedded in our policy decisions, we have incorporated explicit “rule-of-thumb” ranges around the most critical variables for our projection. In doing so, we are reminding ourselves – and those who watch us – that, especially in the wake of the crisis, economic projections are subject to considerable uncertainty. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Indeed, while Canada came through the global financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession better than our G-7 peers, we are taking longer than expected – or desired – to get home. Our economy still has not returned to full capacity, and inflation has been running persistently below our 2 per cent target. Because of the unprecedented nature of the crisis and subsequent recession, the global recovery has been anything but smooth or normal. As we navigate these uncharted waters, we are especially vigilant in our lookout for risks that could push us off course. Assessing risk through two lenses This lookout is an important element of our policy deliberations. We assess how risks could interact with each other. We gauge their potential impact. And we use judgment to determine the balance among them, both today and in prospect. In fact, monetary policy formulation these days is more a process of risk management than one of precision engineering. It is important to stress that risks are not part of our baseline forecast – they are not what the Bank expects to see, but rather, they are the possible deviations from what we anticipate. We work to avoid or, at least, mitigate them. The Bank of Canada looks at risks through two lenses: (i) the possible impact on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation, and (ii) the possible impact on the stability of the financial system. These two sets of risks are related but, for the moment, let me discuss them separately. Targeting inflation is necessarily a forward-looking activity. It is informed by the work of economic forecasters who crunch the data and use models to assess the most likely future path of inflation. As our inflation target is symmetric, we care about both the upside and downside risks to inflation. Of course, when we are already below target, as we are today, we care more about downside risks than upside ones. The Bank’s projection for inflation and its assessment of the risks around that projection are published quarterly in our Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Risks to financial stability are viewed through a separate lens. The risks we consider are those that have the potential to disrupt or harm the financial system – namely, the downside, or bad, risks. Our primary objective is to determine the likelihood that they materialize and, if they were to occur, their impact on financial institutions and the functioning of markets. The Bank examines such risks in depth twice a year in our Financial System Review (FSR), the most recent of which was published just two days ago. While we examine the two sets of risks from different perspectives, we take into consideration the interplay between them. We learned, through the painful experience of the recent crisis, that pursuing economic stability without due regard for financial stability risks achieving neither. Both are necessary, but neither is sufficient. Both are central complements to each other, not substitutes. It follows naturally that, as policy-makers, we consider the risks to economic stability and financial stability in an integrated fashion. Like the two lenses of binoculars, this adds depth to our understanding of the forces at play. Avoiding Disaster Let me use a couple of examples. People ask me every day about the potential, in our present situation, for runaway inflation or runaway deflation. Indeed, sometimes the same person is worried about both! These risks sit at the extremes of the distribution of what’s possible. I’ll address each of them in turn. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Runaway inflation Let’s talk first about the risk of runaway inflation. This happened 40 years ago here in Canada and in most advanced economies. Prices spiralled up, economic growth was weak and unemployment was rising. Inflation got away from us. People’s expectations of future inflation became unanchored, pushing up actual inflation. Interest rates were also high, but savings were eroded by the high inflation. When the Bank of Canada finally made a determined effort to bring inflation back under control, our economy went through a major recession. Some wonder if today’s easy monetary policy in Canada – alongside quantitative easing in other countries – could lead to a similar outcome. Their fear is that all that money creation is eventually going to result in an explosion in inflation. They needn’t worry. The situation now is different from the early 1970s. Monetary stimulus today is offsetting the serious and still ongoing downside shocks resulting from the crisis. Of course, it is worth asking what will happen when those negative forces abate. Could all that additional liquidity fuel inflation then? My answer is: central banks will need to drain that extra liquidity from the system at some point, as the economy heals. While I don’t want to underestimate the challenge of getting that exit exactly right, I am confident that we have the ability to keep inflation from taking off. In short, we will remain vigilant. We are prepared to remove monetary stimulus when it’s no longer needed to offset the forces that currently are pulling inflation below target. But, right now, it looks to us like it will take around two years to get inflation back up to 2 per cent. Deflation Let’s switch gears and look at the risk of outright deflation. Like out-of-control inflation, deflation can become a spiral, but a downward one. Expectations become unanchored on the downside, and people put off their purchases because they expect things to be less expensive later. Demand declines with prices, while the weight of debt on the economy grows. In the Great Depression, consumer prices in Canada fell 25 per cent, and national output dropped by almost a third. The human cost was staggering, with unemployment reaching 20 per cent. A milder form of deflationary trap has nagged Japan for the past 20 years. What I am describing is an economy-wide process of deflation, which is quite different from individual prices falling because of improved competitiveness in an economy that is still growing strongly. Today, the concern is that even though policy-makers were successful in avoiding global deflation in the wake of the 2008 crisis, there is still a risk that inflation could creep down into deflationary territory as the aftershocks of this crisis persist. It is, at least in part, to counter that risk that central banks in a number of countries have kept interest rates very low and used unconventional monetary policies, such as quantitative easing, to provide additional stimulus to their economies. History has taught us that deflation usually comes in the wake of a financial crisis. This was true of the Great Depression, and of the Japanese deflation of the 1990s. Perhaps the most important lesson of the crisis, then, is that a stable financial system is necessary to keep inflation low, stable and predictable – and limit the risk of falling into a deflationary trap. The policy response – Where does financial stability come in? This is why the G-20 Leaders launched a reform agenda in 2009 to make the global financial system more robust. In short, we never want to go through this again. Since the crisis, central banks have also been focusing greater attention on financial stability issues. In fact, 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  this is a return to our roots. Many central banks were created primarily to preserve financial stability. This includes the Bank of Canada, which came into being during the Great Depression. The first line of defence against a buildup of financial imbalances is effective regulation and supervision. In Canada, it is ultimately the Minister of Finance who is responsible for the stewardship of the financial system. Regulation is carried out by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, deposit insurance by Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and consumer awareness by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The Bank of Canada’s assessment of financial stability risks is an important contribution to this team effort. It is also critical, as I mentioned earlier, to the Bank’s policy-making. Today, we are focused in particular on the risks associated with household imbalances. To explain, let me back up a bit. At the height of the crisis, although our financial system remained sound, our exports collapsed, causing a recession. To support economic growth, we have relied mainly on household spending, supported by exceptionally stimulative monetary policy. But there are trade-offs, lots of them. Today, the most obvious is that prolonged low interest rates can result in the development of imbalances in the household sector. In Canada, we have seen rising levels of household indebtedness, stretched house-price valuations and overinvestment in housing. To address these imbalances, the Finance Minister tightened mortgage insurance rules four times, among other measures, and the Superintendent of Financial Institutions introduced stronger mortgage underwriting standards for Canada’s banking institutions. In the wake of these measures, a constructive evolution of household imbalances began around the middle of last year. Growth in household borrowing has moderated, and residential investment is on a more sustainable track. Those indicators have picked up again, we think mainly because people pulled forward their plans when mortgage rates started to move up during the summer. We expect these imbalances to stabilize and then gradually unwind in coming years. In our base-case scenario, the Bank expects a soft landing in housing and a pickup in exports and investment. This rotation will relieve the tension between low demand and household imbalances. Nonetheless, the risks around this base case need to be managed. There is a risk that household imbalances could keep building and set the stage for a sharp correction down the road. Such a correction would be a risk to both the Canadian economy and our financial system. Our current monetary policy weighs this risk against the risk of inflation falling even further below target. This zone of balance is relevant today and in prospect, as we expect both risks to diminish over the next two years or so. This is what I mean when I describe monetary policy as an exercise in risk management. Credibility counts Our flexible inflation-targeting framework gives us the room to manoeuvre in the face of unusual shocks. This only works if expectations are well anchored: the public has to be confident that we will get to the 2 per cent target. Our commitment to the inflation target must remain credible. Credibility is coin. It is earned only through years of sound policy. Without it, low and stable inflation could only be achieved at considerable short-run cost to the economy – as was our experience in the early 1980s, when we tackled runaway inflation. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Credibility must be employed wisely. We think of it as an investment. By using credibility to exercise the framework’s flexibility, we are working to maintain stable financial conditions that will support the expansion of capacity and return the economy to its full potential. As the process unfolds, we anticipate there will be a future payoff of enhanced credibility. As we decide policy, we cannot take credibility for granted; we must keep earning it by ensuring, first and foremost, that monetary policy remains focused on keeping inflation on target. Conclusion Let me conclude. I’ve described how we manage a menu of risks in our policy decisions: We look at risks through two lenses. We are concerned with the big risks of runaway inflation and deflation and are acting to keep them remote. We have learned, the hard way, that financial stability is a necessary condition for low and stable inflation, and we are working here in Canada and around the world to improve the resilience of the financial system. Our current monetary policy balances the risk that inflation could drift even further below target against the risks of exacerbating financial system imbalances. As central bankers, here in Canada and globally, we are in new territory. It brings to mind the sailors of another era who were driven far off course by a nasty storm. When things calmed, they found themselves in the southern hemisphere. Suddenly the navigational chart that they relied on – the night sky – was completely different. We have every reason to believe that, after the experience of the crisis is behind us, central banking will be defined very differently than it was just five years ago. We know now that economic and financial stability are intrinsically linked, and we are figuring out as we go how to better integrate the two in our analysis and research, and in our policy. On a technical level, we are actively building new models and adding new detail to our existing ones. We are spending more time talking to real people making real economic decisions, to understand better the forces we are facing. And, we are communicating differently, not just more, but with more transparency, with due regard to the uncertainty around us. I am confident that we’ve got it roughly right, given what we know and especially what we don’t. Just like those sailors on the open seas, we will adapt and thrive – and find our way home. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Hearing before the Plenary of the European Parliament on the occasion of the adoption of the Resolution on the ECB Annual Report 2012 Introductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at a hearing before the Plenary of the European Parliament on the occasion of the adoption of the Resolution on the ECB Annual Report 2012, Strasbourg, 12 December 2013. *      *      * President, Honourable members of the European Parliament, I am very pleased to take part in this debate on the ECB Annual Report 2012. Today is the last time in this legislature that I participate in the plenary. This represents a good opportunity to take stock of the progress made over the past few years in strengthening the resilience and stability of the euro area. To introduce the debate, I would first like to review the more recent ECB’s monetary policy decisions. I will then address institutional matters of particular interest to your house as well as the progress made so far in reinforcing EMU governance. I will thereby address most of the issues which the ECON Committee highlighted in its draft resolution on the ECB Annual Report. ECB’s monetary policy Let me begin by describing the economic environment of the past years. The economic recovery that followed the post-Lehman global recession of 2008–09 was aborted in the euro area as the sovereign debt crisis took hold. Financial stability was threatened; the viability of banks that had survived the first phase of the crisis was called into question. Credit was curtailed and the recession that ensued has lasted until the first quarter of this year. Since then, we have been experiencing a weak recovery. Weak economic activity and high unemployment have resulted in a subdued inflation. Against this backdrop, and in respect of our price stability mandate that was assigned to us by the Treaty, we have lowered our key interest rates to historically low levels. To clarify the orientation of our monetary policy going forward in an exceptionally uncertain environment, we introduced forward guidance in July 2013: we stated that we expected key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. That statement was conditional and based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the real economy and subdued monetary dynamics. In November we acted upon that conditional pledge by reducing two of our key interest rates, as price pressures have diminished further and we anticipate inflation weakness to be protracted. In keeping with these anticipations, we also re-confirmed our forward guidance in its original formulation. Over the past two years our interest rate cuts were transmitted only unevenly across euro area countries, due to the fragmentation of financial markets along national borders. To address this problem, we adopted a series of non-standard measures. The purpose of these was – and remains – a more effective transmission of the ECB’s interest rate cuts, so that our monetary policy can reach euro area companies and households. Our measures addressed those distortions in sovereign debt markets that were due to the redenomination risk and alleviated funding pressures of euro area banks. At our November meeting we also decided to extend the time horizon for the application of the fixed rate full allotment procedures in our liquidity operations until at least July 2015. This decision provides our counterparties reassurance that the liquidity necessary to re-finance their core activities will be forthcoming at our main refinancing rate. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  As a direct consequence, bank lending rates for households and non-financial corporations have decreased at the euro area level. In this way, our measures have helped SMEs, too, the backbone of the euro area economy. We have, in addition, taken direct measures to alleviate the funding situation for SMEs through our collateral framework. And we have worked with the European Commission to further improve SME financing conditions. Institutional matters Let me now turn to institutional developments and focus in particular on measures related to accountability and transparency. Since our creation we have always gone beyond the Treaty requirements in making our work transparent and accessible. The monthly press conferences, which were without precedent at the time among major central banks, are a telling example. This year has also shown that the ECB stands ready to adapt its communication policy where deemed necessary. For example, we have published the procedures governing the provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA). We have started internal reflections on how to increase transparency of the deliberations in the Governing Council without undermining independent decision-making by its members. Our commitment to accountability and transparency has also become apparent in the Agreement concluded between our two institutions on the Single Supervision Mechanism (SSM). Supervision necessitates a differentiated form of accountability from monetary policy, while preserving the independence of the ECB as a whole. The Inter Institutional Agreement (IIA) strikes the right balance between ensuring high standards of accountability, transparency and safeguarding confidential information. I am confident that the implementation of the IIA will open a new chapter of successful cooperation between our two institutions. In this context let me also welcome your positive vote on Ms Nouy’s nomination. Following her final appointment by the Council, she will become your main interlocutor on all matters related to the SSM as of January 1st. I would like to also address an issue which, I know, is as much a concern to you as it is to me: the gender balance at the ECB. Today, 17% of our management positions are filled by female staff. It is clearly not enough. This is why the Executive Board decided this summer to introduce gender targets aiming at 35 % women in management positions by 2019. And this is not an empty promise. The ECB has started to implement a diversity action plan that will help us attaining those targets. Let me now share my thoughts on the process of completing EMU. Taking stock of the progress made towards a genuine EMU As this legislature comes to the end of its term, it is an opportune time to reflect on what we have achieved in such a short space of time. Not so long ago the euro area was facing an uncertain future. In the meantime, doubts about the integrity of the single currency have dissipated. Notably, a roadmap for a genuine EMU has been outlined encompassing four pillars: banking union, fiscal union, economic union and ultimately political union. Through a concerted legislative effort the euro area, and the EU as a whole, has been put on a more stable footing. Your institution has made a decisive contribution to this effort. The establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) represents probably the most significant change to the EU since the establishment of the single currency and I am happy to report the internal preparations are well underway. I strongly welcome the political agreement on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive you have reached with the Council yesterday night. Swift agreement on the other key component of Banking Union – the Single Resolution Mechanism – is of paramount importance. I trust you will succeed in adopting the relevant legislation before your term comes to an end. These institutions are essential to implement the “single rulebook” in the years to come. Looking ahead we will have a stronger set of rules 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  for capital and liquidity. We will also have a new toolbox for the resolution of financial institutions. And we will have stronger national deposit guarantee schemes. Banking Union however is not a panacea for eliminating financial market fragmentation and fully stabilising EMU. It is a necessary, but not sufficient condition to break the bank-sovereign nexus and restore sustainable economic growth. Equal borrowing conditions can only be ensured through the joint implementation of other measures. This not only includes continued fiscal consolidation and implementation of structural reforms, but also progress on the other “unions”. Only then can we say we have created a genuine EMU. Let us seize the opportunity of the next EP elections to have an open public debate on the further steps needed to strengthen the architecture of EMU. Thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Interview in Financial Times Interview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in Financial Times, conducted by Ms Claire Jones and published on 12 December 2013. *      *      * The European Central Bank has forecast inflation of 1.3 per cent in 2015, which is usually seen as the policy-relevant horizon. How can you justify not doing more now when inflation is forecast to be almost a third below your target two years from now? We aim at an inflation rate of close but below 2% over the medium term. Given the subdued outlook for prices, we are already doing a lot. We have cut rates. Since July 2012 our overnight rate has been in general lower than that controlled by any other major central bank. We have offered our forward guidance. We have extended the conduct of our main refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures full allotment until at least 7 July 2015. So, after a prolonged period of low inflation, we would expect inflation rates to return back to rates closer to 2%. However, this will take some time given the nature of the shock, namely the unwinding of real and financial imbalances, and the possibly longer than normal transmission lag of monetary policy in such an environment. But we have also said that we are ready to act again should risks to the downside materialise. What matters, in particular, is that medium to long term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Mr Draghi said last Thursday that there had been a brief discussion of negative interest rates and that any further LTRO would have to involve an extension of lending to the real economy. Are these two policies for which you feel as though you could build a strong consensus of support on the governing council should economic – or financial – conditions disappoint? What is important here is to remember that the governing council unanimously – and I’d like to emphasise this – shares the same assessment of economic conditions. There is unanimity on the outlook; the view on the economy is very much shared in the governing council. Price pressures are going to be subdued for a prolonged period of time As a result, we all agree to have an accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed. And even take more measures, if needed. That’s why we can say: we are ready to act and able to act. Under what conditions would you act? We are very well aware that price pressures are likely to remain subdued for a prolonged period of time but we expect inflation rates to converge again towards 2 per cent as the cyclical upswing of the economy takes hold. We are at the same time very conscious that, if some of the downside risks do materialise, then – because price pressures are already weak today – we would act decisively again. This view is very strongly shared by the governing council members. What are the scenarios that could lead you to act? There are a number of downside risks that we have identified. They relate to the state of the economy and downside risks to growth, a tightening of global financial conditions with undue spill-overs to the euro area, energy prices, and – last but not least – a fatigue in structural reforms in Europe. This would mean that investments do not pick up and that business confidence doesn’t improve further. For me that’s the most 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  important aspect of all – that structural reforms are being implemented so as to improve growth potential, employment opportunities and overall confidence. However, for this last downside risk, monetary policy has clearly its limits in what it can do. Another risk would be that, as a result of the comprehensive assessment, there could be some dampening effect in the short term. That risk is still fairly limited and temporary – and should be compensated for by the expansionary effects over the medium term, which will positively affect confidence in the nearer term. We will be monitoring this risk from a monetary perspective. However, this potential procyclical effect of an AQR should not lead to softening the rules of the AQR. The instruments you use to handle each scenario may depend of the nature of the shock. Each instrument has a different impact and any of the measures taken would depend on our analysis of the monetary and economic developments. Could you just say a little bit more about the possible impact of the AQR? A strong comprehensive assessment makes central bank action more effective. Monetary policy does not work as well if banks’ capital basis is thin and insufficient to support lending. In the US, you can intervene directly in the markets to transmit monetary policy stimulus, because the markets play a bigger role in financing the economy. Here, the pass-through of your monetary policy is primarily via the banks and it takes time. The comprehensive assessment should shorten the time it takes for monetary policy to impact the real economy. Indeed, it is easier for the central bank to support the economy as healthier banks tend to lend more. The worst case, to say it very bluntly, is of a central bank providing liquidity to banks just to buy or carry legacy assets, and the banking sector doesn’t restructure. This was typically the Japanese situation in the early 2000s. Perhaps paradoxically, a rigorous AQR and stress test helps monetary policy. Appropriately treating banks’ holdings of sovereign debt according to the risk that they pose to banks’ capital makes it unlikely that the banks will use central bank liquidity to excessively increase their exposure to sovereign debt. This is because banks will be wary of the constraints placed on sovereign debt by the stress tests to which they are subject at the same time. Therefore, should the procyclical impact of the AQR be significant, then monetary policy would be able to act – without hesitation and being reassured that the side effects of a liquidity injection that we have seen for the 2011–2012 operations would be minimised. So how would you assess whether the AQR was procyclical? Don’t forget we have our two pillar approach: we analyse the business cycle, but we also look at money and credit. We will see from the second pillar very quickly if the credit situation doesn’t improve. At this stage of the recovery, what we see at the moment is quite normal. The big corporate firms do not have as many constraints as the SMEs. They have around €2trn in excess cash, they can access debt markets. The reluctance to invest comes more from the business confidence side. And if you did act because of the impact of the AQR, what exactly would you do? Depending on the situation, the central bank can decide on the most effective way liquidity provision can be provided. There are no restrictions on the way a central bank provides liquidity to the banks via repo, a priori. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  You want to reach your price stability objective. At the same time, you want to be sure that when you provide liquidity against adequate collateral, it doesn’t reduce the incentive to restructure the banking sector. And so by having a well-designed comprehensive assessment – like the one we’re preparing now – we are easing the job of the central bank. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jean-Pierre Danthine: Resilience of Swiss banks from a financial stability perspective Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Vice Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 12 December 2013. *      *      * In my remarks, I would like to look at the situation at Swiss banks from a financial stability perspective, taking the big banks first and then moving on to a discussion of domestically focused banks. To close, I will say a few words on the subject of banknotes. Big banks: strengthening resilience Since the last media news conference in June, the two Swiss big banks have improved their capital situation further. This applies particularly to their risk-weighted capital ratios, where, in an international comparison, they are above the average for large global banks. Credit Suisse, for example, has already met the requirement of 13% loss-absorbing capital to risk-weighted assets, which comes into force in 2019. According to its published plans, UBS should be able to meet this target by the end of 2014. As regards total capital – which, in addition to loss-absorbing capital, also comprises low-trigger contingent capital instruments – the big banks have also made great progress; however, they have not yet achieved the ratios that will apply from 2019. Unweighted capital ratios – leverage ratios – generate a different picture. Both banks have also been able to improve their leverage ratios considerably; yet in an international comparison based on a number of commonly used definitions, they are still below the average of large global banks. As my colleague Thomas Jordan has explained, economic and financial conditions for the Swiss banking sector continue to be challenging. For this reason, it is vital for the big banks to continue improving their capitalisation, and in turn their resilience, particularly as regards the leverage ratio. This is especially important because the leverage ratio is growing in significance as a measure of bank resilience. In times of crisis, in particular, the leverage ratio often becomes the focus of market attention. In the SNB’s view, the top priority for the big banks is the consistent and rapid implementation of the “too big to fail” (TBTF) regulations. The focus should be on the following areas: First, the credibility of risk-weighted asset calculations based on banks’ internal models should be strengthened. As outlined previously, risk-weighted ratios yield a different picture of a bank’s capital situation than leverage ratios. In this context, the SNB is currently supporting FINMA in an examination of whether and to what extent risk-weighted assets based on banks’ internal models differ from those based on the standard approach, which is model-independent. If this examination reveals no substantial inexplicable differences, this would strengthen market confidence in the model-based approach. Conversely, if there are any substantial differences that cannot be explained, corrective measures would need to be considered and implemented. Such measures would also boost confidence in the model-based approach. Second, it must be ensured that, if necessary, there can be an orderly resolution of a big bank in the event of a crisis. From the Swiss perspective, the emergency plans on maintaining systemically important functions are particularly important in this regard. The emergency plans must be credible and workable in a crisis. For this reason, the big banks should continue to push forward consistently with their emergency plans. Moreover, global 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  resolution plans must ensure that the non-systemically important units of a big bank can be resolved in an orderly fashion. Adjustments to the group structure, as recently announced by both big banks, represent a first step in this process. An additional tool which can facilitate global resolution is based on the bail-in concept, which is the subject of widespread discussion at international level. With a bail-in, debt can be converted to equity capital, which would enable the big banks to carry additional losses in the event of a crisis. However, the effectiveness of a bail-in essentially depends on whether appropriate debt is available in sufficient quantities, and whether its characteristics are such as to ensure a smooth conversion into equity capital in the event of a crisis. In this regard, the authorities will have to examine the extent to which it is necessary to expand the existing TBTF regulations to take account of Swiss specificities. Domestically focused banks: resilience and lending policies I would now like to turn to the domestically focused banks. In Switzerland, there has been a further increase in risks on the mortgage and real estate markets since the end of 2012. This development poses the greatest challenge to the stability of domestically focused banks over the medium term. Conditions on the mortgage market, in particular, have deteriorated. In Switzerland, growth in mortgages for residential real estate continued to exceed GDP growth in 2013. In the first three quarters of this year, mortgage volumes increased by CHF 27 billion, or an annualised 4.4%. Over the same period, annual economic output, i.e. aggregated economic output over four quarters, rose by CHF 8.4 billion from the end of 2012, or an annualised 1.9%. This means that, for Switzerland as a whole, the already high indebtedness is continuing to grow faster than people’s capacity to offset this debt with income. The situation on the residential real estate market has also deteriorated slightly. Depending on the segment, real estate prices have risen in real terms by between 2.6% and 3.5% on average since the beginning of the year. Despite a slowing of momentum compared to last year, these growth rates are still high in a historical comparison. In addition, overall, prices for residential real estate have increased more strongly than rents or income since the beginning of the year. There is also no sign of a reversal of domestically focused banks’ risk appetite. With regard to mortgage lending for owner-occupied residential property, the proportion of new loans with high loan-to-value ratios has decreased slightly. Where affordability risks are concerned, however, no such development can be identified. Moreover, domestically focused banks remain the driving force behind the strong domestic mortgage growth. While a few individual banks have reined in their lending considerably compared to last year, others have maintained a high level of lending growth, or have even stepped up lending. Finally, interest rate risk exposure is extremely high by historical standards, whereas average interest rate margins have narrowed further over the same period. On a positive note, domestically focused banks’ capitalisation as measured by regulatory requirements remains at historically high levels. However, as discussed in this year’s Financial Stability Report, these regulatory capital ratios could be overstating the banks’ resilience, because the major risks prevailing in the mortgage and real estate markets or the interest rate risk exposure are not, or only partly, taken into account. Against this backdrop, banks should – irrespective of the regulatory requirements – continuously assess their resilience, and make adjustments where necessary. They should be able to maintain their economically important functions, even if real estate prices were to fall sharply and interest rates were to simultaneously rise. Over the last few years, a number of measures have been taken to reduce the risks to financial stability arising out of developments in the mortgage and real estate markets. The most recent of these measures is the activation, in February this year, of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB). These measures were necessary and useful. For example, this year a 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  few large domestically focused banks – citing, among other reasons, the activation of the CCB – have taken steps to strengthen their capital and thereby their resilience. So far, however, the package of measures has not been enough to prevent a further build-up of imbalances on the mortgage and real estate markets. In an environment of persistently low interest rates, coupled with banks’ undiminished appetite for risk, the danger of a further build-up of imbalances remains considerable. For this reason, the SNB continues to monitor the situation very closely, and regularly assesses whether the CCB should be adjusted. Supply of secure banknotes ensured at all times Now I would like to say a few words on the subject of banknotes. At the beginning of October, we informed the public that, since autumn 2012, a small number of Swiss 1000-franc banknotes have been in circulation which were not issued by the SNB. As you know, these notes were abstracted during the production process at Orell Füssli, before they had been through all stages of production. Out of consideration for the investigation by the Office of the Attorney General, this information was only made public after some of these notes appeared in Switzerland. As previously announced, those in possession of such banknotes will be reimbursed the nominal value by Orell Füssli. For the SNB, security is paramount in the production of banknotes. Orell Füssli has reviewed its security arrangements, and has taken the necessary measures to ensure that such events are precluded to the greatest possible extent in the future. I would like to emphasise that the SNB and Orell Füssli have been working together in the area of banknote production for about a century. The supply of secure banknotes for our country has been, and will continue to be, guaranteed at all times. We will also be pursuing the development of the new banknote series in close collaboration with Orell Füssli. As you are aware, the new banknote series has suffered a series of delays. The SNB is committed to putting banknotes into circulation that are state of the art in terms of both design innovation and technology. Our current banknote series was unique in this respect when it was issued in the mid-1990s. And it still has a very high security standard today, as a result of this commitment to quality. This means that the SNB is not under any pressure to roll out a new banknote series quickly. The new series must meet very high security, quality and technical production standards – and will have to do so for at least 15 years after its first release. So it is worth taking the time to ensure that the new security features, which are complex, technologically innovative and have never before been applied to banknote design, can also stand up to the rigours of industrial production processes. A number of tests are currently being carried out. The first denomination in the new series – the 50-franc note – will not be issued until 2015 at the earliest. We will announce the exact issue date as soon as production of the first banknote denomination has been completed.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ben S Bernanke: Concluding remarks at the Ceremony commemorating the Centennial of the Federal Reserve Act Concluding remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Ceremony commemorating the Centennial of the Federal Reserve Act, Washington DC, 16 December 2013. *      *      * I have been asked to close this ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Federal Reserve Act – the law that created the Federal Reserve – by looking ahead to the next century. Given the well-known difficulties that economists have in forecasting even the next few quarters, I will happily point out one important advantage in making a 100-year forecast, which is that I won’t be around to explain why the forecast went wrong. Our ability to make accurate long-term forecasts is limited, to say the least. Nevertheless, I will venture one prediction that I don’t think is too bold, which is this: The values that have sustained and served the Federal Reserve at its best, and have permitted it to make critical contributions to the economic health of our nation during the past century, will continue to serve it and the nation well in the century ahead. Among the Fed’s most important values is the belief that policymaking should be based on dispassionate, objective, and fact-based analysis. The ideal we seek is a combination of the researcher’s intellectual rigor and the ability of the effective policymaker to navigate the messiness of the real world, a world that includes complex institutions and markets, imperfect and incomplete data, and often-unpredictable human behavior. Of course, policy analysis and implementation of the highest quality do not just happen. They require professionalism and a commitment to public service as exemplified by the generations of staff members who have served this institution so well. Without the expertise and creativity embodied in the staff, it would have been impossible to develop the innovative policies required to meet, in the words of the Federal Reserve Act, the “unusual and exigent circumstances” we confronted during the recent financial crisis. If there is one thing on which I believe all of us here can agree, it is that the quality of the staff has been a great strength throughout our institution’s history. Maintaining that quality and commitment to public service will be essential if the Fed is to have a successful second century. Dispassionate analysis, expertise, and commitment to public service – all are values that have served us well. But one value that strikes me as having been at least as important as any other has been the Federal Reserve’s willingness, during its finest hours, to stand up to political pressure and make tough but necessary decisions. The fight against inflation during Paul and Alan's times in office was critical for the nation’s longer-term prosperity, and it required perseverance in the face of heavy criticism. I keep in my office one of the 2-by-4s mailed to the Fed during Paul’s tenure, which communicates some distinctly unfavorable views of high interest rates and their effects. More recently, of course, the Federal Reserve took controversial but necessary measures to arrest what was arguably the worst financial crisis in American history, helping to avert what likely would have been a much more severe economic downturn than the Great Recession we did experience. We have been able to respond nimbly to economic emergencies and make difficult choices in part because of our institutional structure – including long terms for members of the Board of Governors and diverse regional representation in our policymaking Committee – and because of the willingness of policymakers, past and present, to do whatever was needed in the longer-run interest of the economy. As an institution, the Federal Reserve must continue to be willing to make tough decisions, based on objective, empirical analysis and without regard to political pressure. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  But, finally, we must also recognize that the Fed’s ability to make and implement such decisions ultimately depends on the public’s understanding and acceptance of our actions. For this reason, we must continue to emphasize two other essential values – transparency and accountability. We must do all that we can to explain our actions and to show how they serve the public interest. That’s why we must welcome communication, broadly defined. Of course, we will continue to talk to economists and market participants, but that is not enough. Ultimately, the legitimacy of our policies rests on the understanding and support of the broader American public, whose interests we are working to serve. The ability of this institution to support a healthy economy – an economy with high levels of employment, low inflation, and a stable financial system – will require our continued efforts to engage in two-way communication – explaining our actions and, importantly, listening to what our fellow citizens have to say. Let me end by thanking the organizers of this event and, in particular, all of the past and present policymakers in attendance for helping us mark this centennial milestone in such a memorable fashion. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Haruhiko Kuroda: Overcoming deflation and after Speech by Mr Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Meeting of Councillors of Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), Tokyo, 25 December 2013. *      *      * Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. Original presentation is on the Bank of Japan’s website: www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/press/koen_2013/ko131225a.htm/ Introduction It is a great honor to have this opportunity to address such a distinguished gathering of business leaders in Japan today. There is only one week left this year. As for Japan’s economy this year, it has been following a recovery path as expected, due partly to the effects of both monetary and fiscal policies (Chart 1). During the three quarters after the turn of the year, real GDP registered an average annualized growth rate of 3 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which was substantially above the potential growth rate that is estimated to be around 0.5 percent. Business sentiment in the Tankan survey (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) released last week has continued to show a clear improvement and, on an all industry and all-sized enterprise basis, it has gotten back to the level of a peak prior to the Lehman crisis. There has also been an improvement on the price front this year (Chart 2). The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items excluding fresh food) turned positive in June, increased to 0.9 percent in October, and is likely to slightly exceed 1 percent by the end of the year. Not only a rise in the prices of energy-related goods, including petroleum products, has contributed to raise the index, but also an improvement has been spreading in a wide range of items as the aggregate supply and demand balance of the economy has been improving. That can be confirmed by the fact that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items excluding food and energy) turned positive at 0.3 percent in October, the highest rate of increase in 15 years since August 1998. The Bank of Japan, with the aim of overcoming deflation at the earliest possible time, introduced quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in April this year. Today, toward the year-end, I will express my views on what kind of economy and society we aim at by overcoming deflation while looking back at the developments in Japan’s economy from a medium- to long-term perspective. I. The problem of deflation The word “deflation” is generally understood as referring to a state in which prices decline persistently. Since the latter half of the 1990s, Japan’s economy has been in deflation for nearly 15 years (Chart 3). During that period, Japan’s economy was caught in various negative shocks: the nonperforming loan problem and the Asian currency crisis in the latter half of the 1990s, and a burst of an IT bubble in the United States, the Lehman crisis, and the Great East Japan Earthquake after the turn of the 2000s. In addition, there were many factors that put direct downward pressure on prices, such as an inflow of inexpensive import goods from emerging economies, firms’ low-price strategy amid intensified competition associated with deregulation, and reduction in the wage level due to an increasing use of non-regular employment. While it is not easy to specify the causes of deflation, what is important is that deflation was not only a result of economic stagnation but also a cause that protracted economic stagnation. Namely, amid nearly 15 years of deflation, behavior based on 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  recognition that “prices would not rise” or “prices would moderately decline” has been embedded in the economy. Let me explain somewhat in detail about that point. Viewed from firms’ side, under deflation, as they cannot raise the prices of their products and services, their sales will not increase and profits will hardly increase. Therefore, firms will restrain labor costs and business fixed investment as much as possible. For households, as wages will not increase, consumption will be restrained. In addition, if future prices are to decline, they will become more inclined to defer consumption as much as possible. They will be better off if they buy after prices decline. If consumption is restrained in such a manner, firms will be forced to reduce the prices of their products and services. As a result, a vicious cycle of a decline in prices, a decrease in sales and profits, a restraint in wages, a slump in consumption, and a decline in prices will continue. What is important here is that both firms and households are acting rationally as respective economic entities. Notwithstanding each entity taking action considered rational, it leads to a bad result as a whole: that state is called a “fallacy of composition” or a “coordination failure” in terms in economics. Japan’s deflation since the latter half of the 1990s is a typical example of that. Let us confirm that point in terms of macroeconomic indicators since the 1990s. Nominal GDP and nominal employee income have not been able to get out of the long-term downtrend since their peaks in 1997 (Chart 4). Namely, amid deflation, Japan’s economic activity on a nominal basis has been consistently contracting. Such situation is quite rare among advanced economies. In the United States, nominal GDP and nominal employee income have maintained long-term growth trends, albeit a temporary decline due to the Lehman crisis. Japanese firms have been in a situation in which they have not been able to pass the costs related to production on to sale prices because of intensified competition (Chart 5). As for price conditions in the Tankan survey, since the latter half of the 1990s, the diffusion index of output prices has been consistently lower than that of input prices. As a reason for the difficulty in price pass-through, many firms have pointed out severity in price competition with rival firms, thus suggesting that the “fallacy of composition” or the “coordination failure” might have been taking place. At the same time, firms’ medium- to long-term growth expectations have been on a declining trend for a protracted period since the 1990s (Chart 6). Furthermore, the fact that the expected growth rate on a nominal basis was lower than that on a real basis even when corporate profits increased substantially in the mid-2000s tells us how persistent deflationary expectations were. Also viewed from the financial side, protracted deflation has deprived Japan’s economy of vitality. First, when deflationary expectations were embedded, real interest rates obtained by subtracting the expected rates of inflation from nominal interest rates remained high (Chart 7). What matters for firms’ decision-making in business fixed investment is developments in not nominal but real interest rates. Even though nominal interest rates decline, if prices are expected to decline as a trend, investment cost on a real basis will remain high and incentive for business fixed investment will wane. In order for firms to transform innovative ideas into actual technologies and products, it is necessary to introduce new machines and build new factories. The fact that real interest rates remained high amid deflation has deprived firms of incentive to make growth-enhancing investment. Second, when deflationary expectations were embedded, holding cash and deposits became a relatively better investment even if nominal interest rates were zero or at extremely low levels (Chart 8). Deflation reduced the rate of return on risk assets such as stocks and investment trusts on the one hand, but on the other increased the real rate of return on cash and deposits, whose principals are guaranteed. Against such a backdrop and due partly to investors’ long-standing preference toward safe assets, risk money backed by investors’ search for high returns was lacking in Japan’s financial market, and that weakened the power to support firms’ growth from the financial side. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  An aggregate flow of funds has substantially changed from the past amid a vicious cycle of deflation. The corporate sector had long been a “fund shortage” sector, in which investment exceeds savings, up to the first half of the 1990s. Firms’ innovations are a source of economic growth, and it is a normal state of the economy in which the corporate sector raises funds, conducts business fixed investment, and makes research and development investment. However, since the latter half of the 1990s, the corporate sector drastically changed to a “fund surplus” sector, in which savings chronically exceed investment. And firms have channeled most of their savings accumulated every year to relatively safe and better investment tools of cash and deposits (Chart 9). Viewed from the banking sector, that means an increase in the liability of deposits on the balance sheet, and, as firms’ appetite for business fixed investment remained stagnant, the banking sector could not easily increase its asset side of lending. Therefore, the banking sector has increased investment in Japanese government bonds (JGBs), which generates safe and certain returns even with low nominal interest rates (Chart 10). In the meantime, the government sector has been running substantial fiscal deficits due to a decline in tax revenue and repeated implementation of an economic stimulus and to an increase in the social security burden stemming from a declining and aging population. Consequently, government debt outstanding has continued to rise, but JGBs were issued smoothly, supported by buoyant demand from the banking sector. As deflation became protracted, a mechanism based on the assumption that prices will not increase has been embedded in Japan’s economic and social system. As I have mentioned earlier, each economic entity has been acting rationally and has been lacking incentive to change its behavioral pattern. In that sense, deflation has been in a state of equilibrium. That is why it has been also called “deflationary equilibrium.” It can be said that deflationary equilibrium has become protracted and become increasingly difficult to overcome precisely because it has been stable. However, such state of equilibrium will not continue forever. Above all, one cannot expect the long-term development of Japan’s economy in the absence of firms’ active efforts to create new businesses. For the sake of the future of Japan’s economy, it is critical to overcome deflation at the earliest possible time and convert “bad and shrinking equilibrium” to “good and expanding equilibrium.” II. Ideas behind QQE – drastic change in expectations Then, how can the economy overcome deflation? The Bank’s answer to this question was nothing but the QQE introduced in April. As mentioned earlier, the essence of deflation is in that taking action on the assumption that prices will not increase has been rational for both firms and households. To get out of such “deflationary equilibrium,” the economic environment needs to be changed so that taking action on the assumption that prices will moderately increase becomes a better option. Under deflation due to a “fallacy of composition,” raising prices and wages by only one firm will be a disadvantage. As many firms raising prices and wages simultaneously will have a positive effect on the economy as a whole, the policy authorities have to come up with bold policy measures that enable firms to change their mindset in such a manner. In sum, there is a need to change the rules of the game that prevailed in the “deflationary equilibrium.” To that end, the Bank is strongly and clearly committed to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent CPI inflation rate at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years. Besides, to underpin the strong and clear commitment, the Bank has decided to enter a new phase of bold monetary easing both in terms of quantity and quality (Chart 11). Furthermore, the Bank is also committed to continuing with the QQE as long as it is necessary to maintain the 2 percent target in a stable manner. In the process, the Bank will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make appropriate adjustments. The Bank is totally committed to achieving the 2 percent price stability target. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  As specific measures for monetary easing, the Bank will purchase JGBs so that their holdings will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen, and double the monetary base in two years (Chart 12). The monetary base two years later will reach about 60 percent of nominal GDP. That size far exceeds that of the current 22 percent at the Federal Reserve (Fed) in the United States and 22 percent at the Bank of England in the United Kingdom, and thus the QQE is truly unprecedented monetary easing in modern history. The QQE anticipates various transmission channels, and what differs greatly from the Bank’s past monetary easing policies and the current monetary easing policies pursued by major central banks overseas is a particular focus on “a drastic change in expectations.” The QQE aims at, through strong and clear commitment and monetary easing that underpins the commitment, drastically changing the market’s and economic entities’ expectations, thereby working directly on raising inflation expectations. If inflation expectations rise and a recognition that prices will rise in the future becomes embedded, stimulative effects through channels such as a decline in real interest rates and portfolio rebalancing will be strengthened. Namely, first, the Bank’s purchases of JGBs put downward pressure on nominal long-term interest rates through directly influencing the supply and demand conditions of JGBs, and if a rise in inflation expectations is added to that, real long-term interest rates will further decline, thereby strengthening the effect of stimulating investment. Second, if inflation expectations rise, the relative attractiveness of holding cash and deposits will decline and thus it is expected that investors and financial institutions will shift their investment to risk assets such as stocks and foreign bonds or increase lending. Transmission channels of the effect of the QQE that focuses on influencing expectations are nothing but a process of reversing the vicious cycle embedded under deflation. Starting from dispelling deflationary expectations, the Bank aims at creating and embedding an economic virtuous cycle of a moderate rise in prices, an increase in sales and profits, an increase in wages, a boost in consumption, and a moderate rise in prices. III. Raising inflation expectations While the QQE focuses on raising inflation expectations, it seems that there have still been skeptical views among market participants and economists about the feasibility of raising inflation expectations through policy measures. To begin with, we are thoroughly aware that a central bank cannot change at will people’s and the market’s expectations. Having said that, here, I would like to make two points. First, looking at history, while there were not many cases in which people’s inflation expectations shifted dramatically in a short period, those cases were underpinned by a bold policy regime change being implemented based on the policy authorities’ strong resolution. For example, in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s, President Roosevelt clearly showed his strong resolution toward overcoming deflation and implemented the New Deal Policy (Chart 13). By that, inflation expectations shifted upward in a relatively short period, and severe deflation associated with the Great Depression was contained. Also in Japan during the same period, a combination of expansionary foreign exchange, fiscal, and monetary policies, the so-called Takahashi Economic Policy, achieved a significant result in overcoming the Showa Depression. While it is an example of containing inflation, it is well known that Fed Chairman Paul Volcker succeeded in lowering inflation expectations through aggressive monetary tightening from the end of the 1970s to the beginning of the 1980s, and laid a sound foundation for prosperity of the U.S. economy under low inflation (Chart 13). Second, in formulating inflation expectations, what is important is not only a forward-looking element, which is the Bank’s commitment and actions, but also an adaptive or backward-looking element, which is an accumulation of achievements that the actual inflation rate increases as monetary easing progresses. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI increased to 0.9 percent in October and is expected to hover at slightly above 1 percent 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  through the first half of 2014. Given that deflation has continued for nearly 15 years, those are important changes. If people actually experience a rise in prices, inflation expectations are supposed to change substantially. The Bank holds the view that, due to a backward-looking element together with a forward-looking element, inflation expectations will continue on a rising trend, gradually converging to around 2 percent – the price stability target. While I have said that prices are expected to rise gradually, the Bank has been aiming at ensuring price stability and not by any means artificially creating inflation. A numerical definition of what the Bank considers price stability based on a specific price index is 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. There are several reasons why 2 percent might be desirable. First, the existence of upward bias that an inflation rate calculated from the CPI will become higher than the true inflation rate. In other words, when the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is 0 percent, that situation is in deflation to the extent of the bias. Therefore, to overcome deflation, it is necessary to aim at a somewhat positive inflation rate. Second, the idea of securing a “buffer” to reinforce monetary policy in responding to a price decline and economic deterioration. Nominal interest rates cannot be lowered to below zero percent. Since lowered to 0.5 percent in 1995, the short-term rate in Japan has been between 0 percent and 0.5 percent for about 20 years (Chart 14). Japan has been in a situation in which it has been difficult to stimulate economic activity by lowering nominal short-term interest rates even if prices decline or economic activity deteriorates. In fact, even in response to an extremely large adverse shock of the Lehman crisis, the Bank was only able to reduce about 0.4 percent of the nominal short-term interest rate. In the future, when about 2 percent inflation will be achieved in a stable manner and nominal interest rates will be formed at a somewhat high level reflecting the inflation rate, room will increase for flexibly responding to a price decline and economic deterioration by reducing the short-term interest rate. For similar reasons, many countries have set an inflation target at about 2 percent, and 2 percent has become a global standard. Concluding remarks As I have explained, the Bank has been aiming at creating a state in which 2 percent inflation rate will be maintained in a stable manner. It might be difficult to imagine such a situation because deflation has continued for a protracted period. I would like to conclude my speech today by briefly touching on an image of the economy and society after overcoming deflation. A state in which 2 percent inflation will be maintained in a stable manner is, to put it briefly, a state that each economic entity will act based on a recognition that prices will rise by about 2 percent even when the economy is in a normal state. In other words, a state in which about 2 percent inflation has been factored in price-setting and wage-setting. Such state has already been achieved in advanced economies such as in the United Stated and Europe, in which people’s medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been stable at about 2 percent. As about 2 percent inflation has been firmly embedded in the social system and practices, those economies have been able to avoid deflation of a continued decline in prices and wages even when there was temporary downward pressure on prices and wages due to economic deterioration. Let me cite one unique example. In wage negotiations between employees and employers in Sweden, a mechanism that the 2 percent inflation target set by the central bank serves as an important starting point for discussion to determine the wage increase rate was established as a common practice (Chart 15). In fact, in Sweden, as wages rise stably, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been around 2 percent over the business cycle. Japan’s economy is now seeing a wide range of positive developments in the real economy and the financial market, as well as an improvement in people’s mindset and expectations. It is a golden opportunity for overcoming deflation. Let me reiterate that the Bank is committed to pursuing the QQE and achieving the 2 percent price stability target at the earliest possible 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  time. I strongly expect that the favorable moves to achieve an economic virtuous cycle will spread in business and industrial circles. Thank you.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andrew G Haldane: The Commercial Property Forum twenty years on Remarks by Mr Andrew G Haldane, Executive Director, Financial Stability, Bank of England, at the Bank of England, London, 18 December 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank Oliver Burrows, Iain de Weymarn, David Gregory, David Learmonth, Varun Paul, Rhys Phillips, Laura Piscitelli, Martin Taylor and Jack Worlidge for their help and comments. Tonight marks an important birthday. We are here to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Bank’s Commercial Property Forum. I am delighted to welcome members, past and present, back to the Bank. The Forum met for the first time on 28th July 1993. It was hosted by my predecessor Pen Kent. Its aim, to use Pen’s words at the time, was “to bring all sides of industry together” – developers, investors, lenders, occupiers, surveyors, auctioneers, researchers and regulators – to discuss developments in the commercial property sector. Since then, the Forum has met around 80 times. It has done so under three external chairmen – Clive Lewis, Chris Bartram and Ian Marcus – and I am particularly grateful to them for their efforts over the past 20 years. The Forum has drawn on around 300 experts from across various sectors. By my reckoning, they have drunk over 1500 cups of tea or coffee and eaten over 2000 biscuits. I cannot think of a Bank committee whose caffeine and calorific intake could surpass the Forum’s. That twenty year period has been far from a quiet one, for the Bank or the commercial property industry. The Bank gained operational independence for monetary policy through the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in 1997; had its role in supervising individual firms first stripped from it in 1998 and then, earlier this year, re-instated through the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA); and, most recently, has taken on responsibility for so-called macro-prudential regulation through the new Financial Policy Committee (FPC). The commercial property industry’s fortunes have been just as undulating. But throughout those ups and downs, the Forum has remained a key source of intelligence for the Bank and the industry and an important sign of cooperation between the Bank and the industry. Since 1997, the Forum has helped inform the deliberations of the MPC and, over the past few years, the PRA and FPC. And it was the success of the Forum that led me, three years ago, to set up a parallel Residential Property Forum, chaired by Nick Ritblat. Some of you will have heard me say that the Forum is one of the best meetings I attend at the Bank. And I know some of you, on hearing that, have been left wondering just what my other meetings must be like. Speaking on behalf of the Bank, I wanted to say how grateful we are to you all for those contributions. But what has the Forum achieved during its life? And, looking forward, what could it achieve in future? Cycles of the past Let me start with the bad news. The Forum has assuredly not solved the problem of boom and bust in the commercial property market. Indeed, the environment today – slow recovery from a jarring commercial property bust – is eerily reminiscent of the situation twenty years ago when the Forum began. As Yogi Berra reportedly said, it is a case of déjà vu all over again. The Forum was born out of the commercial property crash of the early 1990s. Between 1989 and 1993, UK commercial property prices fell by 27%. This followed a long period of rising prices, high liquidity, expansive lending and weakening credit standards. These ingredients combined to create a classic pro-cyclical spiral. Higher valuations supported ever-larger 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  loans on ever-finer terms, boosting valuations still further. When that pro-cyclical spiral went into reverse, it left banks, developers and investors all licking their wounds. Today, the situation is much the same. Commercial property prices are 37% below their peak. For secondary properties, they are more like 50% below their peak. This fall-to-earth came after a long wave of rising commercial property prices, deeper liquidity and rapid and, in many cases, imprudent lending practices. The subsequent crash has left banks, developers and investors not just licking their wounds but in some cases requiring life support. The commercial property bust has contributed to several UK banks departing the high street and the economy suffering its most painful contraction since at least the 1930s. This pro-cyclical, boom-bust pattern is, of course, neither new nor UK-specific. Over the past century, the UK commercial property market has experienced five distinct boom-bust cycles (Chart 1): in the 1930s, the 1950s, the 1970s, the 1990s and then again in this century. Peak-to-trough, the average price decline was 26%. The commercial property cycle appears to be every bit as regular as the business cycle, but with one key difference: its amplitude is perhaps three times greater. That pattern is replicated internationally. During this crisis, commercial property prices fell by 22% in Japan, 29% in Spain, 34% in the US and 67% in Ireland. Earlier, commercial property lay at the heart of the UK secondary banking crisis of the 1970s, the US Savings and Loans crisis of the 1980s, the Japanese and Scandinavian financial meltdowns of the early 1990s and the Asian banking crises of the late 1990s. During those crises, commercial property prices fell, on average, by around 40% and often by much more. The costs to the wider economy of these boom-bust cycles have been even more striking. Recessions that are accompanied by a property bust come with a much higher price tag. The cumulative loss of output from a residential property-related recession, for example, is around three times greater than a plain-vanilla recession at around 10% of initial GDP. Its duration is also around a third longer. It may not be an over-statement to say that, historically, commercial property has probably been the most pro-cyclical sector on the planet. It has probably contributed more to financial crises, and associated output and job losses, than any other area of industry, outside of banking. This is all sobering context. Cycles of the future That naturally begs the question of what can be done to avert a next time? And what role, if any, the Forum might play? I think there are some positive developments to report. These hold out the prospect – no more than that – that next time could be different. But to be successful, these measures will need both industry and regulators to act decisively and in concert. Let’s start with industry. It is clear to me from the Forum’s deliberations that the industry itself understands the need for change. That was brought home when a group of Forum members came together earlier this year, under the chairmanship of Nick Scarles, to produce “A Vision for Real Estate Finance in the UK”. This was published in October. The recommendations in this report make eminent sense. For example, they include proposals to improve loan-level commercial real estate data. This would improve monitoring of aggregate exposures to the sector and modelling of real estate risk. The recommendation that caught my eye related to valuation. Valuation lies at the heart of the pro-cyclical spirals we have seen historically in the commercial property market. Peaky valuations can give the appearance of a safety margin for lenders, causing them to loosen their grip on credit conditions, thus driving valuations higher still. Chart 2 illustrates this spiral in the UK. Valuations lead lending by around a year, with a correlation coefficient of around 0.75. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  One way of slowing that pro-cyclical spiral would be to base lending decisions not on spot, but on medium-term or sustainable valuations. Any ramping-up of property prices above their sustainable value would not then automatically give the appearance of safety and thereby encourage looser credit conditions. That, in a nutshell, is the aim of the recommendation in the “Vision” document. Needless to say, there is further work to be done by the industry to make these proposals operational. The very first minutes of the Forum highlighted property statistics and valuations as two areas where greatest improvement was needed. Twenty years on, that remains the case today. A continued effort will be needed by the industry to complete the job. Next, regulators. For much of the period prior to the financial crisis, credit and asset price cycles were only of interest to policymakers to the extent they posed a direct risk to inflation targets or to the solvency of individual firms. Were a bubble to blow, then the most likely response was a combination of benign neglect on the upswing and lower interest rates in the downswing. The role of policy was to “mop” after the flood. That orthodoxy has been sunk by the crisis. After perhaps the largest credit boom in human history, central banks globally are still frantically mopping with unprecedented degrees of monetary stimulus. Yet even that was insufficient to save the world economy from the “Great Recession”. And the recovery from recession has been both slower and lower than almost anyone expected. Neglect of the credit cycle has shown itself to be anything but benign. The lesson from all of this is very clear. As policymakers we must do a much better job of taking prompt corrective action to lean against financial swings which, if allowed to persist, would otherwise put at risk the financial system and wider economy. We need to build defences to protect against the collateral damage from financial flood. We need to be popping, not mopping. Fortunately, that is exactly what is now happening. Regulators globally are pursuing a wholly new approach. It goes by the name of macro-prudential policy. And here in the UK, it is the responsibility of the Bank’s new Financial Policy Committee (FPC). Among the FPC’s tasks is to lean against pro-cyclicality in the financial system. That means smoothing out the stomach-churning highs and lows in the credit and asset price cycle, which have characterised the past. As evidence of this approach, consider the FPC’s recent actions in the UK residential property market. This market has defrosted at pace over the past twelve months. The financial stability risks from this re-heating may not be immediate, but nor are they hypothetical. Take the position of UK households. Despite some post-crisis deleveraging households’ debt burden, relative to income, remains high at around 140% – almost three times its level in 1980. As long as house prices rise faster than wages, as they have during the course of this year, this upward creep in households’ debt burden will continue. And the higher this debt burden, the more sensitive will household spending be to any eventual upwards adjustment in mortgage rates. In some ways more important from a financial stability perspective is the distribution of mortgage debt. Households representing almost 20% of this debt have a debt-to-income multiple above 5 – that is, around 1 million households. Around a third of debt, or around 1.6 million households, is owed by those with a debt-to-income multiple above 4. Just over a quarter of this debt is owed by households with £300 or less in monthly disposable income after essential expenditure is taken into account. And just over a half of all UK households say they would need to take corrective action (cutting spending, working longer hours etc) if mortgage rates were to rise by as little as 2.5 percentage points, if income were unchanged. None of this is to suggest an immediate problem, especially with interest rates so low. But financial stability is about protecting against future tail risks. It was against this backdrop that the authorities recently decided to reduce some of the stimulus being provided to mortgage lending – for example, stimulus provided by regulatory capital relief and the Bank’s Funding for Lending Scheme. As importantly, however, the FPC also set out its stall on what other 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  macro-prudential measures could be taken to slow the accumulation of credit and debt, if these at some point put the financial system or economy at risk. While this combination of measures may have appeared modest, they represent a big philosophical shift from the past and an important signal for the future. Regulators, certainly here in the UK, have clearly signposted they are no longer willing to turn a blind eye to pro-cyclical swings in property, or any other sector, which risk tripping up the economy. We can no more eliminate the credit cycle than we can the business cycle. But can we do better than watch on in horror, mop in hand? We can and we must. The virtue of having this second set of instruments is well illustrated in the current environment. Macro-prudential measures can help guard against the financial stability risks otherwise associated with extra-ordinarily loose monetary policy. In the UK, the FPC can help support monetary policy in its task of driving forward recovery in the economy, by avoiding the MPC having to look over their shoulders for fast-approaching financial stability risks. In situations like these, two arms – monetary and macro-prudential policy – are surely better than one in securing macro-economic and financial stability. And having both arms attached to a single body, as here in the UK, can in turn help achieve greater coordination between monetary and macro-prudential policies. There is a quiet revolution underway in the UK’s macro-economic policy framework. Conclusions On its 20th birthday, it is clear that the Commercial Property Forum has never been more important. The boom-bust cycle in the sector is simply too damaging to be left to free-wheel. It is high time to develop some properly functioning gears and brakes. That is now being done, as a shared effort between the industry and the authorities – in Pen’s words, “to bring all sides of the industry together”. If this is successful, the Forum could not ask for a better birthday present.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Interview in La Stampa Interview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in La Stampa, published on 22 December 2013. *      *      * Draghi said recently that for the AQR the sovereign bonds will be treated as neutral, but that they will be considered as a risky asset for the stress test. What could it mean for Italian banks? “I can’t comment on this, as even the parameter have not been decided, yet and the stress test will be a joint exercise with the European Banking Authority (EBA). What I can say is that, in general, banks have to manage their risks. The stress test by definition stresses the entire portfolio of the banks, thus including sovereign debt”.  Don’t you think that the OMT should also change your perspective, when you judge government bonds detained by banks? “I would not link the two things. The OMT has obviously had a consequence on the pricing of sovereign bonds, to the extent that it has removed from the spread that certain governments have to pay the compensation for the probability that a “catastrophic risk” scenario may materialise: the probability that they may leave the euro area. Stress tests are never made for dealing with “end-of-the world” scenarios, but with plausible events, as adverse as they can be”.  The ECB mentioned the possibility of a conditioned LTRO, “British style”, a “funding for lending” LTRO, but what are you exactly thinking of?  “It is clear that when a central bank provides liquidity to the banking sector, it expects the banking sector to transmit the liquidity stimulus, in volume and in prices, to the economy. But on the other hand you cannot really force the banks to lend to the real economy when there is a problem on the demand side, when the perceived risk that banks attach to a loan is simply too high. You also don’t want that the liquidity injections lead the banks to take excessive risks elsewhere. Analysts often mention sovereigns, but I am not thinking only about that. I think, as also Draghi said, that putting “conditions” on LTRO is complicated for all these reasons. For me the essential is to analyse if and how risks are properly priced and managed by banks”.  How’s the situation in the credit market? “On lending to the real economy, what in particular needs to be addressed is the issue about the lending to small and medium enterprises. Recently, we have some positive signs in the evolution of lending. The contraction of lending to non-financial corporation has been 2.9% in the 12 months to October. This had been falling consistently, but in the most recent period the flows of new loans, while remaining negative, have shown signs of stabilisation compared to the earlier part of the year. You have also to take into account that bank lending is in some cases only part of the total financing of a company. Large firms for example tend to borrow directly on capital markets, issuing corporate bonds, and this market for corporate bonds have been doing very well in terms of prices and new volumes. We also see that, on their asset side, euro area firms have accumulated more than two trillions in liquid assets, largely reflecting precautionary savings and reluctance to invest. As profits have been falling, distribution of income to the shareholders and owners has been cut. Large size corporations are better placed here than the smaller firms, particularly in countries like Italy” 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  How can we address this problem? “In contrast to most other countries in the euro area, in Italy, you have a marked dual industrial structure: on the one hand there are many very small firms, and the other hand a rather small number of large and very large firms. This is important because credit supply constraints are particularly severe for the smallest firms, which are the first to suffer when banks contract lending”.  But what would you suggest? “Italy has taken some measures that have improved the situation, like the moratoria, which make credit conditions a bit easier, but you still have long-standing and severe structural issues to solve. You don’t escape the big question: it’s a structural problem and Italy has to make economic reforms. During the crisis Italy has done a lot in terms of correcting its fiscal weaknesses, but has not done enough in terms of economic reforms. The labour market, still needs more flexibility. Labour market legislation needs to facilitate – not hinder – the capacity of businesses to deploy their labour force in the most efficient manner. More generally, competitiveness and the attractiveness of a country as a foreign direct investment destination depends on the “easiness to do business”, on its bureaucratic environment, on its judicial system’s capacity to enforce the rule of law, on the country’s governance in general. Without good economic governance solidly in place, you cannot expect foreign investment to return to Italy. If you look at the last “Doing business” index of competitiveness, Italy is again extremely badly placed”. So “easiness to do business” comes from labour legislation and, more in general, from laws and bureaucracy. But what else should be changed? “Also, unit labour costs are too high. This does not mean, of course, that salaries are too high in absolute terms, in fact the take-home pay is low in Italy on average in international comparison. Unit labour costs are high because productivity growth has been too low in Italy. But salaries cannot increase unless productivity increases, and productivity cannot increase unless the overall level of competitiveness of the country improves dramatically. Among the countries where sovereign bonds have been under pressure, Italy is the only one where labour cost competitiveness is not improving relative to the best performers in the euro area. This is a concern, also for growth perspective. You see, Italy is a country with a fantastic human capital, some of the best universities, a lot of creativity and cultural richness. But more worrisome is the difficulty of society to work together, to come to agreed long-term solutions, to redress its governance. It seems to me that this is really the biggest issue”.  How is the situation in public finances, in your opinion? “While still increasing, the public debt level is on a better medium term trajectory thanks to reduced annual fiscal deficits . To keep public debt on a sustainable path, it is essential that the government sticks to its fiscal commitments. This means that fiscal efforts cannot be relaxed. For example: to have a debt/gdp ratio of 100% in 2025, you would need, from 2016 on, a primary surplus of about 4,5% of GDP. It is possible, and other countries have kept their primary balances at those levels in the past, but it requires efforts and commitment. In this respect a major achievement is to have put the Fiscal Compact into the Italian constitution. I would also like to stress that the adoption and implementation of structural reforms leading to a path of higher economic growth would make possible a stronger reduction of debt for a given fiscal effort.’’ 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  But austerity has been questioned, also by the IMF: in some countries it even worsened the recession. “The impact of fiscal consolidation greatly depends on how you do your consolidation, on whether you increase taxes or cut expenditures for example, and on what taxes you increase and what expenditures you cut. In Italy you have had so far a greater focus on taxes than on expenditures. One should also try to avoid penalising labour and enterprises. But taxes on labour can only be reduced if spending is curtailed and put under a very tight control. Now Italy needs to be attentive to and cut expenditures: from that point of view, it seems to me that the appointment of Carlo Cottarelli is good news, it gives the right signal”.  Is Italy out of the recession? “Yes, it seems that also Italy is getting out of the recession. I think it is very important, it shows that efforts are paying off in the end, and that there is hope. In Italy the barometer of business confidence is increasing, there is a very important turnaround in confidence indicators. Societies are a little bit like human beings; you have waves of optimism and pessimism, and confidence is very important for firms to return to investment. The turning point is still very fragile, we are only at the beginning of this. That’s why we always say that there are downside risks, especially if structural reforms are stopped. But we see positive momentum building up. Many business firms say: we see the situation improving, reforms are being carried out, but it’s still not sufficient to start really investing. They are still in a waiting mood”.  Italy’s coming out of a crisis that destroyed almost 25% of its industrial production, worse than in many countries of the Eurozone. “In Italy there has been a strong contraction of productive investments, which is restraining growth potential and income creation. Just to give you an idea, investment in the euro area has fallen by 20% since the beginning of the crisis, while in Italy by almost 30% since the beginning of 2008. We believe that investment will start to recover in 2014. In that recovery phase, the ECB will be very attentive, and if there will be credit supply constraints holding back the recovery momentum, we will be ready to act. Contrary to what happens in a recession, where the demand for credit normally shrinks, in a recovery phase credit demand will pick up; and if credit supply will not follow, that could be a problem for the recovery. We will remain attentive that credit supply constrains will not hinder the investment recovery”.  Anti-euro parties are rising. Are you concerned?  “There is a fundamental political question here: do we need more or less Europe? We created an internal market which is working, it was worth creating. But it has become clear that we had too little Europe in crisis management and crisis resolution, to deal in particular with situations where a State is in difficulty. EFSF, ESM and the Banking Union are enormous achievements, in that sense. The new institutional set up is still not complete, but it’s going to be completed over time. The crisis became so acute in Europe because we had too little Europe. And now we are addressing some of the major problems we have had to face”.  Like with the recent agreement on the SRM. We welcome the deal reached by EU finance ministers on the single resolution mechanism, in particular as it allows for swift actions in critical situations. We deem this a fundamental step towards the completion of banking union. But the process is not yet complete and it needs to be finalised soon.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In Italy there is an alarming tendency to question the euro. What scenario, if a country exits the euro? “As the President said at the European Parliament, there is no point in discussing a plan B. Furthermore, now that we have stabilised the euro, this discussion does not reflect the reality that the euro is an irreversible project. But let me say another thing: those dreaming of the world before the euro, tend to forget what it really was, before. You remember the inflation in Italy, the repeated competitive devaluations – which were also a consequence of the loss of competitiveness caused by high inflation – the volatility of the exchange rate, nominal interest rates that were in double-digits, and inflation that was persistently higher than elsewhere and eating up the purchasing power of wages and pensions. In Italy you should think about that. Younger generation maybe don’t know that, and older generations tend to forget that. Suppose now you want to take the risk of changing the currency: can you imagine all the contracts you have, denominated in euro and signed by the parties becoming uncertain? All your debts, your contracts, at private and public level becoming uncertain? Who pays what, in what currency, when? You get you into a nightmare of widespread litigation. And even in a scenario where all people who are parties to a contract denominated in euro are allowed to pay back in new liras, can you imagine how costly that would be for the borrower to discharge his or her debt in a new currency which in the meantime has probably devalued dramatically vis-à-vis the euro? Instead, we need trust and stability, in Europe. And, besides, monetary solutions are never the real solutions. You should trust the lessons of history”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Agus D W Martowardojo: Managing stability, promoting transformation for sustained economic growth Address by Mr Agus D W Martowardojo, Governor of Bank Indonesia, at the Annual Bankers’ Dinner, Jakarta, 14 November 2013. *      *      * Honorable , Leaders and Members of House of Representatives, Supreme Court, People’s Consultative Assembly, Regional Representative Council, and Supreme Audit Board, Ministers of United Indonesia Cabinet II, Chairman of Indonesia Financial Services Authority, Leaders of Non-Government Institutions, International Institutions, and Prominent Bankers, Former Governors of Bank Indonesia, Enterpreneurs, Economists and Scholars, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Assalamu‘alaikum Wr. Wb., Good Evening and May God Bless Us All, 1. I would like to commence our respectable event by praising and thanking God Almighty who has blessed us with the opportunity to gather here in the occasion of Governor’s Address and Annual Bankers’ Dinner 2013. 2. I am delighted to have the opportunity to meet all of you on my initial appearance in our strategic forum this evening. On this momentous occasion, I would like to emphasize that this event is an important platform to harmonize our views on current economic condition, emerging challenges, and efforts to strengthening the measures. 3. Your presence provides additional support for Bank Indonesia in undertaking its mandates, and is essential for us to further enhance economic resilience in dealing with greater challenges ahead. In this regard, allow me to express my humble gratitude for your participation. Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, [Economic Development 2013] 4. Since I took my position in Bank Indonesia, I have personally experienced formidable economic challenges [TABLE 1]. I initially joined Bank Indonesia on May 24th, 2013, just only two days after Chairman of the Federal Reserve indicated its plan to start tapering its monetary stimulus. A very brief signal from the Chairman, yet it has world-wide negative impacts. From that moment until end of August 2013, massive foreign capital flew out from our economy which eventually led to sharp depreciation of the rupiah. 5. However, we observe that global issues overshadowing our economy are much broader than the issue of the Fed’s tapering itself. We view that there are, at least, three main global issues which have created uncertainties and put more pressures on our economy in 2013. 6. First, uncertainty of the speed of global recovery. The global economic recovery process is not as expected, and even slower than previously estimated. The global environment becomes more uncertain because of the shifting of global economic landscape. I still remember, two years ago, we have had a discussion about the two-speed world recovery, i.e. slow recovery in advanced economies, and much faster recovery in emerging 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  economies. Now, the situation has turned around. The United States’ economy has strengthened, the European economy has shown signs of escaping the crisis, while emerging economies have slowed down. In other words, the phenomenon of a three-speed world recovery has emerged [GRAPH 1]. Table 1 Revision of global growth forecast 2013  Graph 1 A three speed world recovery  7. Second, the wide-spread uncertainties as consequences of the US policy’s indecisiveness, not only related to the withdrawal of ultra-accommodative monetary stimulus but also the debt ceiling crisis and the US government shutdown. These prolonged unfavorable circumstances have triggered global investors to re-evaluate risks and caused excessive reactions, which have led to turmoil in the global financial markets, including in Indonesia [GRAPH 2]. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Graph 2. Capital flows & the IDR/USD exchange rate  8. Third, the uncertainty of global commodity prices. In line with the sluggish global economic growth and heightened volatility in the global financial markets, commodity prices have continued its downward trend, confirming the end of commodities super-cycle era [GRAPH 3]. Graph 3 Global commodity prices  Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, 9. The three main global issues I mentioned previously have inevitably affected the performance of Indonesia’s economy. Amidst the robust domestic demand, intense global pressures have put more burden on the current account.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  10. The current account deficits have occurred since the fourth quarter of 2011 [GRAPH 4]. Furthermore, sliding commodity prices which have started since the beginning of 2012 have affected exports that finally led to growing current account deficits. Graph 4 The current account  11. These substantial current account deficits are not only caused by trade balance deficits but also overburdened by prolonged services and income balance deficits [GRAPH 5]. On the other hand, foreign portfolio investment flows have fluctuated associated with changes in sentiment, known as risk-on and risk-off behavior in global financial markets. Together with the issues of current account deficits, turbulence in domestic financial market creates deterioration of the Indonesia balance of payment posture. Graph 5 The net services and income account  12. Economic adjustments are eventually unavoidable. Yet, we argue that these economic adjustments are needed as part of rebalancing process toward a more balanced economy which is aligned with its economic fundamentals. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  13. In line with the deterioration in the balance of payment, rupiah has demonstrated a weakening trend. Moreover, the hike of inflation caused by the reduction in fuel subsidy is also part of the delayed adjustment process. These conditions have finally led to a lower economic growth. Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, [Policy Responses and Current Economic Condition] 14. The Government and Bank Indonesia have taken various policy responses to safeguard economic adjustments. These policies are intended to maintain economic stability to ensure the process of short term adjustments remain in place. In particular, the policy responses are aiming to ensure a stable inflation, maintain exchange rate of rupiah in line with its fundamentals, and reduce current account deficits toward a more robust level. 15. Within these policy directions, Bank Indonesia attempts to further strengthen the policy mix ranging from: (i) Increasing Bank Indonesia Rate by 175 bps to the level of 7,50%, from June to November 2013; (ii) Reinforcing monetary operation; (iii) Stabilizing rupiah exchange rate; (iv) Strengthening macro-prudential policies; (v) Promoting monetary and financial system stability policy cooperation with other central banks; and (vi) Enhancing policy coordination with the Government. 16. On behalf of Bank Indonesia, I would like to extend our sincere appreciation to the Government for its policy responses. The decision to raise the subsidized fuel prices in the end of June 2013 has reduced pressures on fiscal sustainability, although this effort is inadequate to further improve current account posture. In addition, we are of the view that the Government has already taken initial positive steps by introducing the policy packages in August and October 2013. Respected Audience, Table 2 INDONESIA balance of payments – quarterly  17. Without intending to be complacent, it is worthy to mention that the policy responses have demonstrated positive contributions. Various indicators reflect that economic 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  adjustment process remain under control. The trade deficits have started to decline in the third quarter of 2013. The foreign capital inflows has also intensified [TABLE 2]. 18. Positive developments on the balance of payment have supported the stability of rupiah since the end of September 2013. At the same time, the micro structure of foreign exchange market shows improvement as indicated by the increase in the volume of interbank transactions and a more healthy price discovery in the forex market. A lower off-shore non-deliverable forward rate (NDF) compared to the spot rate indicates a more liquid market [GRAPH 6]. Graph 6 Foreign exchange market  19. The high level of inflation following the hike of subsidized fuel prices has returned to its historical pattern [GRAPH 7]. This development suggests that the second round impacts of the hike of subsidized fuel prices were restrained. Although the administered and volatile food prices have significantly increased, core inflation remains below 5,0%. The inflation has surpassed its target of 4,5±1%, yet we forecast inflation in 2013 will slightly fall below 9,0%. Graph 7 Inflation   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  20. We expect our economy will expand by 5,7% in 2013. Although lower than its growth in 2012 that was recorded at 6,2%, the figure is still above the estimated average growth rate of its peer countries of 3,6% [GRAPH 8]. Graph 8 INDONESIA economic growth vis a vis peers  21. The adjustment process of the Indonesia’s economy is also supported by the stability of financial and payment system, as well as sound foreign debt level. Through a consistent policy, excessive pressures stemming from economic adjustments could be avoided [GRAPH 9]. Graph 9 Banking indicators  Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, [Economic Challenges and Opportunities Ahead] 22. Ahead, the current challenges are not about to recede very soon. At the present juncture when the economy is in the adjustment process to a soft landing, I see a number challenges, 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  both global and domestic, remain at the fore. The challenges are not only those that are cyclical in nature but also those that are structural, and therefore demand our collective attention.  23. Along this line, we need to remain vigilant of the global economic growth dynamic. While the global economy in 2014 is projected to expand at around 3.5%, the shift in the world economic landscape is anticipated to continue [TABLE 3]. The average growth of the US and Europe, which only arrived at 2.2% and 1.4% respectively within the last two decades, is expected to rise to 3.1% and 1.6% in the next five years. On the contrary, China’s economy in the subsequent five years will have to accept a new normal growth of around 7%, after expanding at an average 10.25% in the last two decades. Similar pattern is expected to occur in other emerging markets’ economic path. Table 3 The shift in global economic landscape  24. What becomes a concern for us is the risk that the shift in the global landscape will reverse the direction of portfolio flows to advanced countries, particularly the US [GRAPH 10]. Undeniably, the delay in the reduction of US monetary policy stimulus has provided “temporary breathing space” for us at this moment. Nonetheless, the tapering off of the US monetary stimulus is indeed an unquestionable event that will occur in the near future. As a matter of fact, several recent indicators have started to reflect a strengthening of the US economy.  25. Against the background of the above global challenges, equally daunting challenges arise in the domestic front [FIGURE 1]. The first challenge relates to our financial market that needs to be restructured. One of the issues pertains to the fragmentation of rupiah excess liquidity in the banking sector. This calls for attention as it would increase the complexities of monetary operation and disturb the stability of the financial system.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Graph 10 Global capital flows  Figure 1 Structural challenges to monetary policy implementation  26. Another challenge concerning the financial market is its lack of depth and liquidity. In the rupiah market, this is reflected in the low turnover and the anomaly of price formation in the repo market [GRAPH 11]. The collateralized market does not appeal to many market participants and is more expensive compared to the uncollateralized interbank money market. In the meantime, the foreign exchange market is characterized by low volume and inactive hedging transactions. With such micro structure, the exchange rate is easily under pressure even when the demand for foreign exchange experiences a small upsurge.  
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Graph 11 Domestic money market condition  27. The second challenge deals with structural weaknesses that will inhibit our attempt to boost the economy to a higher level. Today, Indonesia has firmed up its position as a middle income country and is in transformation from lower middle income to upper middle income [GRAPH 12]. This implies that the middle class expansion in the last decade will continue and correspondingly our domestic market will enlarge. The structure of demand for goods and services will also be getting more diverse with increasingly complex characteristics [GRAPH 13]. Graph 12 Income per capita   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  Graph 13 Expanding middle class  28. Notwithstanding, amid the changing structure of aggregate demand, I view that the economy has expanded too rapidly and is susceptible to correction [FIGURE 2]. The Economic expansion is also followed by a weakening posture of the current account. Consequently, the pace of economic growth to a higher path is hindered. Figure 2 Structural challenges   
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  29. I view the above impediment to economic growth as a reflection of the existing imbalance between the structure of aggregate demand and the capability of the supply side. In the supply side, the production structure that took shape within the last decade has been gradually felt to be obsolete. 30. This is actually a sensible development [GRAPH 14]. The existing production structure reflects the comparative advantage that we used to utilize to take Indonesia transforming from low to middle income country. The abundant natural resources heritage outside Java and the human resources surplus in Java have become the primary assets that lifted a large part of our society out of the poverty trap. These primary resources have enabled us to build an industrial order dominated by export industries that are intensive in human and natural resources such as coal mining and crude palm oil industry. Graph 14 Net exports of natural resources and low tech industry  31. Nevertheless, when Indonesia finally stepped up to become a middle income country with a growing middle class, such industrial order is no longer sufficient. The typical characteristic of a middle class society is having the desire and simultaneously the capability to purchase goods with higher quality and value added. In line with the increased complexities of the demanded goods, greater basis for comparative advantage and industrial capability are undoubtedly needed. 32. This gap between demand and supply is increasingly fulfilled by imports, primarily goods produced by middle and high technology industry [GRAPH 15]. The net imports of goods in this category have grown larger since Indonesia stepped into a middle income country category in 2014. This technology deficit in the supply side is felt across the nation. Nonetheless, the stronger industrial capacity in Java has not sufficed in accommodating the substantial changes in the structure of national demand. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 13  Graph 15 Spatial profile of trade balance in Nusantara  33. I believe this condition does not stay apart from the impact of several aspects that are inadequate and need to be improved. First, the availability of infrastructure for connectivity both digitally and physically. Second, the management of domestic energy. The energy management aspect has acquired growing attention as the augmenting demand for energy has to be fulfilled by imports, which eventually aggravates the ongoing problem of current account deficit. Third, several aspects related to business climate that are under the close watch of businesses, including ease of starting up a business, legal certainty, registration of personal proprietary right, insolvency settlement, and enforcing contract.  34. Overall, the above domestic structural challenges demand our increased attention as our integration with the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) is looming near in 2015. The question for us is “Are we able to gain the benefit of AEC and develop to be part of the global value chain, or merely become a target market?” Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, [General Policy Direction] Figure 3 Policy direction   
14 BIS central bankers’ speeches  35. In the spirit of determination and thrust to respond to the challenges and strengthen the stepping stone toward sustainable growth, allow me to convey Bank Indonesia’s policy direction ahead and a number thoughts concerning the structural reformation that we need to pursue together with the Government [FIGURE 3]. 36. Let me underline that in our policy direction ahead, including in the period of political transition in 2014, Bank Indonesia will consistently preserve the stability of the economy and the financial system. Stability needs to be prioritized in order to create a more balanced and sound economic structure, therefore becoming a strong foundation for economic transformation in the future. 37. The economic balance that I am referring here is economic growth that is supported by a sustainable posture of the current account. On the one hand, sustainable can be interpreted as a condition where exports have high value added and industries are capable of producing intermediate goods and services that so far still rely on imports. On the other hand, the financing of current account should derive from more permanent sources, i.e. Foreign Direct Investments that will propel the growth and development of advanced and globally competitive industry sector. 38. With the complexities of the confronted challenges, BI’s policy direction is measured in terms both goal and time dimensions. As regard the goal dimension, BI is not simply committed to manage inflation to be between its target range, but more broadly, is also directed to manage current account toward a sustainable path, while preserving the stability of the financial system. 39. The effort to attain low inflation is not negotiable as it becomes a pre-condition for the sustainability of the economy. Notwithstanding, the Asian and global crisis demonstrate that low inflation is not sufficient to warrant sustainable economic growth. 40. The journey of our economy post 97/98 Asian shows that we need to remain vigilant even when inflation rate remains low, because it may well be a delayed inflation which will be accompanied by increasing current account deficit. The inflation phenomenon was indeed delayed since the risk of rising inflation was temporarily absorbed by government subsidies such as fuel and energy subsidies. Inflation rate was also subdued owing to decreased pressure from imports as the prices of global commodities declined. 41. From the time dimension, Bank Indonesia’s policy stance will consistently be adopted in a time-consistent manner until the economic condition becomes more balanced. This dimension is in line with the structural challenges which will take quite a long time to be resolved. 42. In sum, Bank Indonesia’s policy direction is implemented through a policy mix in the monetary, macropudential and payment system area. Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, [Monetary Policy Direction] 43. In the area of monetary policy, the BI Rate will be consistently directed towards controlling inflation to be within its target. Furthermore, the monetary policy stance is taken to support efforts in reducing the current account deficit to achieve a sustainable level and to maintain a robust financial system stability. 44. The exchange rate policy is aimed at guiding the exchange rate to move within its fundamental value acting as shock absorber instrument of the economy and not as shock amplifier. In this context, a deep and liquid foreign exchange market is needed to support a more efficient creation of the exchange rate. 45. The monetary policy is strengthened with a number of monetary operation strategies. In the area of rupiah liquidity management, the monetary operation strategy will be to continue to absorb structural excess liquidity in a guided and measured manner. This is conducted 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 15  among others by extending the open market operation tenor through the introduction of the 1 year or longer SBI tenor and the Medium Term Notes. 46. Furthermore, Bank Indonesia will continue to strengthen the development of the rupiah and the forex money market and the deepening of the financial market. As an initial step, the facilitation of the “mini” Master Repo Agreement initiative for a number of pilotbanks is seen as a meaningful step and will contribute to the implementation of a larger scale initiative which is the General Master Repo Agreement. In addition, Bank Indonesia will also issue a number of money market regulation and several funding instruments for financial institution liquidity management such as the revision of the commercial paper regulation and the inter bank repo transaction based on syariah principle. We will also undergo policy harmonization and increase dissemination and education to the market player. 47. One policy which we will continue to take to improve external endurance is the strengthening of the second line of defence through financial cooperation with other central banks and financial authorities in the region. We view these types of cooperation should be continuously strengthened to anticipate against uncertainty of risk of the global economic condition that can instantly weakened the external sector performance. Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, [Macroprudential Policy Direction] 48. In an effort to strengthen external sector endurance, we will also adopt macroprudential policy through supervisory action. The macroprudential policy is aimed at strengthening credit composition extended to productive sectors with export orientation and which provide import substitute goods and support efforts to increase economic capacity. 49. Bank Indonesia will also buttress the implementation of its new function and authority as the macroprudential authority. In this context, macroprudential policy will be directed towards systemic risk management, including credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, as well as strengthening the capital structure [FIGURE 4]. Figure 4 Macroprudential policy mix   
16 BIS central bankers’ speeches  50. In managing liquidity risk, we will improve the syariah minimum reserve requirement and introduce a staged Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) instrument starting from January 1, 2015. As the time for its implementation is nearing, I urge banks to include the LCR target in their respective 2014 Bank Business Plan. In the area of capital buffer, the calculation of bank capital will be enhanced by the incorporation of more complex and comprehensive risk elements, such as the economic cycle and assessment of banks with systemic impact. 51. In the area of strengthening financial system stability, I view the enhancing of a macro-micro coordination between Bank Indonesia and OJK to be important. I have initiated the macro-micro coordination effort by the signing of the Joint Decree (SKB) on October 18, 2013. In principle, the Joint Decree includes commitment to ensure the smooth transition of the bank microprudential supervision and the effective implementation of the task, function, and authority of each institution. 52. Enhancement of macro and microprudential coordination is important to prevent any increase in regulatory cost, discourage regulatory arbitrage, and improve the quality of the Crisis Management Protocol (CMP). In the area of financial sector policy, I am confident that OJK will preserve consistency of the banking regulation and supervision and continue the policies/commitments agreed thus far with the banking industry. 53. Nevertheless, I view coordination between the two authorities can be further strengthened with coordination and cooperation between institutions in the context of crisis prevention and resolution. Such coordination is necessary to provide legal certainty basis in terms of crisis prevention and resolution. On that note, I am hopeful that the financial system safety net law can be introduced soon to serve as an umbrella for a better cooperation between relevant authorities. 54. Strengthening the financial system, specifically the banking sector, becomes more critical in response to the implementation of the AEC in the financial services sector in the year 2020. It is in my view that improving perseverance and competitiveness as key factors to a healthy competition. Banks must escalate their business scale in order to achieve a higher level of economic of scale and concurrently an improved governance. 55. It is in this context that I wish to remind banks undergoing corporate actions or holding an unfavorable governance rating and bank soundness level by the end of 2013, to adjust their ownership composition to be in line with the threshold established. Such adjustment should also follow the existing regulation in place and the transfer of ownership share to other parties must gain clearance from the authority. I wish to avoid the buying and selling of business permit since in principle business permit granted are merely facilities provided by the state and cannot be transferred without prior approval from the rightful authority. 56. The same principle also applies to the transfer of bank ownership share to foreign investors. In principle, these investors can play a role in the national banking industry. However, it must be carried out in a proportional and reciprocal manner and delivering benefits to the economy. In this context, authorities agreement and commitment between countries is necessary to ensure equality in terms of market access as well as national treatment and an adequate cross-border supervision. 57. The development of syariah financing is also a priority in strengthening financial system stability. The relatively rapid development of legal and institutional infrastructure, as well as syariah financial market and its supporting instruments since 2008 will continue to be broaden to boost syariah principle based economic contribution to the national economic growth. Within this framework, existing syariah education program will be enhanced to become an economic movement, the so called Syariah Economic Movement which is expected to commence in the near future. Distinguished Guest, Ladies and Gentlemen, [Payment System Policy Direction] 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 17  58. In the area of payment system policy, Bank Indonesia will remain to be the rightful authority to regulate, develop, monitor and grant payment system operation license. In this capacity, we will develop a more efficient domestic payment system industry through the improvement of payment system architecture and broadening access to payment services. Such policy is taken to anticipate rising public needs for non cash instrument payment. We will also reinforce regulatory and payment system monitoring aspect through the improvement of capacity, including improvement of the Bank Indonesia human resource competency in the area of fund transfer operation and foreign exchange merchant [FIGURE 5]. Figure 5 Payment system policy  59. In its implementation, the payment system policy will be based on three main strategies as follows: (1) strengthening the domestic industrial structure, (2) technical and mechanism standardization to improve efficiency, and (3) expansion of access to payment services. The first strategy is implemented through the development of the National Payment Gateway [FIGURE 6]. This initiative can increase domestic industry efficiency in terms of cost reduction – cost of transaction, mitigate systemic risk on settlement activities and broaden payment access. Figure 6 National payment gateway timeframe   
18 BIS central bankers’ speeches  60. The second strategy will be carried out by developing standardization aspect in the national payment system industry. Such strategy will create a safe and smooth functioning of the system, preserve a healthy competition and will not create any economic rent. Furthermore, we will also promote the standardization of Government routine expenditure through non cash mechanism. 61. The third strategy will be conducted as an integral part of the financial inclusion policy supported by education program and consumer protection. This is done by making use of innovation and information technology, specifically through the simplification of know your customer, while maintaining its reliability in the implementation of the know your customer principles. To further promote non cash payment system we will explore cooperation with the Government for the possibility of providing fiscal incentive for non cash transactions. Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, [Financial Inclusion and SMEs Policy Direction] 62. In addition to the monetary, macroprudential, and payment system policy, Bank Indonesia will also strengthen its policy in relation to financial inclusion and SMEs [FIGURE 7]. The two policies have roles in promoting banking intermediation and efficiency hence contributing to the strengthening of the financial system stability and supporting policy in the payment system area. Figure 7 The scope of financial inclusion & SMEs policy  63. The financial inclusion policy is focused on five main strategies. First, enhancing financial education as an effort to alter financial management behaviour, especially to the low income part of society. Second, improving financial access supported by the firming up of the payment system infrastructure, utilizing information technology and innovation, as well as local economic unit network. Third, consumer protection to ensure the public’s rights when using financial access and the payment system. Fourth, reduction of asymmetric information by providing financial profile data of the public currently untouched by the banking sector and commodity information data. Fifth, introduction of regulation under the financial system stability framework as well as providing policy recommendation to relevant authorities 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 19  [FIGURE 8]. Meanwhile, the policy on SMEs in principle adopts a similar strategy to the financial inclusion and further complemented with the improvement of SMEs capacity. Figure 8 The principles of financial inclusion & SMEs policy  Distinguished guests, <Coordination with Government> 64. Efforts in responding to economic challenges necessitate coordination with the Government, especially on issues related to structural challenges. Within the scope of cyclical challenges, Bank Indonesia once again appreciates the steps taken by Government in controlling the 2014 Budget deficit at 1,7% of GDP. That target reflects our similar perspective in prioritizing efforts for economic stabilization. Nevertheless, persistent strength in demand for subsidized fuel remains as our common challenge. Figure 9 A global race to prosperity   
20 BIS central bankers’ speeches  65. In addressing the dimension of structural challenges, it is noteworthy for us to improve the quality and speed in implementing public policy in order not to lag behind competitors in the global strategic environment [FIGURE 9]. In this regard, a need for acceleration in various policies to improve the quantity and quality of infrastructure, strengthening the management of domestic energy, including speeding up the development of a clean and renewable alternative energy, and ameliorating every aspect related to ease of doing business in Indonesia such as law and regulation. I believe that the strengthening of every elementary aspect in our competitiveness will lessen our technology deficit and improve our industry capabilities. 66. Within the same context, Indonesia needs to strengthen its investment strategy in promoting the development of upstream industry for intermediate goods with high value-added. Therefore, the presence of manufacturing FDI by global manufacturers of quality and who are market leaders within their respective industries must become the complementary part of our national investment policy in the future. In the same sense, Indonesia will also benefit by the downstreaming of natural resources extractive activity. Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, 67. I am aware completely that everything that I have conveyed regarding improvement of production structure on the supply side could not be materialized in the near term. Nonetheless, I hold the view that not much time is available to keep postponing steps in materializing them. 68. Indonesia’s position as a middle income country which is progressing to become a high income country requires us to rethink the relevance of economic growth model that we have always been implementing. Indonesia as a middle income country could no longer rely only on cheap labor wages and extractive activities. It is about time for us to switch towards a growth model that emphasizes increased industrial capabilities. 69. Also within that context, the whole efforts in overcoming the structural deficit in the supply side need to be mounted as a joint effort in building an innovation ecosystem across Indonesia, as a “New Growth Model”. In that ecosystem, diffusion of technology, R&D and innovation activities, intellectual property rights, risk capital and education activities, interact with each other without barrier and supported by the availability of reliable connectivity both physical and digital. 70. Encompassing all of those, we can expect that the national economy will transform to become more reliable, efficient, and globally competitive, with sustainable economic growth in a stable economic environment. Respected audience, [Economic Prospect 2014] 71. Considering those economic challenges and the policy direction which will be taken by Bank Indonesia and Government, it can be expected that our economy in 2014 will be in a consolidation phase [FIGURE 10]. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 21  Figure 10 Cyclical economic forecast  72. This consolidation is tied to the still unfinished economic correction process in rectifying our current account deficit, which is expected to decrease in 2014. Imports which are increasingly manageable, along with the recovery process within the domestic economy are expected to support the improvement of the current account balance. 73. Economic growth in 2014 is expected to improve within the range of 5,8–6,2%. This prospect is supported by improvement in export along the improvement of global economy and domestic demands. However, projection of current account balance and potential downside risk in economic growth will require attention considering that the process of slowing global economy is still ongoing. The prospect could change direction if the process of global economic recovery is stopped, as happened in 2013. 74. From the perspective of price, we project that inflation in 2014 will be back under control, within the target range of 4,5±1%. This is influenced by the positive impacts from various policies taken by the Government and Bank Indonesia. Inflation of foods and inflation of administered prices are expected to be stabilized, supported by expectation of improvement in the supply and distribution of food, assuming there will be no more policy of price increases that is of strategic nature. Core inflation is expected to remain controlled due to the preservation of supply availability, stable Rupiah exchange rate, and manageable inflation expectation. 75. For the prospect of banking in 2014, potentially fragile economy and interest rates increases need to be anticipated. In this sense, we forecast that credit growth from banking in 2014 will be within the range of 15–17%, supported by growth in Deposits along the same pace. In our assessment, that pace of credit growth is consistent with our efforts in balancing the economy. Therefore, I expect the active involvement of the banking sector to adjust the target of credit growth in each respective Bank Business Plan for 2014 to be more consistent with our effort in managing the economy towards a healthier direction. Respected ladies and gentlemen, <Medium-term prospects> 76. In the medium-term perspectives of 2015–2018, global economy is expected to grow at an average rate of 3,9%, driven by expected improvement of economic activities within the United States. Prices of non-oil and gas commodities are expected to increase, albeit limited. Nevertheless, prospect of global oil price needs to be carefully monitored because it can potentially increase due to ongoing global economic recovery. 
22 BIS central bankers’ speeches  77. Indonesian economic growth is expected to reach 6,5% in 2018, if all transformation policies in the economy proceed according to expectation [FIGURE 11]. I take the view that those policies can improve the structural balance between demand and supply, while also easing the problem of current account balance structure. Along the same line, economic growth could be stuck at 6% if the transformation process does not proceed according to expectation. Figure 11 Medium-term economic prospect  Distinguished ladies and gentlemen <Vision, Mission and Strategic Values of BI > 78. In order to achieve those important targets, Bank Indonesia is transforming itself. We have launched our vision until 2024, which is to become a central bank that is to be a credible institution and the best central bank in the region. 79. We strive to be the best in the implementation of policy mix, macroprudential development, management of capital flow, initiative policies for the creation of Regional Financial Safety Net, financial inclusion and SMEs, and the development of digital financial services. All those will proceed along the stage of restructuring, enhancing, and shaping the end state, for the achievement of low inflation and stable exchange rate. 80. To support the achievement of our vision, we want to ensure that all potential resources within our control are functioning more effectively. Therefore, our new strategic values, which comprise (1) upholding trust and integrity, (2) promoting professionalism, (3) seeking perfect performance, (4) prioritizing public interest, and (5) strengthening coordination and teamwork, will be continually strengthened to support the achievement of that vision. Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, <Closing/Epilogue> 81. Looking at the issues and challenges that we currently face, it is not difficult for us to imagine the bigger problem that is waiting for us in the future if we fail to act quickly and appropriately. We have not achieved an optimal economic growth, while being faced with the challenge of restoring our current account balance, and simultaneously we must also continuously improve to advance the economic transformation towards the direction that we aspire to. 82. In that regard, we have to commonly develop a work ethic and we will not rest until those goals are achieved. Before concluding tonight remarks, please kindly allow me to quote a known philosopher from the 4th century BC, Cicero: “within the character of the citizen, lies 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 23  the welfare of the nation.” That the development of a nation cannot be separated from the work ethic and character of the nation itself. 83. Allow me to conclude my remarks tonight. May God Almighty bless and lighten our steps forward. That will be all and thank you. Wassalamu’alaikum Wr. Wb.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Turalay Kenç: Fostering longstanding relations – opening of the Bundesbank Representative Office in Istanbul Speech by Mr Turalay Kenç, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the Opening Ceremony of the Bundesbank’s Representative Office, Istanbul, 26 November 2013. *      *      * Excellency Wolke, Esteemed Dr. Dombret, Distinguished Participants, Ladies and Gentlemen, At the outset, allow me to express the pleasure and appreciation of the Central Bank of Turkey on the occasion of the opening ceremony of the Bundesbank’s Representative Office in our beautiful city of İstanbul. It is a distinct honour for me to have the opportunity to deliver a couple of remarks before distinguished participants in this historical opening event, as this is the first representative office in Turkey of a fellow central bank. First of all, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is very pleased with the signing of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) this year with your esteemed central bank. This is so, not only because the majority of the Bundesbank policies have been regarded as gold standards in central banking, but also because the Bundesbank is the central bank of Germany that is our main trading partner and highest ranking foreign capital provider. The MoU agreement manifests the commitment of both institutions to foster long standing relations. In the spirit of the MoU agreement, a primary step in our cooperation is to establish high level policy dialogue with the Bundesbank on a regular basis, the first of which will be held in 2014. This is timely, considering that not only will Turkey assume the G20 presidency in 2015 and engage in an even closer interaction with the central banks of the G20 member states, but will also help meet the recently increased need for policy dialogues over the implementation and implications of new unconventional monetary policies. In general, the CBRT places great emphasis on bilateral relations with fellow central banks, especially those of the G20 member countries. The year 2012 is a testament to our commitment, as the CBRT opened six new representative offices, which brought the total number to ten. The first-round representative offices include those in Frankfurt, NY City, London and Tokyo. The ones opened later on are in Moscow and Sydney – to strengthen relations with other G20 presidency countries; Beijing and Kuala Lumpur – to strengthen relations with the Asian countries; Paris – to strengthen relations with the OECD, and finally Washington, DC – to strengthen relations with the IMF. In her efforts to enhance regional cooperation, the CBRT laid the foundations of the dialogue among central banks that paved the way for the establishment of the Central Banks Governors’ Club of Central Asia, the Black Sea Region and the Balkan Countries.  The relations and cooperation of the CBRT in the international scene go well beyond our bilateral dialogue with your esteemed Bank and cover also the financial level (swap agreements signed with certain countries), as well as the educational level (the establishment of an international central banking research facility and regional training centre, the İstanbul School of Central Banking). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  I would like to thank the Bundesbank for opening a Representative Office in İstanbul, for signing the MoU agreement and for all the support and assistance you have provided us in diverse fields and at various platforms. Closing my remarks, I would like to welcome my friend and colleague, Dr. Andreas Dombret, a member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, and thank him for his tremendous efforts in bringing this project to life. Now let us celebrate our achievements. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Rodrigo Vergara: The Monetary Policy Report and the Financial Stability Report Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, before the Finance Commission of the Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 3 December 2013. *      *      * The Monetary Policy Report of December 2013 and the Financial Stability Report of the second half of 2013 can be found at http://www.bcentral.cl. Introduction Mr. President of the Senate’s Finance Commission, Senator Andrés Zaldívar, senators members of this Commission, ladies and gentlemen. I am grateful for your invitation to present the vision of the Central Bank’s Board on the recent macroeconomic and financial developments, its Outlook and implications on monetary and financial policy. This vision is contained in detail in our December Monetary Policy Report and our second-half Financial Stability Report we are presenting now. The macroeconomic scenario has evolved along the trends described in the latest Monetary Policy Reports. In the external scenario, growth is more balanced between developed and emerging economies than it was before the subprime crisis hit. International financial conditions are steadily normalizing, while the terms of trade are declining and approaching their trend values.  In this scenario, the Chilean economy will receive a milder boost from abroad than we saw in recent years. The less expansionary monetary policies in the developed world will be coupled with a rebound in developed economies that will favor not only these countries but the world economy at large. Certainly, some countries have more reasons to worry than others about these adjustments in the world economy, because of their external and domestic vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the past and present volatility of the world will continue to affect our economy, but, while we are certainly not immune to what happens outside our borders, we feel we are on a good stand to deal with this transition. At home, output and demand are gradually decelerating and inflation is still low. Our projections, which I will be reviewing shortly, indicate that in the short term the Chilean economy will continue to expand somewhat below trend, affected by the normalization of the mining investment cycle and labor market conditions. We thus estimate a 4.2 percent growth for this year and a 3.75 to 4.75 percent range for next. This 2014 forecast range is slightly less than what we were expecting in September. Although these growth rates represent a slowdown from previous years, we see no obstacles ahead that could prevent our economy from resuming growth at closer to trend rates, which we continue to estimate at 5 percent annually. In this context, the Board decided to lower the monetary policy rate from 5 to 4.5 percent in its meetings of October and November, in order to accommodate the monetary stimulus to our slower economy and not jeopardize the convergence of inflation to the target. The recent reduction of the MPR is part of a necessary adjustment to deal with recent changes in our macroeconomy and, as I said, ensure compliance with our inflation objective. Going forward, further changes to the MPR will depend on incoming information and its implications on the economy’s evolution. Actually, the baseline scenario does not foresee the need for any significant changes in the MPR but, should such need arise, monetary policy has room and is prepared for further adjustments. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Over the period, both the real and the nominal exchange rates have depreciated, which is part of the process of restructuring the sources of growth after some time when domestic demand has been the primary driver of such growth. Let me now describe for you our baseline scenario and the main risks we have identified in our reports. Macroeconomic scenario Chile’s third-quarter growth was 4.7 percent y-o-y. Mining grew strongly, boosted by the startup of major investment projects of recent years. Thus, mining exports have increased, helping to reduce the current account deficit. Sectors other than natural resources, meanwhile, continued to post lower growth rates than in 2012 (figure 1). This, together with the revision to growth rates of earlier quarters, confirmed that the Chilean economy has lost some strength compared with last year. On the expenditure side, the slowdown extended to each and every component, including private consumption, which was accompanied with significant inventory depletion (figure 2). In this trajectory, the maturation of the mining investment cycle discussed in previous Reports has played a major role. In addition, the extraordinary imports of transport materials of the last quarter of 2012 did not continue into this year, and imports of other capital goods were weak in the past few months. Consumption has also slowed down, although its adjustment has proceeded gradually, because of still tight labor market conditions, real wages growing strongly and consumer expectations still optimistic, although less so than in the first half of the year. The deceleration of private consumption is expected to continue over the coming months coupled with a not so strong labor market, a vision that is grounded on our business perception report Informe de Percepciones de Negocios. CPI inflation has been below expectations, mainly reflecting the drop in international fuel prices, which more than offset the seasonal price increases of some perishable foods and the peso depreciation. Thus, in October the CPI rose 1.5% y-o-y, which again placed it temporarily below the tolerance range. In contrast, the core measure CPIEFE brought no major surprises and continued to increase up to 1.6% annually in the same month. Two years ahead inflation expectations remain around 3% (figure 3). In the international financial markets, movements in the last few months have been largely determined by news about the future course of monetary and fiscal policies in the United States. Recall that, after the signs delivered by the Federal Reserve last May, the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus was expected to begin in September. This drove up long-term interest rates by more than 100 basis points in the U.S., the currencies depreciated against the dollar and volatility increased, with particularly harsh effects on emerging economies. Later on, as such withdrawal did not occur in September, interest rates receded some and calm returned to the markets. Although this resulted in some improvement of the external lending standards to emerging economies, our baseline scenario considers the possibility of recurrent episodes of volatility during the transition towards more normal financial conditions. For one thing, the temporary nature of the U.S. fiscal agreements could bring new tensions in early 2014, although this seems less likely.  At any rate, external lending conditions are less favorable than they were early in the year. Compared with September, long-term interest rates dropped as the Federal Reserve kept the asset purchase plan unchanged, and at the same time international stock markets improved. Several emerging market currencies depreciated against the dollar – the Chilean peso included – which was trading at more than $520 per dollar in November and has recently surpassed $530. The real exchange rate, as I said, has risen to near its 15 to 20 years’ average. In terms of the outlook for global growth, developed economies are still in a process of gradual recovery. In the third quarter, the U.S. exceeded market consensus expectations 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and, although inventory accumulation played a part, the improved performance of the housing and labor markets, combined with better entrepreneurial and consumer expectations, the behavior of stock and other asset prices and, in particular, the lower intensity of the fiscal adjustment suggest that next year the country will outperform its 2013 figures. The recovery of the Japanese economy is still ongoing, but the tax increases announced for 2014 will taper economic growth. The Eurozone posted positive growth for the second consecutive quarter, although less than expected by the consensus. Worth noting were the slower growth of Germany and the contraction of the French economy and, on a positive note, that some of the peripheral economies grew again. Emerging economies have slowed down further and consensus forecasts have seen new downward revisions. In China, after a substantial correction to its growth projections in the first half of the year, recent data show growth stabilizing around 7.5 percent, quite less than in recent years, however. The baseline scenario assumes that the Chinese economy will slow further to reach 7.2 percent annually in 2015, which points to the need to continue to restructure its sources of growth and resolve some of the vulnerabilities of its financial system.  In the rest of the emerging world, economic activity continues to moderate, leading some economies to lower their benchmark rates. Others, however, have restricted their monetary policies responding to higher inflationary and exchange rate pressures related to fiscal, monetary or external vulnerabilities. Anyway, the slower growth expected in China, lower commodity prices, less expansionary international financial conditions, the contractionary adjustments in some large emerging economies and the need to progress in the strengthening of the Chinese financial system plus its growth re-composition are behind the vision that emerging economies will expand at a slower pace than during the last three years. The baseline scenario of our Monetary Policy Report foresees that, after expanding at 3.4 percent in 2013, our trading partners will grow by 3.6 and 3.8 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, somewhat less than we thought in September. In this context, inflation has been below expectations in both emerging and developed economies. Commodity prices have dropped. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have eased with respect to a few months ago, as have some refinery problems in the United States, which led to lower actual and expected fuel prices compared with September. The copper price, after remaining fairly stable for some months, posted a decline in recent weeks, so the price outlook for the metal remains unchanged from the previous Report. Accordingly, the baseline scenario assumes that the terms of trade will not divert from those in the last Report (table 1). As I have already mentioned, our baseline scenario estimates that the Chilean economy will expand 4.2 percent in 2013, and between 3.75 and 4.75 percent in 2014, slightly less than forecast in September. In 2014, gross fixed capital formation will grow near the rate of this year. As for consumption, the baseline scenario foresees a slight deceleration from 2013. This forecast combines, on one hand, a moderation in private income growth, inflation converging to 3 percent and an exchange rate depreciation that will affect durable consumption. On the other, still optimistic consumer expectations and a strong labor market – although not as tight as this year – that will continue to underpin consumption. This scenario assumes an external impulse similar to September’s. Furthermore, it considers that part of the inventory depletion of recent quarters is an unwanted development, so it will be reversed in the coming months. Taking into account the weaker imports and stronger exports, this scenario also foresees a narrowing of the current account deficit compared with the September estimate: 3.2 percent of GDP this year and 3.7 percent in 2014. The surprise here – a positive one indeed – is that some of the trends that were anticipated in previous reports, have come sooner and stronger. In particular, the maturation of the mining investment cycle, which has been one of the main sources of the higher deficit due to its import component, has allowed copper exports to grow beyond expectations, while capital imports have begun to decline. The estimate of the current account deficit measured at trend 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  prices is also adjusted downward, so the risk associated with the evolution of the current account that had been identified in the last Monetary Policy Report is reduced (table 2). In the baseline scenario, CPI inflation will converge to 3 percent towards the end of the projection horizon, this time the last quarter of 2015. Thus, reaching the target will take longer than expected in September. The CPIEFE will continue to gradually approach 3 percent, without major changes from the September forecast (figure 4). This projection implies that nominal wages will be adjusted in line with productivity and the inflation target. It also includes as a methodological assumption that the RER will remain virtually unchanged. Finally, the baseline scenario uses as a working methodological assumption that the policy rate will follow a path similar to the one shown in the latest Economic Expectations Survey (figure 5). The baseline scenario reflects those events that are estimated to be the most likely to occur with the information at hand at the closing of this Report. There are risk scenarios, however, which if materialized, may reshape the macroeconomic environment and, therefore, may modify the course of monetary policy. On this opportunity, having evaluated the alternative scenarios, the Board estimates that the risk balance is unbiased for both output and inflation. On the external front, one risk relates to growth in emerging economies, particularly China. Concerns persist about the fragility of the Chinese financial system, which together with doubts about the evolution of real-estate prices could limit its future growth prospects. As has been noted before, China’s evolution is cause for unrest because of its weight in world GDP and its impact on the pricing of commodities, copper included. The volatility that financial markets have shown in recent months implies that ending the quantitative easing in the U.S. will not be stress-free, especially because of the difficulty to calibrate the policy actions of this unprecedented process. In this regard, a major risk has to do with its effects on some of the larger emerging economies that have accumulated macroeconomic imbalances and are more dependent on external financing. The risk associated with the complex interaction between weak growth, a frail fiscal situation and financial problems in Europe is still present. At home, headline inflation of recent quarters has been lower than forecast, and the moment when it will expectedly reach the target has been postponed time and again. While the recent cuts to the MPR will help inflation converge to 3 percent, if the widespread slowdown in all the demand components is confirmed, along with longer-lasting low inflation in the rest of the world and maybe a sharper fall in international fuel prices could further postpone such convergence to 3 percent. However, the depreciation of the peso and the still tight labor market could work in the opposite direction. Projections indicate that in the short term the Chilean economy will continue to expand somewhat below trend for still some quarters. However, labor market conditions and a faster recovery in inventories, among other factors, could result in a faster recovery of the economy that would bring it closer to its trend. In the Financial Stability Report we are presenting today, the same risk scenarios coming from abroad that I have just identified are examined, this time from the perspective of their impact on our domestic economy’s financial stability. We conclude that of the three risk scenarios described, the episode of volatility originating in the monetary stimulus withdrawal is the most likely to occur. However, a deepening of the Eurozone crisis or a sharp deceleration of a systemic emerging economy would have stronger effects on the Chilean financial system. Especially because, as I have noted, the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus in the United States will come about when the U.S. economy’s improved growth is already confirmed. The banking industry’s capital levels are adequate to remain solvent before a significant deterioration of economic growth and financial conditions. Stress tests show that the banks’ current capital levels allow them to absorb potential losses generated by a macroeconomic 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  risk scenario that combines a GDP contraction – like that of the subprime crisis – higher financial costs for the short and long term, and a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate. One such test – motivated by the risk scenarios identified in the process of monetary tapering in the U.S. – shows little exposure of the banking system to a sharp increase in the interest rates of long-term securities. Meanwhile, households’ aggregate borrowing and financial burden indicators show a marginal decline, although with some changes in the composition of the debt. The share of bank debt has increased compared with other credit providers, while total corporate debt is stable as a ratio to GDP and the financial indicators of companies reporting to the Superintendence of Securities and Insurance (SVS) are also fairly stable. Capital inflows to Chile continue to be dominated by FDI while aggregate solvency and liquidity figures are also stable. In this way, our general analysis of the domestic financial system yields that it is on a good standing to deal with the risk scenarios described, and we see no incubation of systemic risks at the local level. This explains, in part, why the recent volatility episode in foreign financial markets had lesser effects on the Chilean financial system than in other emerging economies, where risks did incubate over the past few years. However, to maintain this resilience the different players making up the financial system must take the necessary decisions and safeguards, especially considering the dynamism of the financial sector. One first firewall, perhaps the most important one, is the one related to corporate stockholders, who should establish and implement clear policies aimed at restricting their operating risks via corporate governance, boards and management. A second firewall is related to public institutions such as the Superintendences and the Central Bank, which have complementary roles in the monitoring, supervision and regulation of the financial system. The continual improvement of regulations and laws, as well as the search for best practices at the global level is one objective that must always be present in our actions. Within this monitoring role, our Financial Stability Report plays a key role. In it we identify developments which, if intensified, might create risks, or where we believe there is room to reduce residual risks.  I would like now to describe some of these developments as well as the main regulatory amendments that have been implemented during the last six months. In our Financial Stability Reports a couple of issues ago we warned about some developments in the real estate sector which, if intensified, could become a source of risk. We were particularly concerned about the combination of dynamic prices with a credit acceleration originating in this sector. In this context, one good element is that mortgage credit growth has remained stable, with no relaxation of lending standards for mortgage loans or credit to construction and real estate firms. However, housing price indexes are as dynamic as in previous periods, in a scenario of high demand and low inventories. Meanwhile, the expected supply of office space continues to rise and is in historically high levels. In this context, it is important that all players involved consider in their investment and funding decisions that the current price and demand trends of the sector might not continue, especially considering the external risks described, the expected increase in supply and the economic slowdown. While total household debt over income has dropped, the available evidence suggests that bank debt remains dynamic, particularly in the middle to upper income homes. To the extent that banks properly evaluate and analyze the credit risks inherent in this segment, it should not be a source of vulnerability. However, there are factors that could contribute to an underestimation of these risks. First, rolling credits have been pretty dynamic in recent years. Second, the absence of a consolidated debtor data base hinders any household credit risk assessment for supervisors and suppliers – a concern we brought up before this Senate last time we presented our Financial Stability Report. Finally, those banks that have recently expanded a lot their consumer loan portfolios have seen a sharper deterioration of their 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  NPLs indicators, consistent with greater risk taking in this segment. So far, this has been accompanied by increased provisions. While in recent years the overall Chilean banking system has tended to reduce its dependence on short-term wholesale funding, some small and midsize banks remain highly dependent on this source. Although wholesale funding plays an important role in market discipline, it is particularly sensitive to changes in perceptions about the risk of issuers and to the assets’ liquidity in the secondary market. In addition, the events of recent years show that negative developments in foreign or local financial conglomerates may adversely affect the cost of funds in the wholesale market for the banks belonging to these groups.  Accordingly, it is important that banks maintain a diversified funding base in terms of counterparties and maturities. Also, banks should use in their liquidity management stress tests and contingency plans that appropriately reflect their risks, business strategies, financial condition and financing ability under different scenarios. In addition, it is important that banks properly internalize the economic and reputational risks of their exposure to related entities, for which a proper corporate governance framework is crucial. In this context, I would like to bring to your attention four regulatory elements. First, the Superintendence of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBIF) perfected its regulatory framework on corporate governance in banks. Second, based on the possible contagion effects in financial conglomerates the SBIF enhanced the regulations restricting transactions with related debtors, increasing their supervision tools in this area. Third, in relation to funding structures, the Central Bank is reviewing the liquidity rules governing the banks in order to strengthen management policies in this field, include binding regulatory limits on a consolidated basis, standardize the assumptions of our own models, expand information disclosure to the market about the liquidity position of each bank and move towards the new Basel liquidity standards. Finally, the bill of law sent to the National Congress to institutionalize the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an important step, because it grants capabilities that provide more space to the authorities to monitor the risks facing the financial system and coordinate responses to them. To sum up, the Chilean economy is well positioned to address the changing internal and external conditions that we are already seeing. The adjustments observed in relative prices, the real exchange rate and interest rates have gone in the right direction to facilitate the adjustment of the economy. The Board follows closely the evolution of the external and domestic macroeconomic scenarios and their implications on inflation, and reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy in such a way that projected inflation stands at 3% in the policy horizon. At the same time, it will continue to improve financial legislation in order to maintain and enhance this resilience, in those issues that are legally mandated. Let me end with some final thoughts. Final thoughts As is customary in our presentations to the Senate, we have tried to present as clearly and transparently as possible our assessment of the current economic situation and its implications for managing the policy tools entrusted to us. Always keeping a watchful eye on the compliance of the mandates we have been given. The Chilean economy is on a good stand to face the challenges ahead, which certainly does not mean that we feel immune to whatever happens beyond our borders. We have managed economic policies seriously and responsibly in good times, which should allow us to move with relative ease through a not so favorable period.  The country’s domestic and external position is strong, our financial system has limited risks, and the monetary policy is in a position that, if necessary, can deal with a different, more complicated phase. In addition, a strong fiscal position with public debt that in net terms is virtually nil, something that not many countries can show.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  In the last two months we cut 50 basis points off the MPR, to 4.5 percent. The scenario that today we see as the most likely does not envisages the need for significant additional adjustments to the policy rate. However, in a different scenario where further adjustments are called for, there is the room and the will to carry them out. We, as the Central Bank, will continue to contribute with our assigned duty, that is, to safeguard the stability of our currency and the normal functioning of the internal and external payment system, to Chile’s development and welfare. Many thanks,

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, for the Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 16 December 2013. *      *      * Madam Chair,  Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a pleasure for me to be back in your committee at such a decisive moment. The next days and weeks until the end of this legislature will show whether the euro area will be able to take another key step towards banking union. I believe your institution can play a crucial and constructive role in ensuring that this next step will entail a truly European dimension. This is also the last time that I will discuss with you in detail matters related to the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Pending the appointment by the Council, Danièle Nouy will become the Chair of the Supervisory Board as of 1 January 2014. She will then also become your primary interlocutor with regard to the SSM. Today, I will first review recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area. I will then explain in greater detail our more recent monetary policy decisions and will present the progress in the preparations of the SSM. Economic and monetary developments Since our meeting in September, incoming information has confirmed the ECB’s assessment that underlying price pressures remain subdued over the medium term. The economic recovery in the euro area is fragile. Real GDP in the euro area expanded in the last two quarters: From July to September, it grew by 0.1% – quarter on quarter – following 0.3% in the second quarter of this year. Developments in survey-based confidence indicators up to November point toward a modest growth rate also in the last quarter of the year. At the same time, unemployment remains high. Necessary balance sheet adjustments in financial and non-financial sectors continue to weigh on economic activity. Looking further ahead, we expect output to continue to recover at a slow pace. This is in particular due to some improvement in domestic demand supported by our accommodative monetary policy. Euro area activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for exports. Moreover, the improvement in financial market conditions and reduced uncertainty seems to be gradually transmitted to the real economy. Finally, the progress made in fiscal consolidation has strengthened the confidence of markets in the resilience of the euro area. This should also positively affect the recovery. Nevertheless, the risks to the outlook remain on the downside. They are mainly related to uncertain developments in global money and financial market conditions. Higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and insufficient structural reforms in euro area countries could also negatively affect economic conditions. Annual HICP inflation increased in November to 0.9%, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, following an unexpectedly strong decline in October to 0.7%. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. We might experience a prolonged period of low inflation to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. This reflects the modest pace of the recovery and the fact that medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be anchored in line with price stability. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has stabilised at negative levels. Weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. Recent monetary policy decisions Based on this assessment of the current economic outlook, let me now explain in greater detail our more recent monetary policy decisions. In July this year, we introduced forward guidance to clarify the orientation of our monetary policy going forward in an exceptionally uncertain environment: we stated that we expected key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This statement was conditional on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, which is currently the case, as I have just explained. In line with our forward guidance, we decided in November to lower the key ECB interest rates further. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations was lowered by 25 basis points to 0.25% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 25 basis points to 0.75%. The rate on the deposit facility was left unchanged at 0.00%. Our forward guidance still remains in place: we continue to expect ECB key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. Thus, monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. Adjusting interest rates is not always sufficient to maintain price stability. In this crisis, interest rate cuts have been transmitted more slowly and unevenly across euro area countries due to the fragmentation of financial markets. To address this problem, we adopted in recent years a series of non-standard measures. The purpose of these was – and remains – a more effective transmission of the ECB’s interest rate cuts, so that our monetary policy can reach companies and households throughout the euro area. This was also the purpose of our decision in November to continue conducting all our refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at least until July 2015. Thus, we have helped to alleviate funding concerns of banks, which are still hesitant to lend to households and firms. Two years ago, we provided funding support to euro area banks through two Long Term Refinancing Operations with a maturity of three years each. As the funding situation of banks has improved significantly since then, banks have this year opted to repay about 40% of the initially outstanding amount. Accordingly, excess liquidity in overnight money markets has been gradually receding. We are monitoring the potential impact of these developments on our monetary policy stance. We are ready to consider all available instruments. As usual, it takes time before our policy decisions work their way through financial markets and affect the economy. The November decisions on interest rates, on forward guidance and on prolonging full allotment in all refinancing operations are working their way through. Financial markets have taken up our conditional commitment to an accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period of time. Money market term interest rates and yields on bank bonds declined. On the other hand, we are fully aware of the downward risks that a protracted period of low inflation entails. Consistent with its forward guidance, the Governing Council is ready and able to act if needed, as I mentioned at the most recent press conference . Furthermore, we currently see no signs of risks of financial imbalances related to the low interest rate environment. What we observe is still a very subdued trend in monetary and credit developments in the euro area. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Nevertheless, if we were to observe the build-up of such imbalances, this would be the field where macro-prudential authorities would have to intervene with market-specific instruments. Local risks have to be addressed by local instruments. This is why supervisory authorities, including the SSM, are now being equipped with the appropriate micro- and macro-prudential policy tools. I am confident that these will be used if necessary. State of play of SSM preparations Let me now update you on the latest developments establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which are well underway. Our internal preparations aim at ensuring that the ECB will be ready to assume its supervisory responsibilities in November 2014. We will make sure that the ECB’s monetary policy mandate focused on price stability will not be affected by considerations and decisions related to banking supervision. Internal rules are therefore being developed for the separation of monetary policy and supervisory functions: The units involved in decision-making will be clearly separated. We are putting in place an organisational set-up whereby the information flow between the two functions will be limited to a “need to know” basis. However, we will avoid unnecessary duplication of structures not involved in the decision-making process. This is cost-efficient, and I am sure you will appreciate this. As regards recruitment of staff, I can say that the process for senior and middle managerial positions is well underway. Further recruitment initiatives will start in due course. An important element of our preparations is the comprehensive assessment, which comprises a supervisory risk assessment, an asset quality review and a stress test performed in cooperation with the European Banking Authority (EBA). This exercise will increase transparency by enhancing the quality of information available. It will facilitate the repair of the sector by identifying the necessary corrective actions. And it will build confidence by assuring all stakeholders that banks are fundamentally sound. It will be concluded shortly before the ECB assumes supervisory responsibilities. The ECB convened a series of meetings in November in Frankfurt with the banks that will undergo the comprehensive assessment. These meetings were positively received and provided the useful opportunity to have a first exchange of views, to receive feedback on our communication, and respond to questions. We also explained that we would welcome prompt action from the banks, beginning now, to strengthen their balance sheets including profit retention and equity issuances. Other elements of the comprehensive assessment are on-going. The process for the selection of asset portfolios to be reviewed for the asset quality review was initiated in November, based on specific data collections. Furthermore, we expect to announce the key parameters of the stress test exercise together with the European Banking Authority (EBA) towards the beginning of next year. In this context, let me explain again the treatment of sovereign bonds: The Asset Quality Review is a valuation exercise where we will apply the current regulatory framework. It is not for us to change this framework – this is a global discussion, and the Basel Committee is the right forum for it. That said, we will of course “stress” a wide range of assets as part of the stress tests: Sovereign bonds will be among them. To ensure the credibility and rigour of the comprehensive assessment, backstops should be well specified and in place as soon as possible. The pecking order should be first private sources, then national public backstops and, as a last resort, European instruments. Turning now from supervision to resolution, I understand you have reached agreement with the Council on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. Let me again strongly welcome this agreement, as it is an important step towards to the completion of the Banking Union. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  However, for the credibility of the Banking Union, another step must be taken too: The SSM needs a strong and credible Single Resolution Mechanism as its counterpart. Responsibilities for supervision and resolution need to be aligned at the European level. Thus, I urge you and the Council to swiftly set-up a robust Single Resolution Mechanism, for which three elements are essential in practice: a single system, a single authority, and a single fund. We should not create a Single Resolution Mechanism that is single in name only. In this respect, I am concerned that decision-making may become overly complex and financing arrangements may not be adequate. I trust that the European Parliament, together with the Council, will succeed in creating a true Banking Union. Thank you for your attention. I am now looking forward to your questions.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Luis M Linde: Reflections on the road and challenges ahead – regulatory changes affecting banking activity Closing address by Mr Luis M Linde, Governor of the Bank of Spain, at the IX IESE (Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa/Business School of the University of Navarra) Banking Sector Meeting “Banks – beyond the crisis”, Madrid, 12 December 2013. *      *      * Firstly, let me thank Professor Juan José Toribio, the president of the Centro Internacional de Finanzas, for inviting me to participate in this IESE Banking Sector Meeting. And allow me to congratulate the IESE on this ninth edition of a forum that has become a classic and has consistently been of the greatest interest and highest calibre. I am not going to address certain matters that are very important and topical, such as the signs of recovery in the Spanish economy, the initial steps of the launch of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, or the asset quality review or stress tests for those banks that are to be supervised by the Single Mechanism. I would hardly have anything novel to say there.  Rather, I wish to review some aspects of the regulatory changes which, once the crisis has been overcome, are going to significantly affect banking activity.  Three matters concern us: the elements of the new Basel III capital accord that have not yet been fully finalised; the Financial Stability Board’s work on the regulatory framework for the treatment of systemically important institutions; and the new powers of the Banco de España under the draft bill on the supervision of credit institutions, which will foreseeably be approved in the first quarter of next year.  I shall begin with Basel III. The new capital accord improves the comparability and, thereby, the credibility of capital ratios. Basel III increases capital requirements with better-quality instruments, and it seeks consistency and a uniform application across banks and countries. It also adds two new prudential tools: one in the area of liquidity, and the other in that of leverage.  First, the inclusion of the leverage ratio, the relationship between Tier 1 capital and exposure both on and off the balance sheet, i.e. the total banking book, without taking into account risk weights. Calculations are made at the consolidated level and, in principle, the level is set at a minimum of 3%. It is scheduled to come into force in 2018, although an earlier date will probably be set for the required disclosure of this figure.  This new tool has been designed as a straightforward measure that complements and acts as a floor to the minimum risk-based capital ratio. It aims to provide additional protection against what is known as “model risk”, i.e. underestimating the regulatory capital needed further to a calculation using the sophisticated models allowed by Basel II and III.  On the more technical side, there appears to be agreement on the definition and calculation of the ratio, the treatment of derivatives and repos, and operations with CCPs. But doubts remain over its final calibration and how it affects certain business models, specifically those most centred on retail activity.  The Banco de España has supported the setting of this leverage ratio in Pillar 1 on the understanding that it can be a good prudential tool, once correctly calibrated. In this respect, the monitoring period prior to its entry into force will provide information and experience. Although European regulations envisage that countries may apply this ratio as they deem fit until its harmonisation in 2018, it is not the intention of the Banco de España, in principle, to bring forward its application.  As regards liquidity, Basel III has added new regulatory requirements: a short-term liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), and a long-term requirement, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches The short-term liquidity coverage ratio is designed so that banks may have an asset buffer with which to meet their maximum foreseeable liquidity or funding needs over a period of at least 30 days. As what is involved is a safety margin, this ratio might at times of stress be below 100% of such maximum foreseeable needs, which is the level demanded once the requirements come fully into force. However, if a bank’s liquidity-generating capacity stands at below 100% of the maximum foreseeable needs, it will be obliged to inform the supervisor, with which it will have to agree a plan to regain the 100% level.  The initial design of this ratio is very demanding and, perhaps, not very realistic. The year 2015 was too early a date for its full implementation, and the definition of “high-quality liquid assets” or the assumptions of liquidity needs were overly rigorous. Hence, in January 2012, the Basel Committee of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision revised the accord to widen the base of assets considered highly liquid and to soften the implementation timetable. This regulation is also practically finalised, at least in the Basel Committee, as an agreement on its design and calibration has already been reached.  The short-term ratio will not come into force immediately. It will be phased in from 2015 – when a level of 60% will be demanded – to 2019, when it will reach 100%. Nonetheless, this timetable may be speeded up at the discretion of the different national authorities.  The Banco de España has backed the setting of the short-term liquidity ratio, and the amendments to it, which have softened the original framework proposed. Nor does it intend to accelerate the implementation timetable, although we believe that banks should strive to meet it as soon as possible. As regards reporting and transparency obligations, we consider they should be obligatory for internationally active banks, but that they could be simplified for others.  Basel III also envisages the implementation of a long-term liquidity ratio so that banks maintain stable funding profiles, tailored to their assets and activities. In that way, banks’ dependence on short-term funding markets is structurally reduced, since that proved to be a very disruptive weakness in the 2008 financial crisis.   The design of this ratio is at a relatively early stage, as the preliminary proposal published in 2010 is being revised. It is expected that, early next year, a consultative document will be available, and that the regulations will have been finalised before 2015, with this entailing a simplification of the original rule. Further, it will be necessary to agree on certain aspects of relevance for Spanish banks, such as, in relation to liquidity requirements, the treatment of high-quality mortgages or matters pertaining to asset encumbrance. This ratio is expected to come into force in 2018, although in the case of the EU, the Commission will have to submit a legislative proposal before 2016.  I shall now move on to certain elements relating to the review of capital requirements. This is part of a broader project: to attempt to ensure that the benefits of risk-adjusted regulations, such as Basel III, are not achieved at the cost of introducing excessively complex regulations which, in addition to other problems, yield results that cannot be compared from one bank to another. The Banco de España is in favour of simplifying the current regulations, striking a balance between simplicity, comparability and risk-sensitivity. In this respect, it views favourably the transparency exercise conducted by the Basel Committee on the comparability of asset risk weights.  The results of this exercise allow an argument to be made for the need to lessen the differences between requirements obtained by applying the standard method and those calculated using internal models, so that the credibility of the solvency ratios should not be compromised. However, we believe they should not go so far as to abandon the use of internal models; rather, standardised models, based on parameters determined by the supervisors, should be used as a reference for internal models.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 I should also like to mention here the review of the treatment of the trading book, with the aim of reducing regulatory capital differences between this book and the banking book, thus avoiding regulatory arbitrage.  At the Banco de España we broadly concur with these lines of work. However, concerning the review of sovereign risk and in order to avoid undesirable effects and consequences for financial stability, we believe a wholesale approach should be taken, not one that is independent or isolated in respect of each working group.  As to the review of the current framework for the treatment of securitisations, I should like to underscore the importance of the calibration of capital requirements associated with securitisations not being excessively conservative, and that the reopening of these markets should not be hampered in an unwarranted fashion.  I would like to end my comments on the work of the Basel Committee by touching briefly on another regulatory matter currently under review, the treatment of large exposures. This falls within the field of prudential measures additional to the solvency ratio, which aim to ensure the survival of banks in extreme situations. The review focuses on the treatment of exposures to third parties, since that of intra-group exposures has been postponed for the time being. The general principle is that exposures to all counterparties should be subject to limits based on the capital of the bank.  That limit has been set generally at 25% of tier 1 capital, although for certain exposures, such as those between systemic banks, it is stricter. Notably, provision is made for the possibility, after an observation period, of limiting exposures to central counterparties (CCPs), although this matter is open and first requires an assessment of the effects of other rules governing relationships between banks and CCPs.   Let me now say a few words on some of the main regulatory projects on which the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is currently working, particularly that to promote a new regulatory framework for the treatment of systemically important institutions, i.e. those whose complexity, size and interconnectedness are such that their failure could cause serious problems to the global financial system. This new framework rests on four pillars: additional loss absorbency, effective resolution mechanisms, increased supervisory intensity and more resilient financial market infrastructure.  Unquestionable progress has been made in implementing this framework. In particular, the G-20 has approved, as a new international standard, the so-called Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, which have to be complied with in each jurisdiction.  In Spain, Law 9/2012 adopts and applies many of the principles set forth in the “Key Attributes”. Meanwhile, the European Union expects to adopt the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive by the end of the year, which will be an important step forward in fully implementing the “Key Attributes” in all Member States. On this last point, as you know Ecofin is currently discussing the Single Resolution Mechanism and the Resolution Fund. It seems that agreements, or draft agreements, are being reached and that progress is being made in the area of resolution, such as the determination of the competent authority. Also, in the more difficult and complicated issue of financing, headway is being made on the characteristics of the proposed Single Resolution Fund. Negotiations are following their course and an extraordinary Ecofin meeting is scheduled for next week to address these matters.  Let me now look at the new powers assigned to the Banco de España in the draft bill on credit institution supervision and solvency to be debated shortly. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Obviously all the functions and powers conferred on the Banco de España, which I will describe shortly, will have to be interpreted and implemented taking into account the powers of the European Central Bank in the framework of the implementation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. From the formal standpoint, the draft bill will consolidate in a kind of “Bank Code” all the regulatory provisions on the creation, activity and control of credit institutions, thus putting an end to the dispersion of legislation which has characterised the credit sector for various decades. Furthermore, the aforementioned consolidation aims to write into Spanish law the changes introduced in June 2013 by the so-called CRD-IV package, i.e. the Directive and the Regulation which incorporate the Basel III Accord into European legislation. As you know, that transposition has been partly handled by the promulgation of Royal Decree-Law 14/2013, which includes those matters considered essential for incorporation before 1 January 2014. Under the draft bill, and without prejudice to the framework resulting from the entry into force of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the Banco de España will retain its current power to authorise the exercise of banking activities. Moreover, it will receive additional powers, such as that to revoke banking licences. Regarding the regime governing the purchase of qualifying holdings in credit institutions, the Banco de España will continue to be the authority responsible for assessing the  proposals of potential purchasers, although now there are plans to give it powers of supervisory intervention, senior officer replacement, suspension of voting rights or, in extreme situations, licence revocation. As bank supervisor, the Banco de España will continue overseeing compliance with organisational and disciplinary regulations. To this end, the draft bill maintains its existing inspection and verification powers, although with some changes, such as that requiring the Banco de España to carry out yearly stress tests on supervised institutions to evaluate their solvency.  Additionally, in the context of the Banco de España’s prudential supervisory tasks, the draft bill equips it with certain tools envisaged in EU legislation, including the so-called Pillar 2 measures such as additional own funds requirements, limitations on dividend distribution, restriction of certain activities and limitation of variable compensation. The Banco de España will also be empowered to set the “additional capital margins” envisaged in the draft bill.  The Banco de España will continue drawing up supervisory guidelines. As a new development, it is envisaged that, if institutions’ conduct does not comply with the guidelines, they will, if required by the supervisor, have to explain the reasons for such non-compliance.  In the area of sanctions, the Banco de España retains its current powers, independently from the powers which may at any time be exercised by the European Central Bank within the framework of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Against this background, significant changes were made which generally strengthen the regime currently in force.  Finally, the draft bill endows the Banco de España with supervisory, inspection and sanctioning powers in respect of compliance with obligations to offset, notify and reduce risks associated with the use of OTC derivatives. To conclude: 2014 will, as we all know, be an extremely intense year as far as international financial regulation and supervision are concerned. There will be no lack of work. My best wishes to all of you and good luck. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Yuba Raj Khatiwada: Emerging global financial issues of common interest Welcome remarks by Dr Yuba Raj Khatiwada, Governor of the Central Bank of Nepal, at the 49th SEACEN Governors’ Conference/High-Level Seminar and 33rd Meeting of the SEACEN Board of Governors, Kathmandu, 21 November 2013. *      *      * Chief Guest Rt. Honorable President of Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, Dr. Ram Baran Yadav Honorable Minister of Finance, Mr. Shanker Prasad Koirala Chair of SEACEN Board of Governors and Governor of the Bank of Mongolia Mr. Naidansuren Zoljargal Fellow SEACEN Governors, Distinguished Keynote Speakers, Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen 1. It gives me a great pleasure to welcome all of you to this 49th SEACEN Governors’ Conference/High-Level Seminar and 33rd Meeting of the SEACEN Board of Governors being held in Kathmandu. I am thankful to the SEACEN Governors for trusting us to host this important event after 26 years. We last had the opportunity to host this important event in 1987 while I was myself a junior officer at the Nepal Rastra Bank. We are immensely delighted and feel highly honored to have the opportunity to host this important event and are overwhelmed by the gracious presence of Rt. Honorable President of Nepal, Honorable Minister of Finance, fellow Governors and other dignitaries. Ladies and Gentlemen 2. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate fellow Governors and collaborators on the occasion of 30th anniversary of the SEACEN Centre whereby our collective efforts along with other non-member contribution have taken the Centre to a greater height of recognition and pride. This is evident from the increased members including Asia’s largest and emerging economies, growing attraction for more membership, and increased capacity of the Centre in research and training. The Centre has also created a platform and an opportunity for all of us to discuss the emerging global financial issues of our common interest. I do expect continued support of my fellow Governors of the SEACEN Board and our collaborators in furthering the SEACEN Centre to the stage of great height and recognition. Ladies and Gentlemen, 3. In changing economic landscape, central banks are growingly entering in their  non-conventional roles; and we have been seeing a paradigm shift in our roles and responsibilities. The advent of recent global financial crisis has not only exposed more complex and intricate macro-financial linkages in the transmission mechanism of the monetary policy, this has also shifted our attention towards that of the financial stability and economic growth. Growing global financial integration, financial innovation and evolution of new financial products and massive use of electronic technology in financial services have made our job even more challenging. 4. Emerging Asian market economies are now characterized by rapid financial globalization andintegration which has contributed to increased volatility of capital flows and rapid transmission of financial crises. Deepening and broadening of the financial sector has created more financial risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system of our economies. The presence of informal markets and shadow banking which often leads to a weaker transmission of the monetary policy has made the central banks’ role more challenging. Increasing new financial products triggered by sophisticated information technology, massive 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches cross-border capital flows resulting to volatility in exchange rates and uncertainty of the spillover effect in the domestic economy are added challenges for we central bankers towards making our financial system more stable, inclusive, and economic growth friendly. 5. These challenges call upon the central bank authorities to recast monetary policy objectives and instrument, to strengthen regulation and supervision and exercise macro-prudential measures as a complement to monetary policy. Priority has to be accorded in identifying all the sources of risk and imbalance that can have systemic implications for the economy’s growth and stability. Our monetary policy also needs to address how financial resources are better allocated to promote growth and jobs along with ensuring macro-economic stability. Furthermore, there is a need to effectively integrate or coordinate monetary, regulatory and supervisory functions into coherent frameworks for the maintenance of financial stability and promotion of inclusive economic growth. 6. This 49th Governors’ Conference and High Level Seminar aims to discuss some of these pertinent issues. What we have learnt is that financial system can have robust growth and can be stable only in an environment of real economy growing in a sustainable manner. Thus a strategy to promote economic growth must be an integral part of the financial sector development strategy. Deliberations and discussions on these important subjects have drawn the interest of the global leaders including the central bankers and international financial institutions, particularly after the recent financial crisis. We will have the opportunity to hear thoughts and views on these relevant topics from the distinguished speakers from renowned institutions. I hope that it will be very much rewarding to all of us. 7. For many of you, this may be the first time in Nepal or you may be visiting Nepal after an interval. I hope that your stay in Nepal will be refreshing and memorable one. You will have an opportunity to explore more about our rich culture, nature and the friendly people during your stay and during the social events that would take place following the meetings. 8. Let me close my remarks by once again welcoming Rt. Honorable President, Honorable Finance Minister, fellow Governors and distinguished delegates to this 49th Governors’ Conference/High Level Seminar and the Meeting of Board of Governors in Nepal. I look forward to a rewarding discourse and exchange of views and experiences among fellow Governors which will help better deliver our central banking roles and responsibilities. Thank You 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Spencer Dale: The UK’s economic recovery – why now; will it last; and what next for monetary policy? Speech by Mr Spencer Dale, Executive Director, Monetary Policy, and Chief Economist of the Bank of England, at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) East of England Midwinter Lunch, Newmarket, 13 December 2013. *      *      * I would like to thank John Lewis, Matt Trott and Gavin Wallis for their considerable help in preparing this speech. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of other members of the Monetary Policy Committee. I thought I would start today with a short reminiscence about the late Eddie George, who was Governor of the Bank of England between 1993 and 2003. Soon after becoming Governor, Eddie gave an interview in which he was asked how he would judge the success of his Governorship. Now this was before the advent of the Monetary Policy Committee, so he couldn’t frame his response simply in terms of hitting the inflation target. Instead, Eddie replied that “My personal ambition is that the rate of growth of output should be above the rate of inflation for three years in a row”.1 At the time, this seemed a fairly tall order: prior to Eddie taking over, this hadn’t been achieved even once since the Second World War. But as it turned out, growth was stronger than inflation in every single year of Eddie’s 10-year reign. And that continued for the next few years after he’d retired. Indeed, during the halcyon days of the so-called Great Moderation that preceded the financial crisis, it started to seem that Eddie’s ambition was no longer quite so demanding. But – as you all know – then came the crisis! That, combined with a commodity price boom and a sharp depreciation in sterling, meant that the days of GDP growth outstripping inflation quickly became a thing of the past. We’ve failed to live up to Eddie’s ambition for each of the past six years. The good news is that recent developments – on both growth and inflation – mean that we appear to be heading back towards an environment of which Eddie would have approved. Over the past six months, output has grown at an annualised rate of almost 3%, almost a quarter of a million new jobs have been created and indicators point to a continuation of strong growth. At the same time, inflation has fallen sharply and, at 2.2% in October, CPI inflation is as low as it’s been for four years. In terms of growth, the obvious question this raises is, why now? Why, after throwing everything bar the kitchen sink at the economy over the past few years, has the economy started to grow only now? Even more importantly, will the recovery last? Having seen a few false dawns over recent years, has the recovery really taken hold this time? And what does all this mean for monetary policy. In particular, what does the MPC’s so-called forward guidance, which we announced in the summer, mean for you – the businessmen and women driving this recovery? And that’s the plan for today: to consider three key questions about the economic recovery that we’re now finally enjoying – why now, will it last, and what next for policy?                                                 1 Securities and Investment Review, September 1993. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Why now? First, why now? Why after several years of frustration and disappointment has the economy begun to grow? It’s hard to be certain: this time last year we were not predicting such a sharp turnaround in growth and there’s a danger of appearing to be wise after the event. But, at least with the benefit of hindsight, two developments in particular seem important in driving the turnaround: an easing in credit conditions; and a reduction in economic uncertainty. Let me say a few words about each, starting with credit conditions. Improved credit availability Although it’s still patchy and there’s further to go, we’ve observed a marked improvement in the ability of many companies and households to access credit over the past 18 months or so. Some of that stems from a lessening of tensions within the euro area, which has helped to ease pressures on banks both sides of the channel. It’s also been aided by domestic polices, including the Funding for Lending scheme, a series of regulatory actions to improve the strength and resilience of our banking system and, more recently, the Government’s Help-to-Buy policies. I fully recognise that the ability of many SMEs – perhaps many of you here today – to access credit at reasonable rates still remains impaired. But even here my sense is that some progress has been made. That’s the message from surveys of small businesses, from reports by the Bank’s Agents, and indeed that I get from my own conversations with many businesses around the country. We’re not there yet – and the Funding for Lending scheme remains in place to encourage banks to lend more to companies, particularly SMEs – but we have taken a step in the right direction. For households, the improvement has been more marked. Interest rates of new mortgages, especially those for fixed-rate mortgages and those with higher loan-to-value ratios, have fallen by well over a percentage point since the summer of 2012. Unsecured personal loan rates have fallen by even more. The greater ease with which many families can access credit has fed through to the housing market, which until recently had been in a state of deep freeze. Housing transactions fell very sharply in the wake of the financial crisis and subsequently flat lined. Nominal house prices moved sideways for several years. But over the past six months or so, there’s been some thawing. Housing transactions and mortgage approvals have started to show signs of life. House prices have picked up. A healthy housing market is good for our economy and will help to support the recovery. Most importantly, it will underpin further increases in house building, which has played an important role in driving the economic growth we’ve enjoyed this year and which, as a nation, we need to see. It will foster greater labour mobility by allowing people to move more easily to where new jobs are being created. It will help to support consumer confidence. But let’s not be naive. Anyone with more than a passing interest in British economic history is aware that the UK housing market has a sort of microwave type quality to it, with a tendency to turn from lukewarm to scalding hot in a matter of a few economic seconds. The Bank is fully aware of this risk. The good news, however, is that it’s far better equipped to respond to these types of risks than in the past. In particular, the new Financial Policy Committee (FPC) – the sister Committee to the MPC – has explicit responsibility for maintaining the resilience of the financial system. And, together with the other regulatory bodies, the FPC has the policy instruments which can address potential excesses in the housing market – and in other markets – which pose a threat to the stability of the financial system. So although there are risks and there is further to go, particularly for SMEs, credit conditions for many companies and households have eased over the past 18 months and this has helped to stimulate activity, particular so within the housing market. Consider next the reduction in economic uncertainty which has probably played a greater role in turning the economy around this year. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Reduced economic uncertainty It seems clear that economic uncertainty has diminished over the past year or so. Think back, for example, to the middle of last year, when the euro area appeared once again to be teetering on the edge. Or even as recently to the beginning of this year, when all the talk at home was of the possibility of a triple dip. To some, appealing to “reduced uncertainty” as a driver of the economic recovery may sound rather vague and nebulous. A convenient ex post rationalisation perhaps for something we don’t really understand. But it seems clear to me that uncertainty and fear greatly amplified the initial impact of the financial crisis.2 How else, for example, can we explain the speed with which a failure of a US investment bank in September 2008 led to output and orders up and down our country, and indeed around the world, “falling off a cliff” within a matter of months?3 More generally, speaking to companies over recent years, I’ve been left in no doubt that heightened uncertainty has served as a significant brake on their activity and plans for expansion. And for good reason. Most obviously, when faced with greater uncertainty about the economic outlook, many companies may hold off undertaking new investments or starting new ventures and wait for the uncertainty to be partially resolved before deciding whether or not to go ahead. The value of waiting – or keeping your options open – is especially marked when considering lumpy investment projects which are hard or costly to reverse once made.4 Uncertainty may delay actions and investment within companies, even if managers are not waiting for it to be resolved. Take, for example, a company deciding whether to invest in, say, a new IT system. It may be that at current levels of orders and activity, it’s too close to call whether this investment will pay off, and so the decision is put on hold until orders increase sufficiently to tip the balance decisively. But suppose the economic outlook is particularly uncertain, so the company is very unsure whether, even if orders were to rise, that strength would continue. In that case, the company is likely to require an even bigger increase in orders before taking the plunge. As a result, heightened levels of uncertainty will tend to push down on aggregate investment.5 More generally, many companies faced with a more uncertain economic outlook may adopt a defensive strategy, hunkering down to ensure that they survive the economic storm. Sure, this may mean deferring potentially profitable business opportunities for a while, but better that than risk your long-term future. In this context, it’s worth remembering that it’s the most                                                 2 For more a detailed discussion of the role increased uncertainty may have played in contributing to the depth of the recession, see the recent article by Abigail Haddow, Chris Hare, John Holley and Tamarah Shakir (2013) in the Bank of England’s Quarterly Bulletin. 3 This phrase was used by Mervyn King in evidence to the Treasury Select Committee in November 2009: “At the beginning of the year we had experienced two quarters when the world economy, in the words people around the world have used, fell off a cliff”. 4 For example, Dixit and Pindyck (1994) show that for a company to undertake an investment project its net present value must not merely be positive, but must be greater than the implied option value of waiting until the next period. 5 Bloom (2009) shows that higher uncertainty tends to lead to lower investment because it widens the “zone of inaction” associated with companies waiting for the economic environment to move decisively in once direction or the other. The partial irreversibility of investment means that there are more companies at the margin deciding whether to invest than those at the corresponding disinvestment margin. Widening this region of inaction causes more new investments than disinvestments to be cancelled, and hence lowers total investment. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  successful companies with the brightest futures that are likely to be most affected in this way, since they have the most to lose.6 As I said, the good news is that the cloud of uncertainty has started to lift. And just as heightened uncertainty greatly amplified the downturn, this reduction in uncertainty can provide a powerful spur to the recovery. This leads to our second question for today: will the recovery last? Will it last? The reduction in uncertainty and the easing of credit conditions appear to have started to unlock pent-up demand and so fuel a recovery. That recovery to date has been largely driven on the household side: high-street sales have increased modestly as consumers have spent a greater share of their pay, and investment in residential housing has increased significantly. The dominant role of the household sector in the early stages of the recovery is not particularly surprising: businesses are likely to need a sustained pickup in demand before they have either the need or the confidence to increase capacity. But the durability of the recovery will depend on the baton of growth being handed over to the corporate sector, whose spending and investment will help to foster stronger growth in productivity and real incomes. And here the reduction in uncertainty may continue to play an important role. It’s perhaps easy to see how reduced uncertainty may help to prompt a one-off increase in business spending, as companies move away from defensive, wait-and-see strategies and blow the cobwebs off plans for deferred investment projects. But the impact of diminished uncertainty may stretch beyond simply a short-run boost. In part that reflects the possibility that the combination of reduced uncertainty and increased spending by households and companies may become self-reinforcing: reduced uncertainty helps to spur additional spending and investment, which in turn further reduces uncertainty about future demand and so on.7 Movements in uncertainty can amplify the recovery just as they amplified the downturn. This virtuous circle may be enhanced by the benefits reduced uncertainty can have for the supply-side of our economy. Increased investment will add to our productive capacity. A strengthening labour market may give employees confidence to move jobs, so better aligning available skills with vacancies. Companies may lift the shutters and start to take the types of risks and entrepreneurial activities necessary for our long-run prosperity.8 Such improvements in the supply performance of our economy would greatly enhance the durability of the recovery. Diminished uncertainty may also bolster the impact from the past easing in monetary policy. The MPC has loosened monetary policy aggressively since the financial crisis, both by cutting Bank Rate to historically low levels and by the use of more unconventional tools, such                                                 6 The costs associated with bankruptcy means that, in times of high uncertainty, a firm may opt to adopt a strategy which is most robust to their view about the world being proved wrong, sometimes referred to as “robust satisficing” (See Ben Haim (2010) for an overview). 7 My colleague David Miles (2013) made a similar point in a recent speech. 8 Bloom et al (2001), Bond and Lombardi (2004) and Gilchrist et al (2010) all discuss the constraining impact uncertainty can have on business investment. Reduced uncertainty may also make companies more willing to enter new markets. Disney, Haskel and Heden (2003) provide evidence that such activities are an important source of productivity growth. Lazear and Spletzer (2011) show that reduced uncertainty can prompt greater “churn” in the labour market leading to more efficient matching of skills to jobs. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  as Quantitative Easing and the Funding for Lending scheme. But if, over recent years, many companies have been largely focussed on survival, waiting for some of the uncertainty to be resolved before actively considering opportunities to invest and expand, it’s possible that the easing of borrowing costs brought about by these policies has not yet fully translated into spending decisions. As uncertainty lessens, past monetary policy actions may gain greater traction, thus further supporting the recovery. So there are good reasons for thinking that the reduced uncertainty may help to facilitate this handover to business spending we need to see, and that some of those effects may be long lasting. But we also need to be alive to the possibility that the events of the past few years may colour and contaminate business behaviour for many years to come. It may be a long time before companies look ahead with the same confidence that they did during the period of remarkable stability prior to the crisis. Before their trust is restored that the authorities are able to stop really bad things from happening. Before they rebuild their relationships with their banks. On this final point, many companies were let down by their banks during the financial crisis, and I fear that many will be reluctant to return to a business model which relies on their banks providing liquidity and support in times of need. The reluctance today of some companies to borrow from their banks may be less a lack of demand and more a breakdown of trust. Although an understandable response to the events of the past few years, an increased prevalence of self-insurance is not good for the efficient functioning of our economy. The scarring effects of the financial crisis and the uncertainty it brought with it, together with the fiscal consolidation and the weakness of the euro area, are likely to continue to weigh on the recovery over the next few years. Yes: our economy appears to have turned a corner. And yes: there are good reasons for optimism that the recovery will persist. But we can’t take it for granted: there’s still a long way to go. And that sense of how far there is to go underpins the policy guidance provided by the Committee earlier this year and takes us to our third and final question: what next for monetary policy? What next for monetary policy? The primary objective of monetary policy remains to hit the Government’s 2% target for CPI inflation. Despite missing the target for much of the past five years, I’ve no doubt that the credible nominal anchor it provided served our economy well during the crisis. Indeed, without that credibility it wouldn’t have been possible to loosen monetary policy as aggressively as we did in order to support output and jobs. As we have seen, the good news is that inflation has fallen sharply over the past few months and the 2% target is now in sight for the first time in over 4 years. But this isn’t a time for complacency. To repeat, inflation has been above the 2% target for most of the past five years. There are good reasons why policy wasn’t tightened in order to bring inflation back to target more quickly. But ultimately, the MPC will be judged by the success of our actions, not the elegance of our arguments. We need to demonstrate our commitment to bring inflation back to target and to keep it there. But we have also needed to trade off the speed with which we bring inflation back to target against the support that monetary policy can provide to the recovery. The MPC’s forward guidance gives greater clarity about our view of the appropriate trade-off. More important for us today, our guidance is rooted in the recognition that it’s a long way back to the economy being fully recovered. The damage and losses associated with the financial crisis and the years of frustration and disappointment that followed won’t be reversed simply by one or two quarters of strong growth. Our guidance makes clear that we intend to maintain the current exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy until we’ve 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  seen a sustained period of strong growth and the margin of slack in the economy has narrowed significantly, as long as this does not pose risks to either price or financial stability. As you may know, our guidance was framed in terms of so-called thresholds and knockouts. The MPC intends not to raise Bank Rate or reduce the stock of asset purchases at least until the unemployment rate reaches a threshold of 7%, subject to three knockouts designed to guard against risks to price and financial stability. But abstracting from the details of these thresholds and knockouts, our message to you – the businessmen and women driving this recovery – is clear. You can plan for the future in the knowledge that the MPC intends to keep interest rates low until we have seen a prolonged period of strong growth, unemployment is significantly lower, real incomes are higher. Based on some of the reporting, you might be forgiven for thinking that forward guidance is far more complicated than this. To take just one example, let me read to you the opening sentence of an article last month reporting on the MPC’s November Inflation Report. Under the headline “Forward guidance fails”, the article began: “The Bank of England now expects the economy to grow strongly next year, highlighting the fact that its policy of forward guidance has effectively failed.” Strong growth, falling unemployment: if that’s failure, I wish I’d failed long before now! The aim of the Committee’s guidance isn’t to provide a commitment that interest rates won’t rise until some particular date in the future. Monetary policy has to respond to the changing state of the economy. We can no more commit to keeping our prices and quantities unchanged irrespective of economic circumstances than you can. Rather, our guidance should reassure you that, absent risks to either price stability or financial stability, we will tighten policy only when we are well along the road to recovery. Yes: interest rates will rise at some point. But only against a far stronger economic backdrop, when your output is higher, your order books are fuller, and you and your customers are better able to withstand a rise in borrowing costs. Moreover, although still some way in the distance, we shouldn’t look at the prospect of an eventual rise in interest rates with a sense of dread and fear. Assuming that interest rates rise due to the vigour and durability of the recovery, rather than concerns about either inflation or financial stability, we should see interest rates beginning to rise as a sign of the strength of our economy. As a sign that that we are well on the way to making a full recovery. As a sign that the emergency life-support measures put in place since the crisis are no longer required. The MPC is fully aware that extraordinary low interest rates are likely to be needed for some time yet. But when they cease to be, this will be a sign that we have finally turned the corner for home. Conclusion Let me summarise At long last, we appear to be moving back to an economic environment of which Eddie would have approved. One in which the economy is growing robustly and inflation is close to target. A recovery appears to have finally taken hold, spurred by reduced uncertainty and easier credit conditions. There are good reasons for optimism that the recovery will be durable. But the journey back to full recovery is long and many challenges still remain. Monetary policy is there for the long haul. That is the essence of our forward guidance.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Rundheersing Bheenick: Looking beyond vision 2020 Address by Mr Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Annual Dinner in honour of Economic Operators, Pailles, 6 December 2013. *      *      * “Without … extra resources, the only OMO’s that your Central Bank will be able to undertake will be, not Open Market Operations, but Open Mouth Operations – with no money to put where our mouth is!”  1. Before we begin may I ask you all to rise to pay our respects and tribute to that great leader in this region, Nelson Mandela, who passed away last night and whose character and example in his Long Walk to Freedom have inspired so many in Africa and the world. Nelson Mandela, Madiba, Thank you! Now let me welcome you all here tonight. For I want to bring some cheer to a year marked, once again, by the dismal lingering legacy of the global financial crisis. Tonight, I want us to raise our vision from the immediate past, beyond the immediate horizon, and even beyond Vision 2020, to a longer-term perspective for the country and for its people.  Global revenge on the banksters abroad 2. For banksters abroad, it has been a year of retribution, regulatory condemnation, and multi-billion-dollar penalties: their just deserts! But here, in Mauritius, it has been different. We have suffered no contagion from questionable practices and misdemeanors which had become common currency in the top echelons of global banking and finance. By judicious regulation, by innovative intervention, by much prudent action by our banks themselves − and also, I must say, by a fair bit of luck − we have managed to avoid the calamitous plight of so many hard-hit countries in the world.  3. The Economist, examining some of the worst excesses of casino banking abroad, has declared that to politicians – not with us tonight –  “banks are both incompetent behemoths waiting for public bailouts and conniving profiteers, pulling a fast one on their customers”1   The Economist might think that… But I could not possibly say so… could I? As we well know, our banks, here, are not too-big-to-fail, and are engagingly customer-friendly, most of the time. And they had better be, as I am pleased to see that the competition is really hotting up. Even as I speak, we have half a dozen different applications for bank licenses pending – a record number for us.  4. Elsewhere, bankers have traded recklessly − with other people’s money. They have been guilty of LIBOR rigging. You would have thought that the forex market – the largest and most liquid market in the world, with a daily trading volume of USD 4 trillion – would have been immune to market-rigging. Well, you would have been wrong! Bank forex trading desks fixed that, too. Bankers may yet be found guilty of commodity price rigging as well. They have made whole countries broke from the huge cost of the bank bailouts, spreading misery and devastation. You know, it’s almost as if these foreign banksters and traders have taken that Hollywood vamp, Mae West, as their mentor. Remember her quip?  “Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before.”  5. The jury is still out, as they say, on the punishment for bank fraud. Business Week, in November this year, estimated that US banks have paid out USD 93 billion in fines and                                                 1 The Economist, 27 July 2013 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  penalties. The toll is still rising. Early this week, EU antitrust authorities fined eight banks a combined total of USD 2.5 billion for collusion to manipulate benchmark interest rates. Some in the West are now in jail. Four Iranian bank fraudsters copped the death penalty last year. And the Wall Street Journal reports that over 450 US banks have failed since 2008.  6. In the UK, Barclays has paid out over USD400 million in fines to US regulators. It also sacrificed its Chairman and Chief Executive. Little wonder, then, that the UK Parliamentary Commission on Bank Standards proposes to criminalise reckless misconduct in bank management and has recommended that all bankers should be licensed and sign up to standard rules.  7. But I suppose one thing that can be said after all this litany of misdemeanors and malfeasance, is that banking is no longer a boring subject. We have certainly all become more financially-savvy. Who would have thought that grand larceny on a global scale would have had such a favourable impact on financial literacy?  A makeover for the real economy 8. But, tonight, it is not my intention to pillory the banksters abroad. We can safely leave that to the fearsome foreign regulators, the civil courts, and in some cases the criminal courts. Indeed the regulators, exacting such heavy fines, seem to be following the advice Ivana Trump gave to wronged wives:  “Don’t get mad: get everything!”   Moving closer home, some believe that a bash like this dinner tonight could not be complete without a dose of bank bashing – I wonder why? Let me assure you there is no such item on the menu tonight! What a sigh of relief I hear from our bankers present here! My subject tonight is the real economy in Mauritius and its future. Does it need a makeover?  Lifting our eyes to the future 9. How well are we doing? Let us step back a little to gain some perspective. Let’s measure our progress against the where we thought we would be in our Vision 2020 some fifteen years ago, which I had the privilege to develop with many of you. Many of you, present here tonight, contributed to developing Vision 2020, as we looked ahead to what our country could become in the span of 25 years. Ownership could not have been more widespread. In what was probably a unique feature, Vision 2020 bridged the party-political divide. Conceived and conducted under Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth – who actually attended a working meeting with his entire Cabinet − it was delivered under the Prime Ministership of Dr Navin Ramgoolam who gave it a ringing endorsement in an enthusiastic preface, commending the final report to the nation.  10. Vision 2020 has remarkable come to pass. Since December 1990, our GDP has grown nine-fold, while GDP per capita shot up from Rs37,000 to Rs266,000 − more than seven times. We were spot on when we predicted that tourism and ICT would emerge as major contributors to jobs and incomes. They now account for an average of 8.2% and 6.4% of GDP. In parallel, King Sugar has been dislodged from its pedestal, falling from 10.3% of GDP in 1990 to just 1.6% in 2012. Manufacturing also fell from 23.6% to 16.7%. As anticipated, our economy transformed into a more service-oriented economy, with the weight of the services sector increasing from 57% in 1990 to 73% in 2012. Our openness and readiness to adapt to globalisation pressures to maintain our competitiveness, saw us judiciously combining foreign labour with the domestic labour force. The share of foreign labour in total employment thus increased from 0.2% in 1990 to 4.1% in 2012. Our transformation has been remarkable.  11. I believe that Vision 2020 served as a guiding star for our economic operators and policy-makers as we set out on separate, but convergent, ways to address the succession of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  obstacles that we encountered. Obstacles, of course, there will always be. The international environment confronting us today is extremely challenging. Uncertainty has increased. So has competition for market share as countries adjust to the new competitive requirements of global supply chains.  12 As we edge our way out of the still-lingering financial crisis, I believe the time is ripe for us to embark on a new visioning project to look Beyond Vision 2020 to realise the further promise of our potential. Our public-private partnership has gained in maturity. I see no reason why a thriving private sector cannot take the lead in setting our perspective for the future. Don’t wait for government. Set up your own think-tank on strategic issues. Let the government be the facilitator of change. I believe that we have now reached a stage of development where we can best flourish with government responding to your strategy, your initiatives, and your vision. This is my call to our private sector partners tonight, re-echoing the call at the launch of Vision 2020, that the private sector should take the lead in future national visioning exercises.  Extending the miracle 13. We might begin by asking how well are we responding to current challenges. A new IMF working paper on Mauritius, tauntingly entitled “Mauritius: The Drivers of Growth – Can the Past be Extended”?2 examines our growth record as the economy revved up from an average growth rate of 2.4% in the 1960’s to 6% in the 1970’s, to then decelerate to 4.4% in the 2000’s. It uses the growth-accounting framework to decompose the respective contributions of capital and labour. It dissects the sources of past growth, and projects growth to 2030. It concludes that growth will most likely be in the 3–4% range. It could possibly reach 5% but this can only happen if strong pro-active policies are taken in five areas. First is an increase in investment rates. Second comes an increase in savings rates. Third is labour market reform. Fourth is education reform. And fifth is the need for further reforms to reduce bottlenecks and increase productivity. Except for the much-needed increase in our domestic savings rate, now alarmingly below 15% − or nearly half its historical peak – the measures are of a structural nature and not within the domain of monetary policy. The Bank has long been fighting to normalise interest rates to induce a greater savings effort but much of the time, as you are aware, it has unfortunately been a losing battle.  14. To return to the question put, can the past Mauritian “miracle” – be extended into the future? How are our institutions faring? Are we getting the best from our state-owned enterprises? They command such a large chunk of our national resources that they impact national competitiveness. Are we doing enough bench-marking with the best in the world?   How far are our firms cutting costs, increasing competitiveness, and improving productivity? Embarrassing as some of the answers may be, such questions must be confronted head-on so that “the miracle”, if such it is, can be projected for generations to come?  15. The message of the past is adaptation or disaster. In the last two decades, in both commerce and banking, we have been confronted by seeming miracles of technological change. We have had the microchip, the fibre-optic cable, the World Wide Web, satellite media, the smart phone, CCTV systems, videoconferencing, call centres, on-line sales, nano-technology, and so on and on. Some of you have been quick to pick up the kit and adapt it to your needs, but much of the old Mauritius still surrounds us, with a reluctance to change.                                                  2 Svirydzenka K., and M. Petri, “Mauritius: The Drivers of Growth – Can the Past be Extended?”, IMF Working Paper, October 2013 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Innovations in banking 16. In banking, I am pleased to report, we are in the midst of, not merely a spring cleaning, but a veritable banking reformation. It is a reformation that embraces the instant digital process of trade in bills of exchange, letters of credit, and the emergence of a global payments and settlements system. Mobile payments, electronic wallets, and internet banking are here to stay. We are moving into paperless banking and, indeed, to a cashless society. A new digital currency, Bitcoin, made headlines this year, challenging governments’ monopoly in the issuance of currency. Which means that even the new polymer notes may go the way of the Dodo. The financial management of commerce and banking is now being transformed in a generation by the very best in the business. But if we are all to be part of this new Mauritian miracle, then we must beware of being left out. The legacy of the global crisis: central banks taking a hit 17. Even as we ready up to face new threats, the legacy of the global crisis is still very much with us. Many central banks themselves have taken a hit. First, the revenue we derive from our reserves portfolio, which is the only source of revenue for the central bank, came tumbling down. It fell from Rs 2.1 billion in FY 2006/07 to Rs 794 million in FY 2012/2013 as the average annual yield declined from 4.4% to 0.8% over the same years. Second, is the hefty bill that came with the 2012 rescue job which the Bank had to do to protect our inherently vulnerable small economy from the global crisis. Allow me to sketch in the reality and cost of the action we had to take to prop up the economy and maintain financial stability in Mauritius.  18 The rupee was getting out of line with our economic fundamentals, gradually becoming overvalued, and beginning to affect trade. We had no option but to step up our intervention on the forex market to combat currency appreciation. We had very limited firepower – a fact not obvious at the time to some policy-makers who were inclined to believe that the Bank could just print all the rupees required to buy up the flow of foreign currencies. The constraint came from the other leg of the operation. To prevent the disruptive effects of the flood of rupee liquidity on financial and banking sector stability, the Bank had to buy up the rupees by issuing its own instruments. The cost of these instruments was a multiple of the yield on the currencies purchased. By way of example, let us take US dollars: reserves in this currency yielded 0.3% on average in 2012. The average cost incurred by the Bank to sterilise the proceeds of forex purchases stood at 3.4% in the same year – that is ten times higher.  19. Central Bank losses were expected and very much at the heart of our initial reluctance to intervene. We had support from the IMF who recommended that the cost of the process of sterilisation should be borne by the fiscal authorities up front, without waiting to recapitalise the central bank after it has incurred the losses. It was on that understanding, that we issued more than twice the volume of Bank securities than our normal level. That was indeed more than ten times our capital holdings. Our 2012 rescue job on the currency front cost us nearly Rs20 billion in Bank paper – that is ten times our capital. But it seems to be working although we are not yet out of the woods.  ORR to the rescue 20. Our rapid response, with the Operation Reserves Reconstitution, halted and reversed the appreciation of the rupee, kept the export machine going and the economy purring along normally. But the Central Bank took quite a hit. And I must emphasise tonight that neither the pace nor the level of the ORR-style intervention can be sustained by the Bank on its own resources.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The fiscal expectations of the monetary agent 21. We were, of course, not alone in being forced to play such an active interventionist role – and in paying for the consequences. Brazil protested that a “currency war” had been declared surreptitiously. It slapped taxes on inward capital flows. The Swiss central bank almost lost its shirt in trying, successfully, to contain appreciation of its currency, much to the displeasure of its cantonal shareholders. Last month, the Australian government made a massive capital transfer to the Reserve Bank of Australia to allow it to sustain its Open Market Operations. India suffered a severe bout of rupee depreciation, together with capital outflows. Zimbabwe has just taken over the debts of its central bank – but that is another story.  22. When “tapering” begins in earnest, the world will have to confront the new challenge of returning to a “normal” monetary policy. It’s a safe bet that still more currency volatility will follow, and even more vigorous action will be necessary to stabilise the affected currencies. But central bank balance sheets cannot keep taking hits like this. They cannot continue to rescue private sector balance sheets, prop up the economy, but go under themselves, with unsustainable losses. Central banks need to have up some extra cards their sleeve.  23. Topmost among these, I would place additional capitalisation, or resourcing, of central banks, as in Australia, without waiting for them to actually make losses first, as is the norm in central bank legislation. Dynamic provisioning, which flies in the face of accounting practice, is equally important. This would allow us to carry on the battle against currency volatility, conduct Open Market Operations, or OMO’s, in the low-yield environment. Without these extra resources, the only OMO’s that your Central Bank will be able to undertake will be, not Open Market Operations, but Open Mouth Operations – with no money to put where our mouth is!  24.  As I reflect on the timing of “tapering”, an astute observation of a former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, William McChesney Martin (Jr), comes to mind:  “The job of the FED is to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting going.”   I suspect that the macroprudential measures, that we introduced recently, to minimise the risk of overheating in the construction sector, must have evoked similar sentiments in the industry. The Bank is now seen as the killjoy, preventing enthusiastic promoters from turning the whole country into a gigantic building site. Where they see only benefits, the Bank sees Risk, with a capital R.  Igniting the new engines of growth 25. But let us not end on a dismal note for my hopes are high for a steady recovery. I believe Mauritius can move into the premier league of small states, and become one of the Tigers of tomorrow’s commerce, by igniting new engines of growth.  26. Writing, in the 1940’s, William Henry Beveridge, social reformer extraordinaire, defined the road to progress as the elimination of the five giants, of want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness. We have done much in Mauritius to eliminate want, disease, and squalor. We still have much work ahead to tackle more vigorously the giants of ignorance and idleness. We absolutely must increase savings; reform the public sector and make it more a servant than a master of the people; engage women more in our society, in our businesses and indeed in our banks; extract greater efficiency in education and health; and develop greater productivity and innovation in our economy.  27. I believe we shall see the drivers of growth sustained but we must do more, much more, to ignite innovation in business and in Mauritian society at large. The Mauritian miracle is not just a thing of the past. But it requires a new spirit of adventure to match our talents to the opportunities of the cyber age. We must overcome the new threats through a concerted 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  pursuit of macro-economic and macro-prudential policy. Only then can we secure economic and financial stability and growth with equity.  The keys to our future prosperity 28. The keys to the future are increased personal and corporate accountability and multi-sector collaboration. We need the private sector to take a lead role. We need more stimulation and nurturing of new start-ups. We need to challenge the monopolies of the past. We need a slimmer, more effective and efficient public sector, which is seriously in need of reform. Some task there! For it has been well said:  “Reorganising the civil service is like drawing a knife through a bowl of marbles.”  29. But in racing ahead on this path, holding forth the torch of new technology, we must face up to the many risks of the cyber age. And in this, I am pleased to see, many of our brightest bankers are taking a lead. For, above all we need the continuing positive role of our highly competitive banking sector in an even closer and more effective working relationship with the real economy. And we need more inclusive management in the public and the private sector. Here I’m reminded of the story of that great British military leader, the Duke of Wellington, who vanquished Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo in 1815. Later he became Prime Minister and found government to be a harder nut to crack. After his first Cabinet meeting, he was heard to remark:  “I gave them my orders, and then, damn it, they just sat down and started to discuss them all!”  Hats off to our local bankers 30. So, let’s now take our hats off to our local bankers! They have never been part of casino banking. And they have a long history of serving the nation through their customers. As a central bank we are proud of our 46-year history: just imagine how much more so must be les grandes dames de la Place d’Armes!. MCB inaugurated here in 1838; HSBC in 1916; and Barclays in 1919. That is a span of over 175 years, with decades and decades of experience and skill, serving the people of this country. The State Bank of Mauritius − which as many may not be aware, was actually promoted by the Bank of Mauritius just after the country’s independence − is an upstart by comparison. And a very successful one, too. The brilliant new stars on the banking scene are keeping our established bankers all on their toes. I say to our bankers here tonight, Hats off to you all.  The fundamental laws of the unproductive state 31. Finally, as is my wont on these occasions, may I leave you with two laws which may possibly inspire us in the pursuit of a second Mauritian miracle. In the past you have been served: Maradona’s law of interest rates, Einstein’s law of success, and Newton’s law on physical response, amongst others. For your delectation, I even rolled out Sutton’s law, named after a bank robber where he explained why he robbed banks.  32. In the same vein, I now turn to Parkinson – no, I am not referring to the Parkinson who gave his name to a debilitating disease which figures high on the risk map of humans in advancing years. I am invoking another Parkinson, Cyril Northcote Parkinson, who turned his attention to an equally-debilitating disease affecting, not persons, but institutions and corporates. Parkinson’s Law of Triviality may strike home for some habitués of board rooms. It states that:  The time spent by a committee on any item on the Agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum of the money involved.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  33.  This is where a trivial item, like the allocation of parking spaces, or the colour of new uniforms for staff, dominates discussion at the Board. This leaves no time to review strategic items such as a multibillion capital scheme. The big issue is then waved through on the nod. Members of the Board have exhausted themselves over the triviality and realise they must now break off for lunch!  34. Now, as we approach a festive season, when traders vie with one another with sales gimmicks, I thought I should do the same with our persiflage. May I therefore offer you two laws for the price of one? I am coupling the Law of Triviality with Parkinson’s Law of the Organisational Pyramid. It states that:  The number of subordinates in any organisation will increase linearly by 5% a year, regardless of the amount of work to be done.   We might call this the middle age spread of the middle income trap!  35. Finally, as I leave you ruminate over Parkinson’s Laws, I shall conclude, that such ineffable laws stand as warnings to us all. But if we can escape their pernicious embrace, I believe, our long-term future can be just as miraculous as our past. To achieve this, we must work together. We must put aside trivialities. And, above all, we must give strategic thinking and visioneering, priority on the national Agenda of economic operators and political decision-makers. It is high time to look beyond Vision 2020.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Deepali Pant Joshi: NISM Conference on ethics and corporate governance Speech by Dr Deepali Pant Joshi, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the National Institute of Securities Markets Conference on ethics and corporate governance, Kolkata, 11 December 2013. *      *      * Introduction At the outset, let me congratulate the organisers for this topical choice of subject, one which concerns us all. I thank Director, National Institute of Securities Markets, Dr Sandip Ghose and the Institute of Company Secretaries for having me here and my dear friend, Prashant Saran, for that brilliant opening address, which quite sets the tone for this panel. Que custodiet ipso custodes? Who will guard the guards ? Over the last two decades, corporate governance has attracted a great deal of public interest, it is now widely appreciated that this is critical for the economic health of Corporations and of larger society. The headlines of newspapers of the past few years in particular, portray a dismal story of lack of corporate ethics: Satyam, Enron, falling stock markets, corporate failures, dubious accounting practices, abuses of corporate power, criminal investigations reflect that the entire economic system on which investment returns depend is showing signs of infirmity and stress that have undermined investor confidence. Almost as if checks and balances that should protect our interests are pushed to one side, driven by the overwhelming need to move fast in relentless pursuit of profits. Notably some failures were the result of fraudulent accounting and other illegal practices, others were just bad governance. Company Boards or Old Boy’s Clubs? Company Boards often deteriorate to being a cosy club, friends of the boss, who just met to rubber stamp his decisions. I read the Economist (of 7th December) on flight, and the turn of phrase (on page 67) was interesting. Critics have compared directors to “parsley on fish”, decorative but ineffectual; or honorary colonels, ornamental in parade but fairly useless in battle”. Ralph Nader calls them “cuckolds” who are always the last to know when managers have erred.  The corporate scandals of the early 2000s forced boards to take a more active role. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the New York Stock Exchange’s New Rules in 2003 obliged directors to take more responsibility for preventing fraud and self-dealing. This led to a big increase in the quality of boards. But it also wasted a lot of talent on form-filling and box-ticking. Many of the same companies exhibited actual corporate governance risks such as conflicts of interest, inexperienced directors, overly lucrative compensation, or unequal share voting rights. In the face of such scandals and malpractices, there has been a renewed emphasis on corporate governance. OECD definition of corporate governance “Corporate governance is the system by which business corporations are directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure specifies the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation, such as, the board, managers, shareholders and other stakeholders and spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions in corporate affairs. By doing this, it also provides the structure through which the company objectives are set and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance” 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Thus corporate governance includes within its ambit, the relationship of a company to its shareholders and to society; the promotion of fairness, transparency and accountability; reference to mechanisms that are used to “govern” managers and to ensure that the actions taken by them are consistent with the interests of key stakeholder groups. The salient features span issues of transparency and accountability, the legal and regulatory environment, appropriate risk management measures, information flows, the responsibility of senior management and the board of directors. The Banking Regulation Act Section 10A of the Banking Regulation Act lays down stipulations for the Board of Directors. They must have special knowledge of the following  Accountancy   Agriculture and Rural Economy   Banking   Cooperation   Economics   Finance   Law   Small Scale Industry  Or any other matter, the special knowledge of, and practical experience in which, in the opinion of the Reserve Bank, would be useful to the Banking Company. Provided that out of the aforesaid number of Directors, not less than two shall have special knowledge of, practical experience, with respect to agriculture and the rural economy, cooperation or small scale industry and shall not (i) have substantial interest in, or be connected with, whether as an employee, manager or managing agent,   Any company, not being a company registered under section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 to 1956), or   Any firm, which carries on any trade, commerce or industry and which, in either case, is not a small scale industrial concern, or (ii) be proprietors of any trading, commercial or industrial concern, not being a small scale industrial concern.  Voting rights will be distributed amongst the Board of Directors in a manner such that no more than three Directors are entitled to exercise voting rights in excess of twenty percent of the total voting rights of all the shareholders to the Banking Entity. The tenure of Directors except the Chairman or the whole time director is limited to eight continuous years. The Chairman of the Board (appointed on a whole time basis) or the Managing Director of the Banking entity and any Director (appointed by the Reserve Bank under Section 10A of the Banking Regulation Act) will not be required to hold qualification shares in the Banking Entity. The RBI has the power, from time to time, to appoint one or more persons to hold office as additional directors of any Banking Company, if it is of the opinion that the same is in the interests of banking Policy/public interest/banking company depositors, it may also require the banking company to elect or appoint any other person as the Chairman in case it is of the opinion that the current elected Chairman is not a fit and proper person to hold such office. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Requirements of Corporate Governance as per the RBI guidelines on Corporate Governance RBI issues guidelines on corporate governance for public sector banks which serve as a base for the Corporate Governance framework in Banks.  Banks must perform due diligence of the directors in regard to their suitability for appointment to the Board by way of qualifications and technical expertise. The Government should also be guided by certain “fit and proper” norms for the appointment of Directors representing the Government on the Boards of Public sector banks. Banks need to elect shareholder nominees in proportion to the shares issued to public subject to a maximum of six nominees in respect of banks which have issued capital to public up to 40% of the Banks paid up capital. Executive Directors (EDs) are eligible for appointment as Chairman of the Board of Directors on fulfilment of the following criteria vesting in having served in the position and residual tenure. Guidelines on the number of EDs – Small Banks with business of less than INR 1.5 lakh crore may have two EDs with the responsibilities of the second Director including human resource development and technology. Large banks with business of more than Inr 3 lakh crore may have three EDs, the third with responsibility for HRD and Technology.  I have been a Director on the Board of Andhra Bank, I found that the Boards of Banks are hedged with innumerable Committees – there are Management Committee, Credit Approval Committee, Audit Committee, Risk management Committee, Special Committee to monitor large Value Frauds/Anti-Fraud Committee, Asset Liability Committee, Customer Service Committee, Shareholders Investors Grievance Committee, Share Transfer Committee, Remuneration Committee and so on and so forth and yet the state of Management and Corporate Governance in public sector banks remains a cause of grave concern.  As Deputy Governor, Dr. Chakrabarty, recently pointed out (Bancon address), if restructured assets show further deterioration surely the appraisal mechanisms were weak RAROC Risk adjusted Return on Capital was not correctly computed. The mechanisms of Corporate Governance surely merit much greater attention. Regulator as supervisor Banks constitute the largest financial intermediaries globally and possess stupendous powers of leverage. The RBI plays a direct role in Bank governance through the regulation and supervision of Banking Institutions. This role assumes greater salience viewed in conjunction with the need to ensure systemic and financial stability. Banks enjoy the benefit of high leverage with the downside protection of deposit insurance which weakens their incentives for strong management. They also remain “Too Big to Fail” (TBTF).  The current Basel accord lays even greater stress on risk measurement and management. Bank Supervisors must make the Boards of banks the main locus of accountability and assess board effectiveness. Regulatory and supervisory systems that foster more accurate information disclosure and empower private investors, legal rights, substantially boost banking system and profitability. Large investors may manipulate the firm contrary to the broad interests of Banks and other shareholders.  The task of the Bank supervisor is indeed onerous. Information asymmetries plague all sectors but this is even more tangential in finance; in product or other service markets, purchasers part with money in exchange for something new. In finance, money is exchanged for a promise to pay in the future. In many product or service markets, if the product sold – a car or a haircut is defective, the buyers often find out relatively soon. However, loan quality is not readily observable for quite some time and can be hidden for extensive periods. Banks can also alter the risk composition of their assets more quickly than most non-financial 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches industries. Banks can also sweep problems under the carpet by extending further loans to clients that cannot service previous debt obligations. In most sectors where there is an inventory pileup, be it cars or computers, it is generally a negative sign about the company’s performance but when inventories of money pile up in a bank, it becomes more liquid.  It is much harder to sort out whether this is a negative signal or a prudent response by management to a risky environment. Corporate governance of Banks is an essential element of sound regulatory architecture. The regulatory response is an imperative of ethics. Is the business of business just business? Milton Friedman had a view that corporate executive’s responsibility generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to their basic rules of the society, both, those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom. The objective is the maximisation of consumption and production. “The business of business is just business”. This is not an axiom one can concur with. If you consider the business of Companies historically, it has embraced colonialism and slavery! So the element of ethics must always underlie necessity of both business personal and organisational conduct. Formal codes of ethics While many of the governance issues that organizations face are not new, the environment in which they confront them today is more challenging than ever. Many companies are adopting legal compliance mechanisms which address ethics or conduct issues in formal documents. RBI ethics@work The RBI, with the assistance of Professor Dipankar Gupta, who is also a Director on the RBI Central Board, has formulated a Code of Conduct for itself, which we term ethics@work. You may well ask, why an ethics manual and I quote from the ethics manual  “An Ethics Manual promotes:  Solidarity among colleagues;   Pride and commitment to working for the Organization;   Personal Aspirations that are aligned with organizational goals.”  The ethics manual is expected   To define and clearly set out what will be deemed to be acceptable behaviour.   We hope that this will promote and ensure high standards of practice   And also establish a benchmark for self-evaluation   Lay down the mainframe for professional behaviour and responsibilities   Enable a sense of occupational identity Ideals we can clearly ascribe to.  The written code of ethics will be useful for socialization of our new recruits in the organization, serve as an implement of employee training. Be a benchmark transgression of the same, will invite disciplinary action. It will also help in dispute and conflict management. The moral dilemmas, the approach-approach conflicts will be more easily resolved with reference to the touchstone of the code of ethics. It clarifies the organisation’s expectations from the employee and vests on enshrining complete transparency. This is a formal code of business conduct and ethics, to be ascribed to and strictly adhered to by all employees. It is morally incumbent upon them to do so. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Some organisations also have ethics officers but in the ultimate analysis, the foundations of ethical behaviour go well beyond corporate culture and policies. These are rooted in one’s moral training, lessons parents and school teachers have taught from early childhood on which affect not just individual behaviour the competitive business environment and indeed society as a whole.  Conclusion From an ethical dimension, at a fundamental level, the key issues of corporate governance involve questions concerning relationships and building trust (both within and outside the organization. Aristotle, in the Nichomacnean Ethics explained that it is “in justice” that the ordering of society is centered. Ethics comes from the Greek ethos and embraces both work ethics and “mores” – the conduct and culture of the organisation. It is therefore all encompassing and must be all pervasive.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Andreas Dombret: Current developments in Europe Introductory remarks by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the German Embassy, Paris, 11 December 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen Let me kick off the discussion by offering some thoughts on the current state of play in Europe, and the euro area in particular. Many challenges have by now been overcome, yet some still remain ahead. Let me mention a few of them. First, the markets are still concerned about the quality of banks’ balance sheets and possible forbearance policies. The lack of transparency about true asset quality is certainly an issue. Price-to-book ratios of less than one testify to this. Second, it is true that we have seen significant improvements in market access and funding costs during recent months. However, signs of fragmentation between the so-called periphery and other countries of the euro area are still evident. That is, financing conditions for sovereigns, banks and corporates continue to diverge along national borders. Third, in many parts of Europe the necessary deleveraging process still has to continue. The corporate and private household sectors in some European economies are still riddled with debt from previous exuberance. Likewise, public deficits and sovereign debt levels are uncomfortably high in many countries. Finally, growth, when measured on an annual basis, in the euro area remains subdued. The European Commission expects euro area real GDP to shrink by 0.4% in 2013. And in 2014, growth may well amount to a mere 1.1%. This adds to the challenges facing bank balance sheets and public finances. So, is it all gloom and doom? Far from it, I would argue, as long as policy makers take the right steps. Let us take a short look at what has been done so far and what remains to be done. Let me begin with the issue of monetary policy, as you would probably expect from a central banker. Only few would dispute that the measures taken by the Eurosystem have greatly reduced tail risks in the financial markets. However, I cannot conceal the concern that these measures come with diminishing rates of return. In fact, we may soon reach a point where their risks outweigh their benefits. In the end, monetary policy cannot solve the crisis. Everyone agrees on this. All monetary policy can do is to buy time. And in doing so the Eurosystem has entered unchartered and dangerous territory. Thus, policy makers should make good use of the time that monetary policy is buying. And indeed, Europe is proceeding with a comprehensive reform agenda to tackle the root causes of the remaining challenges. One of these challenges is the close link between banks and sovereigns. Breaking this link is important for making the euro area more stable. To achieve this objective, we have to adjust the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures over the medium term. Two steps are important: first, an upper limit for banks’ exposure to individual sovereigns should be introduced. Second, banks’ investments in sovereign bonds should be backed with capital. But there is more to do. A banking union can represent another major step to break the link between banks and sovereigns. Centralising supervisory powers over large banks can foster 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches a comprehensive view and unbiased policy action that is not held hostage by national interests. A first step in this direction will be the Balance Sheet Assessment under the auspices of the ECB. It is important to conduct this exercise in an impartial and unprejudiced manner. The German banking industry has already spent considerable efforts on cleaning its balance sheets – some as part of the Commission’s state aid decisions, some in reaction to EBA stress tests, some for other reason. Thus, banks are in a better condition now than they were a few years ago. I am not afraid of huge surprises. But for all banks subject to the assessment it cannot be excluded that problems still remain. We need to uncover and address these problems now, before the single supervisory mechanism is launched. Meanwhile, a comprehensive banking union has to comprise more than just an effective single supervisory mechanism. It needs to be complemented by a single resolution mechanism. This is a necessary step to solve the too-big-to-fail-problem. Large banks must be able to fail without endangering the stability of the whole system. Otherwise, the government would have to step in to prevent a systemic crisis. This would create an asymmetry: Heads, banks win, tails, taxpayers lose. Against this backdrop, establishing a clear hierarchy and minimizing discretion in the handling of bank creditor bail-ins is indispensable to win back lost trust. Based on the EU finance ministers’ agreement of June 2013, the Recovery and Resolution Directive is now close to being adopted. It might ultimately turn out to be a net positive, as it provides clear orientation for markets. Moreover, it might even have positive effects for banks’ financing conditions. There is no doubt that the banking union is a major step forward in designing a better framework for monetary union. However, we also need structural reforms at the national level which are key to restore competitiveness and sound public finances. It is certainly true that reaping the fruit of success comes with a time lag. But experience from Germany – which ten years ago was nicknamed the “sick man” of Europe – shows that the benefits will come to the fore sooner or later. And lately, growth data from the euro area have been indicating that a silver lining is appearing on the horizon, Macroeconomic rebalancing in the euro area is underway. Importantly, the euro area left recession, with 0.1% growth in the third quarter. In, Italy and Greece contraction slowed down, while Spain joined Portugal and Ireland in leaving the recession behind. At the same time, exports are increasing. All the crisis countries – except Cyprus – are projected to see some export growth this year, ranging from just 1/2% in Ireland to almost 6% in Portugal. These achievements are reflected in current accounts reverting more and more to positive balances. Competitiveness has also improved in most peripheral countries. Since 2009 Greece has seen its unit labour costs diminish by over 8%, in Ireland, Spain and Portugal unit labour costs declined by 11%, 7% and 6% respectively. The structural reforms implemented are a key explanation for these successes. Thus, at the center of the crisis, the situation is improving. But what about the two largest economies in the euro area; what about France and Germany? Looking at France, we see good potential: the country is home to many renowned firms, it has a strong domestic market, and it has favourable demographics – in particular when compared to Germany. However, it also faces structural challenges. The unemployment rate stands at more than 10% and France’s world market share of exports has declined significantly over the past 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 10 years. And despite the consolidation efforts of the past years, public debt stands at more than 90% of GDP – a level that could become a significant burden on economic growth. Additionally, France has acknowledged the importance of a competitive economy. The government has embarked on a number of reforms to increase the competitiveness of the economy. Furthermore, the social partners agreed on labour market reforms which could be an important step toward achieving a better functioning labour market. Looking at Germany, the current situation seems to be quite pleasing: Germany’s economy is in infinitely better shape than just ten years ago. Nevertheless, I do believe that we need a more level-headed assessment – Germany, too, faces structural challenges. There are four important areas we have to address: First, Germany has to cope with unfavourable demographics, which will be increasingly felt in the coming years. Second, due to globalisation firms are going to face increasing pressure from emerging market competitors. Third, fiscal policy will have to bring down high public debt. And fourth, Germany is trying to completely change its energy policies. This change will have a profound impact on the competitiveness of industry and the purchasing power of households. Thus, focusing on those countries in the center of the crisis might distract us from the fact that all countries in Europe face structural challenges – including France and Germany. At the end of the day, Europe can only work if all of us move in the same direction. Only together can France and Germany act as the driving forces of European integration. And only together can France and Germany help to solve the current crisis. The positive developments I highlighted in my speech show the payoffs of staying on the path of reform. And they give us the necessary backing to do what most Europeans know needs to be done: use the window of opportunity of relative market calm. Use it to further push forward reforms, both, at the national and at the European level. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Mario Draghi: Interview in Le Journal du Dimanche Interview with Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, in Le Journal du Dimanche, published on 15 December 2013. *      *      * Is Europe finally returning to growth? Growth has returned, but it is certainly not very strong. It is modest, fragile and unequal. Germany is doing well; France, Italy and Spain are improving; things are not going so well in the Netherlands; and Greece and Portugal remain under pressure. Unemployment is still too high, but it seems to have stabilised at an average of around 12%. We forecast that growth in the euro area will be 1.1% next year and 1.5% in 2015. What is driving the recovery? Looking at the figures, we can see that exports are picking up again and – this is a new development – consumption is recovering. Various factors have played a role in that. First of all, our monetary policy, which has remained accommodative since 2011, is in the process of bearing fruit. The commitments that we have made regarding the future direction of our monetary policy and our decision in November to reduce the rate on our main refinancing operations to 0.25%, the second reduction in 2013, have also contributed to that. Uncertainty is receding, which should help to stimulate investment and encourage banks to lend. Purchasing power has also improved as a result of declines in energy and food prices.  Do you think that a line needs to be drawn under Greek debt in order for the country to get out of its current situation? The reform programme put in place with the aid of the IMF and the Commission in liaison with the ECB seems to be bearing fruit. We will examine Greece’s budgetary situation and its development at the start of the year. The Greek people have already made a large number of sacrifices and I hope that the country will achieve budget surpluses (excluding its debt burden) as of next year. Nevertheless, the reforms have to continue. Do you believe that the bitter pill of austerity that was imposed on the countries of the euro area in order to tackle the debt crisis was the right solution, the only acceptable response? Austerity was essential, as it was the necessary solution to one of the most serious financial crises that we have ever seen. Prior to 2010, the world we were living in was somewhat unreal. Our creditors, institutional investors, were not differentiating between credit to Greece and credit to Germany. When people began having doubts regarding Greece’s solvency, all of that came to an end. Institutional investors began re-evaluating the risk profiles of all the countries of the EU. We know what happened next: spreads on lending rates began to increase, distinguishing between countries that were judged to be safe (and therefore creditworthy) and the rest. This crisis has taught us a lesson. It has taught us that we cannot generate either sustainable growth or a fair distribution of prosperity by amassing debt. It has also forced us to focus on the fundamentals in order to check the solidity of each individual economy. That was when we realised that the time for structural reforms had come. Without the crisis, we could have given ourselves more time to implement them, and we could have accompanied the austerity plans with stimulus measures. But as that was not done when we had time, reforms have had to be implemented as a matter of urgency and in a painful manner. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Pierre Moscovici, our Minister for the Economy, believes that France is the victim of “French bashing”, as it has reduced its deficit and undertaken fundamental reforms. What do you think? Major efforts have been made, but it is important that France continues along the path of the reforms already undertaken. The government and the French people are aware of this. Competitiveness remains insufficient, and improvements to public finances must stop being based on tax rises. France needs to return to fiscal stability so that firms start to invest again. Should Germany, the true engine of European growth, not share the fruits of its growth with its neighbours in order to foster a broad-based recovery? The real issue here is slightly different. We need to try to understand why Germany is doing better than its neighbours. The answer is that Germany has given itself the means to be more competitive thanks to its bold structural reforms. In the early 2000s, Germany launched labour market reforms. It remains an example for the other EU countries to follow. Its performance is based on the great strength of its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are exporting and innovating. That platform needs to be preserved. But Germany should not rest on its laurels and needs to foster investment, particularly investment in infrastructure. What are the prospects for Europe, given that growth is no longer creating jobs? Unemployment is indeed the number one problem for the governments of EU countries – starting with youth employment. We are too inclined to think that industry remains the key driver of employment, when in reality it is services that create the most jobs. That is partly because services have been less exposed to competition than the industrial sector.  Banks are being criticised for ceasing to finance the economy. What are you doing to encourage them? Two years ago we provided them with €1,000 billion in the form of three-year loans, some of which has already been repaid, and since then we have reduced our key interest rates several times. Banks are able to refinance their loans to firms using funds obtained from the ECB. That has given them breathing space. Some of them have been given assistance, and they have been able to increase their capital.  We now have to convince them to take the kinds of risk that are beneficial to the economy, notably by lending to SMEs. It should also be noted that demand for credit has declined. Some firms, having experienced falling sales and a lack of visibility regarding the future, are hesitant about investing, while large firms are increasingly turning to the markets, financing themselves by issuing bonds. Last year, bond issuance by such firms totalled €34 billion, offsetting a contraction in loans of around €20 billion. Will the banking supervision work that the ECB has been tasked with reveal the presence of a Lehman Brothers among Europe’s banking groups? It is difficult to say at this stage. Countries such as Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, which have been given financial assistance, have already taken steps to consolidate their banking networks. In addition, regulators have asked their banks to make provision for non-performing loans and to increase their capital in order to ensure their solvency. But yes – we need to ascertain the precise situation, and in 2014 that will be the priority of the new European banking supervision mechanism, which will be headed by Danièle Nouÿ. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Has the ECB done all it can to stimulate growth? In the context of our mandate, yes. And we are always ready and able to act at a later stage. We have already deployed some of our instruments in the context of our accommodative monetary policy, despite the fact that certain people accused us of taking enormous risks and endangering price stability. We have seen nothing of the sort. On the contrary, our actions have had the desired effect. We remain just as determined today to ensure price stability and safeguard the integrity of the euro. But the ECB cannot do it all alone. We will not do governments’ work for them. It is up to them to undertake fundamental reforms, support innovation and manage public spending – in short, to come up with new models for growth.  Is the ECB not a prisoner of German budgetary orthodoxy in terms of the interpretation of its mandate? The ECB acts under the Treaties, which have been ratified by all European countries. The Treaties require each country to ensure the sustainability of its public finances. And this is a question of common sense. Look at what happened when the credibility of certain countries’ public finances deteriorated to the point where their access to the market was compromised. They had to undergo the painful adjustment programmes that you have just been referring to. It is the unsustainable debt and deficit levels that render countries prisoners of the markets. Some people would like to see the ECB fight to combat unemployment, like the Federal Reserve. Why do you refuse to do that? Our main task is to maintain price stability. Of course, insofar as our actions stabilise the economy, they help to reduce unemployment. However, we cannot reduce the structural level of unemployment, which is dependent on the smooth functioning of the labour market and its ability to better integrate those who have been excluded from it. Taking the example of German growth, that has not come from the reduction of our interest rates (although that will have helped), but rather from the reforms of previous years.  The euro has strengthened considerably against the US dollar. What are you doing to counter that and make the euro more competitive? I have no desire to speculate regarding the right euro/US dollar exchange rate. We have no objectives in terms of exchange rates. However, I recognise that a high exchange rate has consequences for growth and inflation in Europe.  Which is to be feared more: deflation or a return to inflation? Neither one nor the other. We are not experiencing deflation. Prices are not falling in a sufficiently strong or generalised manner to entail the postponement of purchases and investment, and thus the kind of economic slowdown that we saw in Japan. Inflation is at a low level, well below the 2% threshold, and should remain weak until 2015. That was why we decided to reduce our key interest rates, in order to have a buffer to curb the decline. What answer do you have for the growing number of Europeans who no longer want the euro? I would tell them that the euro is the basis for our future. The euro is a sound currency, and one that is entirely fulfilling its role, but it is suffering from the fact that our monetary union is incomplete and imperfect. We need to complete our monetary union if we want to truly achieve lasting stability and prosperity in Europe. First of all, we need to move forward with the banking union and complete the reform and deficit reduction programmes that we have embarked on. The populist argument that, by leaving the euro, a national economy will 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches instantly benefit from a competitive devaluation, as it did in the good old days, does not hold water. If everybody tries to devalue their currency, nobody benefits. Ultimately, the road to prosperity always goes via reforms and the search for productivity and innovation. Do you dread an anti-European vote in the elections in May? I am expecting a stronger anti-European presence in the European Parliament relative to today. We have to be conscious of that and respond to the distrust that has become entrenched in public opinion when it comes to the European project and its institutions. There is no doubt that populist movements are capitalising on that sentiment, but there are also people who are genuinely disappointed. It is up to us to explain why the euro has been and remains a mark of progress, a currency for the future. It is up to us to point out that European integration has proved to be the best way of safeguarding peace. However, we also need to give our community a renewed sense of purpose – to explain that more Europe and greater integration can contribute to progress, economic recovery and prosperity. We have to give people fresh hope. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardo Hansson: Nordic-Baltic financial linkages and challenges Opening remarks by Mr Ardo Hansson, Governor of the Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank), at the conference “Nordic-Baltic financial linkages and challenges”, Tallinn, 13 December 2013. *      *      * I am honored to welcome you here in Tallinn at the conference Nordic-Baltic Financial Linkages and Challenges jointly organized by the IMF, Riksbank and Eesti Pank. Jean Monnet once famously said that Europe will be the sum of the decisions taken in crises. We hope to have soon put one of these crises behind us. We now know that inadequate assessment of risks and weaknesses in the regulatory and supervisory framework were among the causes of the crisis. We hope that the lessons learned from the crisis will be profound and lasting enough to provide the energy for us to follow through with the fundamental reforms we have initiated in the EU. We also now understand the need to remain vigilant and ready to act against possible new risks to financial stability. Today’s conference will take a close look at the challenges and rewards involved in the evolution of a new paradigm in the operation and regulation of the European financial sector. The financial sector in the Nordic-Baltic region is regularly used as an example of regional integration and cooperation. In my remarks, I would like to highlight the key features of the region and put them in the broader context of European developments. Taking care of the large Nordic-Baltic “home market” First of all, we should keep in mind that the Nordic-Baltic region is characterized by considerable diversity: diversity in monetary policy frameworks, models of economic development and financial structures. The second key word of the Nordic-Baltic region is integration – the region is characterized by tight trade and financial ties within the region as well as with Europe and global markets. Therefore, the region’s competitiveness and growth potential are important to each country in the region. The bank groups that finance growth in the region are largely the same in every country. All these groups are currently highly rated and well capitalized in comparison to others in Europe. As a result of mergers and natural growth, the total assets of the larger banks have risen to a high level compared to regional GDP, not to mention their very high level as a ratio to the GDP of their home countries. The combination of common economic interests and financial sector integration has fostered the emergence of a unique feature of the Nordic banking groups: they have extended the concept of the “home market” well beyond their home country’s borders. For example, Nordic parent banks continued to provide liquidity to their Baltic affiliates even during the years of the deepest crisis in the Baltic economies. In today’s slow growth environment, it remains important for competitiveness and growth that there should be an appropriate level of financing in the whole region. The broader concept of the “home market” should be developed further. One of the challenges will be to ensure strong competition in retail markets so that the benefits of integration could be felt by consumers across the region. Fostering sustainable growth in the region requires us to take a systemic view when designing harmonized regulation for the financial sector, and this is where the quality and proactivity of macro-prudential supervision becomes so important. The Nordic-Baltic dimension adds two nuances to the design of macro-prudential policies. First, our own experience of the past decade was a stark reminder of the particular challenges of managing capital flows in highly integrated economies and financial sectors. Second, most of the large Nordic banking groups have been considered as too big to fail in almost all countries in the region. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Diversity in the financial sector structures is a challenge for cross-border cooperation As I said earlier, the economies and financial sectors of the Nordic-Baltic region are diverse as well as closely integrated. Different countries in the region have opted for different policy frameworks; the structure of the financial sector also differs by country. It turns out that in a region of only eight countries, some of which are very small, one needs to tackle very much the same array of problems that make the coordination of financial sector policy and supervision so challenging in Europe. There are home and host countries; there are non-EU member states, EU member states, and euro area member states. There are differences in economic, lending and asset price cycles, and there are also differences in economic history, crisis experience and institutional arrangements. The developments in recent years have exacerbated these dissimilarities and perhaps even created new ones. It appears to me that the success in combining the positive aspects of diversity and integration in the Nordic-Baltic region may serve as a model for the European Union. If cooperation and coordination has been possible in this region, there is reason to hope for the same in the European Union as a whole. Cooperation between the institutions responsible for financial stability in the region has a history of over 10 years. This cooperation has become considerably closer since the outbreak of the global financial crisis and the reversal of capital flows in our countries. Routine work is done in supervisory colleges, and there are high-level multilateral groups for coordinating macro-prudential supervision and crisis management. It has been very important that trust and open communication as well as mutual support and a willingness to take responsibility have remained in place when the financial stability of a Nordic-Baltic country is really at stake. A shared understanding of the need to deal with macroeconomic and financial stability risks at a national level has provided a solid foundation for Nordic-Baltic cooperation. 2014 will bring new challenges for Europe The year 2014 will bring new challenges. New financial sector regulation (I am referring to the CRR/CRD and the forthcoming BRRD) and single banking supervision will add new aspects and new partners to Nordic-Baltic cooperation. The goal of harmonisation of cross-border regulatory and supervisory practices is to create an operating environment for banks and other financial institutions that fosters mutual trust and helps ensure that the provision of financial services is continuous and satisfies the needs of the real economy. When the SSM becomes operational, it will have important effects on the routine supervisory work in the Nordic-Baltic region. The home countries of several subsidiaries that will be included under direct supervision by the SSM/ECB will probably remain outside the SSM. This presents a new challenge for the Nordic-Baltic cooperation framework. In the light of the success of our regional cooperation it is rational that we build the new principles of supervision on the existing foundation wherever possible. I hope and believe that in this new and more complex framework we will be able to preserve an important value – the spirit of cooperation. In view of the development of the single market it is also important that the building of the banking union be completed – the SSM must be followed by the SRM. Ideally, this would create the balance between rights and responsibilities which has been the guiding principle in safeguarding cross-border financial stability for nearly a decade. There is no doubt that the special features of the Nordic-Baltic region complicate agreements on joint crisis management, and the design of cooperation in this matter will be crucial. *** Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great honour and privilege to host this conference on issues which are highly topical not just in our region but also in Europe and globally. The conference has brought together 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  prominent speakers and an audience who have great potential to provide different viewpoints in the discussions. In the light of today’s topic, let us also consider the values that have made the Nordic-Baltic region so successful. Let us consider how to preserve and build upon these values and possibly share them with the rest of Europe. And finally, let us not exaggerate the difficulties of cooperation; let us not underestimate the rewards of success or the risks that stem from inaction. Building the foundation for the future of Nordic-Baltic finance is not for the fainthearted.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Fritz Zurbrügg: Financial markets, the management of Swiss currency reserves and interest rate benchmark reforms Introductory remarks by Mr Fritz Zurbrügg, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 12 December 2013. *      *      * I will begin today by looking at the situation on the financial markets. Then I will talk briefly about developments in our foreign exchange holdings. I will close with a few comments on the progress that has been made in reforming interest rate benchmarks at both international and national level. Situation on financial markets Since our last media news conference in June, the positive risk sentiment on financial markets has been largely maintained, as is evident from the soaring share prices, among other things. In the past few weeks, the key US indices Dow Jones and S&P 500 have reached new record levels, thereby exceeding the peaks attained prior to the global financial crisis. In addition, Japan’s Nikkei Index and the most important western European stock exchange indices, including the Swiss SMI, have again recorded significant gains in recent months. Despite all the euphoria on the stock exchanges, we must not forget that it is not only the improvement in the economic outlook but also the continuation of the very expansionary monetary policy around the world which is behind this positive risk sentiment. In May and June we saw what could happen if expectations of a less expansionary monetary policy course become widespread in the market. At that time, the announcement by the US Federal Reserve of a possible reduction in its bond purchase programme caused share markets to plunge temporarily. The wave of selling did not recede until the beginning of July, when the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England reassured markets that key rates would remain at very low levels until the recovery of the individual economies was on a firm foundation. On bond markets, interest rates continued rising in June and July. Since then, they have largely moved sideways. This applies to US, UK, German and Swiss government bonds, in particular. Until the beginning of September, yields on ten-year Confederation bonds rose to almost 1.2%. They are currently at around 1%, which means that they have increased by about half a percent year-on-year. Government bonds in the emerging economies were particularly strongly affected by the rise in interest rates, since the expectation of an impending monetary policy normalisation in the US led to significant capital outflows from these countries. By contrast, risk premia on government bonds for the peripheral euro area economies did not increase very much. Moreover, these risk premia have fallen again in the meantime so that returns on government bonds in the peripheral economies are now in fact lower than at the beginning of the year. This is probably due, not least, to progress in overcoming the crisis as well as encouraging economic data from the euro area. However, investors are still cautious, so that demand is still high for investments seen as safe havens. Consequently, in recent months, the Swiss franc has moved in a narrow range above the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20. Nevertheless, in view of the progress in the euro area, many market participants expect that the Swiss franc will depreciate. Despite this progress, it is still too early for an all-clear. Conditions on financial markets could change again rapidly. In order to counteract possible tensions on financial markets and lessen their potential impact on the economy, six leading central banks including the Swiss 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  National Bank (SNB) converted their reciprocal swap lines into a standing arrangement in October. These swap lines had initially been arranged on a temporary basis at the height of the financial crisis, in order to secure access to liquidity. Developments in foreign exchange reserves At the end of September 2013, our holdings of foreign exchange reserves stood at CHF 443 billion. I would now like to make a few comments on income from foreign exchange reserves. I should begin by stressing that monetary policy has priority over investment policy, and that generating income is not the primary objective of investment policy. We are guided, first of all, by the criteria of security and liquidity. The criterion of security covers primarily the reduction of risks such as market, credit and concentration risks. In addition, it is important for us to maintain the real value of the foreign exchange reserves in the long term. Consequently, the long-term return on investment must match the average rate of inflation. If the criteria of security and liquidity are fulfilled, our investment policy aims to achieve an additional return over and above the real maintenance of value. The return on foreign exchange reserves is made up of current income plus changes in the value of the investments. The income takes the form of interest and dividend payments on the bonds and shareholdings. In view of the current low interest rate environment, these amount to only around 2% of foreign exchange reserves per year. Just like investments that fall due, income is generally reinvested. Therefore, foreign exchange reserves tend to rise even when we do not need to purchase additional foreign exchange. The other component of returns is changes in the value of foreign exchange reserves. We value all investments at market prices and in Swiss francs. Consequently, changes in the prices of interest-bearing paper and shares as well as exchange rate movements have a direct impact on the net result for investment. If the Swiss franc strengthens against the investment currencies, this results in a valuation loss on the foreign exchange reserves. The chart shows the net investment result since the first quarter of 2010 for the foreign exchange reserves, as well as for the individual components. The dominant role of exchange rate movements is clearly evident. In the past, too, exchange rate movements have posed by far the greatest risk to our portfolio. Taking a long-term view, exchange rates have been responsible for about 80% of the total risk on the foreign currency reserves. Reform of interest rate benchmarks Following last year’s revelations that Libor interest rates had been manipulated, various activities to reform the Libor and other interest rate benchmarks are under way. The SNB is involved in these reform activities at both international and national level. The objective is to improve the credibility and acceptance of the existing interest rate benchmarks or, where appropriate, to take steps to ensure the provision of robust alternative interest rate benchmarks. International efforts are being coordinated by the Financial Stability Board on behalf of the G20 countries. They involve not only central banks and supervisory authorities but also an international group of private sector financial market participants. They are examining, first, the extent to which the existing Libor interest rates fulfil the requirements laid down by securities supervisors last July (the IOSCO standards). Second, they are investigating whether there are alternative interest rate benchmarks which would better meet the needs of the market and the requirements of supervisory authorities in the longer term. Alternatives to the Libor are being developed by the private sector group, which also includes Swiss representatives. The Financial Stability Board plans to present the results of its work in the middle of next year. At the international level, activities are also under way to regulate the interest rate benchmarks as well as other important reference variables on the financial markets. In 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  London, the Libor is already now subject to a supervisory regime. In Brussels, a bill has been proposed which would regulate all interest rate benchmarks used in the EU. In Switzerland, too, a need for regulatory action is likely to emerge in this area. At the national level, the SNB and FINMA are talking to financial market participants about ensuring a more robust construction of the interest rate benchmarks which are fixed in Switzerland. The aim is to widen the data pool and improve the calculation methods, and the focus is on reference interest rates for very short-term Swiss franc transactions, specifically one-day terms. These transactions form the basis for the Swiss franc yield curve. The two benchmarks involved are, first, the TOIS fixing, which is used for interest rate derivatives in the Swiss franc money market, and second, SARON, which serves as the basis for the yield curve on the Swiss franc repo market. Progress has already been achieved on both interest rate benchmarks. Although the level of activity on the money market remains persistently low, they continue to be available to the market as a basis for interest rate transactions in Swiss francs. However, the Libor retains its position as the most important interest rate benchmark in the money and capital markets.     
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Coeuré: Interview in Die Zeit Interview with Mr Benoît Coeuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in Die Zeit, conducted by Mr Mark Schieritz and published on 9 December 2013. *      *      * Mr Cœuré, do you know what the interest rate on savings accounts in Germany is? Very low, probably close to 0%. That’s correct. Some banks pay 0.25% or even less. Can you relate to savers in Germany being annoyed that the European Central Bank (ECB) is making them foot the bill for the crisis? Rates are very low because the euro area economy is weak. Take the example of low long-term interest rates on German government bonds, which are important for life insurance contracts and pensions. Why exactly is the weak economy responsible for low rates? If growth is weak, there are few profitable investment opportunities. As savings need to be invested in order to achieve returns, this means that returns are low. Low market rates also, however, create the conditions for new growth and this will also boost future returns on savings. So you are saying that German savers benefit from the ECB’s low rates? My message is: it is important to differentiate between long-term rates for savers and the policy rate of the ECB. Long-term rates are low because the economy is weak. In such circumstances, the ECB has to set its policy rate in such a way as to ensure price stability. Thereby we support the economy and create the conditions for profitable investment opportunities – and this is also of benefit to German savers. So what would you say to Germans who are worried about their retirement provision? I would tell them that the best way to improve the return on their savings is for the crisis to be solved as quickly as possible. This means that the economic reforms have to be implemented in the stressed countries, but it also means that we have to complete the measures designed to make the euro area as a whole safer. We need, above all, a functioning banking union so that German government bonds are not the only safe haven assets in the euro area anymore. If Germany still had the Deutsche Mark, interest rates would be higher. I don’t want to speculate on hypothetical issues. Our currency is the euro. But look at Switzerland: the country has its own currency and interest rates are extremely low nevertheless, namely because investors consider it a safe haven like Germany. You mentioned price stability. Inflation is currently very low. Where’s the harm in that? It is, above all, a question of confidence. The ECB is committed to maintaining price stability, by which we mean keeping inflation below, but close to, 2% – and we have achieved this objective. Average inflation since the introduction of the euro is 2.03%. This has contributed to economic stability in Europe. If we were to miss our objective, people would start to question our commitment. That also holds if we were to tolerate inflation rates that were too low. We cannot risk such a loss of confidence. The main reason for the current low level of inflation is price and cost adjustment in the crisis countries, thereby enabling these countries to become more competitive. It is good that the economies needing to regain competitiveness adjust. But the adjustment is much easier if inflation in the euro area as a whole stands at 2%, rather than, say, 1%. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Why? We know from experience that, at least in Europe, it is very difficult to cut nominal wages. If prices are rising, you get the desired effect – the cost of labour declines in real terms – just by holding nominal wages constant. This is why there is no major central bank in the world that seeks to eliminate inflation completely. Inflation should be at a low, but positive level. The inflation rate in the euro area is currently at 0.9%. If we take you at your word, the ECB is in fact not doing its job. It is true that, as a result of the weak economy, there is little scope for prices to increase. But we expect the rate of inflation to come back to 2% over the medium term. According to your staff projections, inflation will be below the target until 2015. What do you mean by medium term? We are not giving a more precise time frame, but we are certainly not talking about a decade or a generation. If the countries in the south have lower inflation rates and the ECB wants to keep overall inflation at 2%, then that means logically that Germany has to accept higher inflation. It is not a goal of our policy to artificially increase inflation in Germany. But if the German economy keeps doing well, and wages increase, inflation will naturally also increase somewhat. That is a result of market decisions. What is important for us is that average inflation in the euro area as a whole returns to our objective. And what if it does not? We cut interest rates last month because we came to the conclusion that inflation would stay below target for too long. Looking ahead, if we come to the conclusion that this remains the case, we would have to act again. This is not our scenario at this stage, however. We are confident that inflation will gradually come back to 2%, mainly because the euro area economy will come out of recession. But of course we have to monitor the situation very carefully. I do not want to rule out further steps. Interest rates are already close to zero. What could you do? There are a number of things we could do. We could cut interest rates again, by, say, moving the deposit rate into negative territory, and we could provide additional liquidity to the banking sector. Which of these options – if any – we will use depends on the economic developments. We could also combine these measures. As for the crisis in Europe, would you say that the worst is over? I would say that the worst of the financial crisis in a narrow sense is over. The main task of European authorities this year and last year was to stabilise financial markets. This has been largely successful: markets are much calmer and have more confidence in European recovery now. The main task next year will be to get the economy going. Some people in Germany say that France, your home country, is the biggest risk for the Monetary Union. I would certainly not call France a risk in terms of financial stability. The French financial and banking system is resilient. There is currently no danger whatsoever that the country may lose access to financial markets. The problem is that growth could remain weak if reforms are not taken forward. Companies have to increase their competitiveness and the government has to get the budget under control by cutting public spending.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Thomas Jordan: Global economic outlook and economic developments in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 12 December 2013. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen Welcome to the Swiss National Bank’s news conference. I would like to begin today by explaining the SNB’s monetary policy decision before moving on to present our assessment of the economic situation and monetary conditions. My colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will then talk to you about developments in connection with financial stability and banknotes. Finally, my colleague, Fritz Zurbrügg, will look at the current situation on the financial markets, as well as at the management of our currency reserves and interest rate benchmark reforms. As always, we will conclude with a question and answer session. I will now start with our monetary policy decision. As you will have no doubt expected, the SNB is maintaining its minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. The Swiss franc is still high. With the three-month Libor already practically at zero, the minimum exchange rate continues to be the right tool for ensuring appropriate monetary conditions in Switzerland. If the Swiss franc were to appreciate, this would have significant consequences for the Swiss economy. On the one hand, an appreciation would lead to a further decline in import prices and a renewed threat of deflation. In this regard, we should bear in mind that inflation in the last two years has been predominantly negative. On the other hand, with an ongoing unfavourable international environment and a strong Swiss franc, the situation for our economy remains challenging. Should it become necessary, we will therefore enforce the minimum exchange rate by buying foreign currency in unlimited quantities. And, if required, we will also take further measures. In addition, we are leaving the target range for the three-month Libor at 0.0–0.25%. The SNB bases its monetary policy decision on a conditional inflation forecast, which assumes an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.0% over the next three years. You will find the relevant chart in your media kit. Compared to September, our forecast has been adjusted downwards slightly. Reasons for this are the unexpectedly low rates of inflation for October and November, which serve as a lower departure point for the forecast, as well as the decline in inflation in the euro area and the slight fall in the oil price, which both help to dampen the inflation outlook. For 2013, we still anticipate inflation of –0.2%. For 2014 and 2015, the inflation forecast is down in each case by 0.1 percentage points and is now at 0.2% and 0.6% respectively. Consequently, no inflation risks can be identified for Switzerland in the foreseeable future. Global economic outlook The SNB’s inflation forecast is embedded in a global economic scenario. I would therefore like to begin with our assessment of the global economy. Global economic recovery continued as expected in recent months, with the main drivers being the US, the UK and China. In the euro area, by contrast, growth lacked momentum and inflation slowed considerably more than expected. In many emerging economies, too, economic activity was rather sluggish. The outlook for the global economy has not changed significantly since the September monetary policy assessment. Our forecasts suggest that growth will pick up gradually in the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  coming quarters. Further recovery is likely to be underpinned by a number of factors, including stable international financial markets, a less restrictive fiscal policy and a very expansionary monetary policy in the major advanced economies. Europe, however, will continue to experience below-average growth, with banks’ restrained lending policies and ongoing uncertainty hampering investment activity. In addition, the high level of unemployment in this region will also hold back private consumption. Uncertainty about the continued recovery of the global economy remains high overall. In many advanced economies, room for manoeuvre in economic policy is being constrained by the fact that interest rates are already very low and government indebtedness is high, making the global economy especially prone to shocks. We expect that the euro area will overcome the crisis in the medium term. However, the forthcoming assessment of banks’ balance sheets could cause some ripples. Furthermore, exiting from unconventional monetary policy measures is as yet uncharted territory. Spikes on international financial markets therefore cannot be ruled out during the process of normalising monetary policy in the major currency areas. Swiss economic outlook I will now look at economic developments in Switzerland. The economy continued to develop favourably in the third quarter. Annualised real GDP was up by slightly more than 2%. Unlike the previous quarter, goods exports grew substantially. Domestic demand, however, lost some momentum. On the output side, manufacturing in particular recorded positive growth, having previously fallen for three successive quarters. Construction continues to be an important growth driver. Owing to this positive growth, utilisation of production capacity picked up. Nevertheless, it remained at a relatively low level in manufacturing. Employment increased slightly and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has not risen further since summer. Overall, the output gap remains negative. The indicators already available suggest that growth will weaken temporarily in the fourth quarter. Following the sharp increase in the third quarter, goods exports and industrial output, in particular, are likely to advance at a slower pace. In the coming year, with the gradual improvement in the global economy, GDP should once again grow more strongly. We continue to expect growth of 1.5–2.0% for 2013. For 2014, we expect a growth rate of around 2.0%. However, given the vulnerable economic situation abroad, downside risks still prevail for Switzerland. Monetary and financial conditions I will now turn to monetary and financial conditions. Last summer, sparked by the debate about a possible reduction in the US Federal Reserve’s bond purchase programme, long-term interest rates rose across the globe. Switzerland was no exception. The most recent interest rate reduction by the European Central Bank (ECB), by contrast, had little effect on Switzerland. One possible reason for this is that money market rates in the euro area were already at a very low level before the ECB’s decision and did not fall any further. Since October 2011, inflation rates in Switzerland have been predominantly negative. The introduction of the minimum exchange rate in September 2011 prevented a more severe deflationary trend, however. Lower price levels in Switzerland reflect, on the one hand, the impact of the past appreciation of the Swiss franc on import goods prices. On the other hand, price developments show clearly that domestic companies are lowering their costs so as to improve their price competitiveness. More than two years after the introduction of the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  minimum exchange rate, both effects have weakened considerably; this is also reflected in the current path of inflation. At the same time, inflation abroad is receding, especially in the euro area. The inflation differential between Switzerland and the euro area has thus decreased significantly. Inflation differentials play an important role in the valuation of the Swiss franc. This decreased inflation differential means that the real effective exchange rate will hardly change from now on and will remain considerably above its long-term average. Unless there is a substantial nominal depreciation, the current high value of the Swiss franc will therefore continue. Growth in the M1, M2 and M3 monetary aggregates has been perceptibly weaker since summer; this is primarily attributable to the rise in long-term interest rates. Liquidity held by households and companies has nevertheless remained high. In the past, a sustained high level of liquidity generally pointed to inflation risks. As a result of the financial crisis, however, this correlation cannot currently be made. Thus, in recent years, the inflation rate has remained exceptionally low despite a high level of liquidity. At present, there are no signs of a rise in inflation in Switzerland. Our inflation forecast shows no risk of inflation whatsoever. In addition, surveys on inflation expectations reveal values that are consistent with our definition of price stability. This applies not only to short-term inflation expectations, but also to long-term horizons of up to ten years. Furthermore, production capacity in Switzerland is still underutilised, which also makes a rapid rise in inflation unlikely. SNB monetary policy In conclusion, I would like to look at the SNB’s monetary policy. Overall economic conditions have hardly changed since summer. Consequently, monetary policy remains a challenge for the SNB. Up to now, our economy has performed relatively well, considering the difficult international environment. And we have not had to enforce the minimum exchange rate with foreign currency purchases since September 2012. Financial markets expect short-term interest rates to stay very low worldwide for some time to come. Furthermore, developments in the global economy are likely to remain uncertain. In this environment, the minimum exchange rate continues to be essential in ensuring appropriate monetary conditions in Switzerland. The guiding principle for our decisions is the SNB’s mandate to ensure price stability while taking due account of the development of the economy. The financial crisis also showed us, however, that price stability alone is not sufficient to ensure that the financial sector remains stable. In this connection, the situation on mortgage and real estate markets – which are showing considerable momentum – has been cause for concern for quite some time now. Also, mortgage lending is still growing faster than GDP, with the result that aggregate debt is increasing further. The countercyclical capital buffer is a new tool with which the resilience of banks can be strengthened and imbalances on mortgage and real estate markets can be addressed. My colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will now give you our assessment of the risks for financial stability. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Raghuram Rajan: Financial sector reforms Talk by Dr Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Delhi Economics Conclave 2013, Delhi, 11 December 2013. *      *      * The economy is stabilizing, but there is no room for complacency. Some part of improvement in the CAD has happened due to suppressing gold imports. Not all the measures to reduce fiscal deficit are of high quality. We have considerable work to do still. At the same time the country faces elections next year. A stable government post elections, while likely, cannot be taken for granted. This implies that all parties have to work together today to ensure that any government that emerges post-election has the time to come to terms with the challenges of managing the Indian economy. Otherwise, markets and rating agencies may not be willing to cut the new government any slack. More generally, it would be overly complacent and possibly dangerous for parties to postpone necessary legislation with the idea that they will pass bills post-election. Post-election politics may become even more challenging, whoever assumes power. Similarly, any slowdown in putting large stalled projects back on track before the elections or any fiscal slippage, will only amplify the already large challenges the new government will have to face. It will benefit the nation enormously if parliament passes key bills and if the current authorities continue to take actions to improve growth and fiscal health, including raising diesel prices to market levels and eliminating other poorly targeted subsidies. This Conclave, however, is about the medium term. Looking to the medium term, our measure of success should be the jobs that are created; Created not by giving government subsidies or protections to labour-intensive industries or sectors but by developing a facilitating, competitive, environment that will encourage efficiency and creativity. The job agenda requires a disciplined focus on 4 issues: 1)  We need to improve the quality of our infrastructure, especially the logistical support and power that industry and services need. Grand plans are on the anvil, such as the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. We need to complete such projects on time, and within budget. The success of the New Delhi Metro suggests that timeliness and cost control are not foreign to the Indian psyche. 2)  Our youth need education and training for the jobs that will be created. Some of this will be higher degrees, not just computer science but also design or civil engineering. Some of it will be appropriate vocational education that teaches them to be good plumbers and electricians rather than unemployable low-skilled engineers. In fact, teaching our citizens can be a stepping stone to teaching the world. India can be at the forefront of providing mass technology-enabled education with our professors providing appropriate human inputs to achieve the best mix of automation and customisation for learning. 3)  We need better business regulation. This does not always mean less regulation but it means regulation that is appropriate to the objective and, that is enforced. Entrepreneurs tell me about boiler inspectors showing up at software outfits, asking for the location of the boiler. The lack of change may be sheer inertia, but it may be more sinister rent-seeking. All too often, we have too much regulation on the books and too little regulation in practice, with the worst of the regulated finding unscrupulous ways around the regulation while the honest are stymied.  Even opening a business legitimately requires an enormous number of clearances and paperwork. In the same way as we have Saral form for filing income tax, could we have a Saral one page disclosure for opening a small business, with a single authority giving all necessary permissions? 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  4)  And finally, we need a better financial system, which will finance the needed infrastructure and the expansion of every producer ranging from the kirana shop owner to the industrialist. But finance is not only about credit. Equally important is for households to be able to save safely with positive real returns, insure themselves against health emergencies or old age costs, and borrow at low cost to finance consumption. They should be able to make remittances cheaply and pay at low cost. Importantly, the financial system should not require constant subsidies to bail it out. In the rest of this talk, I want to focus on what we, at the Reserve Bank, are doing to improve the financial system. We plan to build the Reserve Bank’s developmental measures over the next few quarters on five pillars. These are: 1.  Clarifying and strengthening the monetary policy framework. 2.  Strengthening banking structure through new entry, branch expansion, encouraging new varieties of banks, and moving foreign banks into better regulated organizational forms. 3.  Broadening and deepening financial markets and increasing their liquidity and resilience so that they can help allocate and absorb the risks entailed in financing India’s growth. 4.  Expanding access to finance for small and medium enterprises, the unorganized sector, the poor, and remote and underserved areas of the country through technology, new business practices, and new organizational structures; that is, we need financial inclusion. 5.  Improving the system’s ability to deal with corporate distress and financial institution distress by strengthening real and financial restructuring as well as debt recovery. Let me elaborate on each of these measures a little. First, we are among the large countries with the highest consumer price inflation in the world, even though growth is weaker than we would like it to be. Much of the inflation is concentrated in food and services. Our households are turning to gold because they find financial investments unattractive. At the same time, many industrial corporations are complaining about high interest rates because they cannot pass through their higher costs into higher prices for their products. We can spend a long time debating the sources of this inflation. But ultimately, inflation comes from demand exceeding supply, and it can be curtailed only by bringing both in balance. We need to reduce demand somewhat without having serious adverse effects on investment and supply. This is a balancing act, which requires the Reserve Bank to act firmly so that the economy is disinflating, even while allowing the weak economy more time than one would normally allow for it to reach a comfortable level of inflation. The weak state of the economy, the recent stability of the rupee, as well as the good Kharif and Rabi harvest this year, will generate disinflationary forces that will help, and we await data to see how these forces are playing out. No single data point or number will determine our next move. I think the market understands what we are trying to do. But we do need a more carefully spelled out monetary policy framework than we currently have. Action on the framework will follow the submission of the Dr. Urjit Patel Committee report, which is expected to submit its report by end December 2013. Second, we have already announced measures to free bank branching. We also want to incentivize foreign banks to incorporate domestically, which RBI has been planning since 2005. This will allow us to regulate them better and reduce the risks of contagion, stemming from foreign shores. This is a necessary measure to ensure the stability of our banking system. It is a measure which many other countries have embarked. Going forward, we have to give our public sector banks, which are a national asset, the means to improve their competitiveness. Many of them have made enormous strides in the last decade – for 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  instance, the extent to which they have digitized their operations is extremely praiseworthy – but because competition in the banking sector is likely to increase in the next few years, they cannot rest on their laurels. In the coming months, we will discuss with stakeholders in public sector banks about what needs to be done to further improve their stability, efficiency and productivity. Third, we need to enlist markets in the aid of financial institutions. Liquid markets will help banks offload risks they should not bear, such as interest rate or exchange risk. They will also allow banks to sell assets that they have no comparative advantage in holding, such as long term loans to completed infrastructure projects, which are better held by infrastructure funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. Liquid markets will help promoters raise equity, which is sorely needed in the Indian economy to absorb the risks that banks otherwise end up absorbing. Rather than seeing markets as being inimical to the development of the banking sector, we have to see them as complimentary. In the coming weeks, we will roll out more measures to improve the liquidity and depth of the G-Sec market. We will then turn to money markets and corporate debt markets. We have introduced new variants of interest rate futures and products like inflation indexed certificates, and we will continue to work to improve liquidity in derivative markets. As the exchange markets became unstable, we imposed restrictions on participation in these markets. We will remove these restrictions in a calibrated fashion. Fourth, we have to reach everyone, however remote or small, with financial services. Financial inclusion does not just mean credit for productive purposes, it means credit for paying a doctor to heal your child or to pay lumpy school or college fees. It means a safe mode of remunerated savings, and an easy way to make payments and remittances. It means insurance and pensions. It also means financial literacy and consumer protection. We have made great strides in inclusion, but we are still some distance from our goal. We have adopted a branch based strategy for inclusion, but it is not enough. Too many poor people in so-called “over-branched” urban areas still do not have access to banking services. We have many experiments under way to use technology, mobile phones, new products such as mobile wallets, and new entities as business correspondents to link people up to the formal financial system. Much as with cell phones where we created a frugal Indian model, we need a frugal, trustworthy, and effective Indian model for financial inclusion. The Dr. Nachiket Mor Committee is helping us think through possible models, and I am hopeful that when we outline measures based on its recommendations, our fine banks, NBFCs, IT companies and mobile players will rise to the occasion. The key will be to encourage entities to compete to serve the customers at the bottom of the pyramid. We should tolerate their making profit but not profiteering, and we will enhance our efforts in consumer protection and consumer literacy accordingly. And last but not the least, we have to deal better with distress; We have to ensure that the system recognizes financial distress early, takes steps to resolve it, and ensures fair recovery for lenders and investors. We could wish for a more effective judicial process or a better bankruptcy system, but while we await that, we have to improve the functioning of what we have. Next week, we propose to put out a paper for discussion that will focus on putting real assets back to work in their best use. The key elements to deal with distressed borrowers will include: (i)  Early formation of a lender committee with timelines for reaching agreement on a plan for resolution. (ii)  Stronger incentives for lenders to agree collectively and quickly to a plan – this will involve better regulatory treatment of stressed assets if a resolution plan is formulated and agreed to, accelerated provisioning if no agreement can be reached. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  (iii)  A mandated independent evaluation of large value restructurings, with a focus on plan viability and a fair sharing of losses (and future possible upside) between promoters and creditors. (iv) More expensive future borrowing for wilful defaulters or uncooperative defaulters who do not work with lenders to achieve an efficient and equitable resolution of distressed assets. (v) More liberal regulatory treatment of asset sales and more encouragement for new entities to purchase or refinance assets. The lesson of every period of financial stress across economies has been that early recognition and resolution of problems gives the economy its best chance of robust recovery. Through the measures that will be outlined next week, the RBI intends to help promoters and banks deal effectively with the financial stress that has built up. Let me conclude. I will depart from the usual conservatism of a central banker to predict that the best of India is yet to come. We will be a healthier, better educated, and richer nation, not just in absolute terms, but even relative to other countries. This is not a jingoistic statement based on some intrinsic Indian superiority but a sober recognition that we are still much poorer than other countries, and catching up is always easier than drawing away from the pack. But we can achieve these outcomes only if we go about addressing the challenges we face methodically, with discipline and a sense of national purpose. In the coming years, I hope that is what we will do.
