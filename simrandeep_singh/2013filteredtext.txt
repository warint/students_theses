 bi central bankers’ speech 1 haruhiko kuroda: the bank japan’s semiannual report currency monetary control statement mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, committee financial affairs, house representatives, tokyo, 26 march 2013. * * * introduction the bank japan submit diet semiannual report currency monetary control june december. most recently, bank submit report first half fiscal 2012 december 7, 2012. i please opportunity talk recent development japan’s economy present overall review bank’s conduct monetary policy. i. economic financial development japan first, i explain economic financial development japan. japan’s economy remain relatively weak since summer 2012 mainly background deceleration overseas economies, positive sign recently observed. the bank currently ass economy stop weakening. three factor point underlie development behind change economic situation. first, overseas economy – u.s. chinese economy particular – begin show sign emerge deceleration phase. the u.s. economy moderate recovery trend increase firmness, balance-sheet repair weigh economy gradually mitigated. private consumption increase moderately house investment show clear sign pick up, employment situation follow improve trend. business fix investment, constrained, show sign pick up. the chinese economy, albeit fluctuation exports, appear emerge deceleration phase support firm domestic demand, firmness private consumption rise infrastructure investment. meanwhile, economic activity europe continue recede slowly business fix investment private consumption decline partly due effect fiscal austerity tighten financial conditions, although deterioration business household sentiment come halt. second, business household sentiment improve mainly back recent depreciation yen rise stock prices. in global financial markets, investors’ risk aversion remain abated, partly due progress make policy response regard european debt problem since last summer fact u.s. “fiscal cliff” begin year avoided. nevertheless, development include situation surround european debt problem – particularly discussion support package cyprus development italy follow general election – require continue attention. third, factor exert downward pressure economy, effect decline car sale due end subsidy purchaser environmentally friendly car effect recent bilateral relationship japan china, fall diminished. under circumstances, export appear stop decreasing. business fix investment show weakness whole, although resilience observe nonmanufacturing. in contrast, public investment continue increase, house investment generally pick up. private consumption remain resilient, 2 bi central bankers’ speech support mainly demand elderly. reflect development demand home abroad, industrial production stop decreasing. with regard outlook, pick-up japan’s economy expect become evident around mid-2013, mainly background domestic demand remain firm partly owe steady implementation various economic measure overseas economy gradually emerge deceleration phase. financial condition japan accommodative. in term interest rates, overnight call rate remain extremely low level, firms’ fund cost hover low levels. with regard credit supply, firm continue see financial institutions’ lend attitude improve trend. issue condition cp corporate bond remain favorable whole. a credit demand, firm show sign increase demand mainly work capital fund relate merger acquisitions. in circumstances, firm retain recover financial position whole. on price front, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi, item le fresh food) around 0 percent. for next months, expect turn negative due reversal previous year’s movement energy-related durable consumer goods. thereafter, however, year-on-year rate change cpi expect start moderate increase trend aggregate supply demand balance continue moderate improve trend japan’s economy moderate recovery path. there remain high degree uncertainty concern japan’s economy, include prospect european debt problem, momentum toward recovery u.s. economy, possibility emerge commodity-exporting economy make smooth transition sustainable growth path, effect recent bilateral relationship japan china. recent development financial market appear assume global economy emerge deceleration phase pick up. the bank continue carefully examine whether uncertain factor surround global economy dispel smoothly. ii. conduct monetary policy next, i explain bank’s conduct monetary policy. japan’s economy suffer deflation nearly 15 years. this extraordinary situation even global scale. a vicious cycle – decline price cause wage profit contract, thereby reduce investment consumption, consequently lead decline price – cause deterioration japan’s economy. overcome deflation early possible time critical issue face japan’s economy. ensure price stability mandate central bank, role bank overcome deflation extremely important. the bank engage wide range effort – implement zero interest rate policy quantitative ease policy, pursue monetary ease consist comprehensive monetary easing, ensure financial market stability, provide support strengthen foundation economic growth recent year – fall short overcome deflation. there many factor – home abroad – exert downward pressure price japan: increase cheap import overseas, increase distribution efficiency mainly due deregulation, consequent low-price strategy firm well increase preference among household low prices. notwithstanding factors, bank’s mandate central bank achieve price stability address them. indeed, country world undergo prolong period deflation. the government announced, overcome deflation achieve economic revitalization, “three-pronged strategy” – consist bold monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy, growth strategy bi central bankers’ speech 3 encourage private sector investment – swiftly undertake response include emergency economic measures. an upturn stock price recently observed, positive response effort expectation economic recovery. of particular significance joint statement release january, government bank clearly set respective task announce determination accomplish task responsibility. this mark significant step toward overcome deflation achieve sustainable economic growth. the bank introduce “price stability target” 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi, decide price stability target would pursue monetary ease aim achieve target early possible time. the bank belief achievement target, without delay, mission utmost importance. so far bank – view overcome deflation – purchase variety asset sovereign debt well corporate bonds, cp, exchange-traded fund (etfs), real estate investment trust (reits). while purchase go beyond domain traditional central bank operations, scale type asset purchase sufficient materialize strong commitment achieve 2 percent inflation early possible time. we need pursue bold monetary ease term quantity quality. moreover, give little room interest rate decline, imperative work market expectation conduct monetary policy. through communication market, need make clear adopt uncompromising stance whatever necessary overcome deflation. furthermore, ensure cooperation government also important. the effect monetary policy reinforce maintain consistency government’s economic policies. accord joint statement release government bank, strengthen policy coordination work together order overcome deflation early achieve sustainable economic growth price stability. the government flexibly manage fiscal policy, formulate measure strengthen growth potential competitiveness japan’s economy, promote measure aim achieve fiscal consolidation medium long term. for part, bank responsibility pursue monetary ease view achieve price stability target early possible time. parallel monetary easing, government take initiative create real demand improve wage employment expansion consumption investment, expect contribute generate virtuous cycle eventually lead price increases. to avoid increase interest rate back decline confidence fiscal management, also important take measure aim achieve fiscal consolidation medium long term. we expect government take appropriate action line joint statement. for future conduct monetary policy, continue examine effective policy measures, monetary policy meetings, make full use bank’s resources, assess effect market examination economic price developments. bi central bankers’ speech 1 william c dudley: the economic outlook role monetary policy remark mr william c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york chairman committee global financial system (cgfs), economic club new york, new york city, 25 march 2013. * * * krishna guha, simon potter, jamie mcandrews, lorie logan, kevin stiroh, paolo pesenti, richard peach, jonathan mccarthy others staff help preparation remarks. clearly detail accompany chart speech find pdf document u federal reserve website. [for clarification, exhibit 8 14 revise indicate chart show fiscal years]. it pleasure opportunity speak economic club new york again. today, i focus economic outlook role monetary policy. i argue fundamental underpin u.s. economy improve monetary policy gain additional traction. but may immediately lead strong growth recent increase fiscal restraint. a result, i expect labor market condition improve slowly inflation remain muted. consequently, appropriate monetary policy remain accommodative. a always, view may necessarily reflect federal open market committee (fomc) federal reserve system. economic outlook: tug war improve fundamental fiscal restraint the u.s. economy remain slow growth track persist since recession end mid-2009. in fact, 2012 real gdp grow 1.6 percent, 2.2 percent rate precede two years. this lackluster disappoint performance mask fact underlie condition support growth gradually improving. however, near-term, improvement fundamental offset increase fiscal drag. let’s first examine fundamentals, improve least six ways. first, household deleveraging well advanced. household debt decline significantly relative income (exhibit 1). in vein, household financial obligation ratio fall level last see early 1980s (exhibit 2).1 second, structural adjustment house largely run course. activity price firming, support low interest rates. over past four quarters, house start rise 33 percent, exist home sale climb 12 percent (exhibit 3), home prices, measure corelogic national home price index, 7 percent (exhibit 4). although pace recovery vary regionally, u.s. house sector whole clearly rebounding. i see recovery home price particularly important. house significant component household wealth. in addition, home price begin rise likely see transaction build activity. moreover, rise house price likely encourage loosen credit appraisal standard remain unduly tight. third, international economic outlook improve somewhat. global financial market strain relate concern euro-area recede since last summer, though 1 the household obligation ratio sum payment mortgage nonmortgage debt, automobile lease payments, rental payment tenant-occupied property, homeowners’ insurance, property tax payment divide disposable after-tax income. 2 bi central bankers’ speech recent development cyprus highlight challenge remain. chinese growth appear climb slowdown 2012 japan make renew effort grow fast exit long period deflation. fourth, u.s. corporate profit relative national income all-time record (exhibit 5) cash balance high. a uncertainty recede outlook improves, i expect business increasingly shift towards real investment mainly buy back share hoard cash. fifth, u.s. middle energy revolution mark steady rise oil natural gas production (exhibit 6). just significant, sharp fall natural gas price u.s. create huge impetus investment energy-intensive manufacturing, petrochemicals. because lead time investment long, impulse likely persist many years. sixth, financial condition become increasingly accommodative, monetary ease pass broad range financial asset prices. credit spread narrow u.s. equity market rise sharply (exhibit 7). the price availability type consumer loans, notably auto loans, also improved. so isn’t u.s. economy grow quickly? the fact fiscal policy turn significantly restrictive important reason. the impulse state local government subtract growth early recovery go negative close neutral. but overwhelm sharp shift federal fiscal policy mild restraint 2012 much great restraint 2013 (exhibit 8). the increase payroll tax rates, rise high income tax rates, increase tax associate affordable care act, sequester – sustain – result fiscal drag 1 3/4 percentage point gdp 2013.2 i view unfortunate outcome. while u.s. must put public finance sustainable footing, do manner best achieve near-term long-term objectives. in opinion, u.s. fiscal policy well-suited current set circumstance would start mild degree restraint near-term would credibly build substantial consolidation next several decades. of course, congress judge combination tax increase spend cut undertake achieve this. nevertheless, age population simple math suggest entitlement reform would need part plan. also, ideal world, fiscal policy would broad-based bipartisan support. that would reduce uncertainty reassure household business u.s. sustainable long-term path. instead, nearly opposite: significant retrenchment near-term, credible action long-term, partisan division significant uncertainty happen next. will sequester, example, sustain not? economic outlook look outlook 2013, i believe growth first half sluggish fiscal contraction blunt economy’s forward advance. while first quarter gdp growth likely rebound 2 3 percent annualized rate follow dip fourth quarter, due large part temporary factors.3 2 before take account fiscal multipliers. 3 this include modest boost inventory investment follow substantial drag prior quarter, recovery farm output follow last year’s drought, le drag defense outlay follow steep plunge fourth quarter. rebuild follow devastation superstorm sandy may also provide temporary lift quarter. bi central bankers’ speech 3 i’d also emphasize remain considerable uncertainty outlook. in particular, can’t confident much fiscal drag blunt growth. ultimately, though, drag abate. when happen – presumably late year, economy strengthen. inflation, measure personal consumption expenditure deflator, currently federal reserve’s 2 percent objective (exhibit 9). substantial slack remain labor product markets, underlie measure inflation subdued. with weak labor compensation growth, trend growth unit labor cost le 1 percent annualized, well price inflation. moreover, inflation expectation remain well anchor level consistent 2 percent longer-run objective. thus, i conclude risk inflation could significantly exceed 2 percent objective quite low next years, even recovery strengthen considerably. u.s. monetary policy initiative begin september, fomc make number important change monetary policy order promote strong recovery context price stability. first, fomc begin purchase additional $40 billion agency mortgage-backed security (mbs) month.4 second, fomc stated, first time, would continue buy asset employ policy tool appropriate substantial improvement labor market outlook5. third, fomc state intention maintain highly accommodative stance monetary policy considerable time recovery strengthens. two additional initiative follow december. first, consistent september statement, fomc begin new purchase program $45 billion long-dated treasury per month. second, fomc shift economic threshold calendar-based rate guidance. the fomc commit keep federal fund rate current level zero 25 basis point least long unemployment remain 6.5 percent, project inflation one two year horizon 2.5 percent inflation expectation stay well anchored. both element policy stance reaffirm last week’s fomc meeting. so make changes? the additional asset purchase provide monetary stimulus. this appropriate give fall short objectives.6 move outcome-based purchase program also advantages. in particular, expectation ultimate amount purchase change economic outlook evolves. this act automatic stabilize mechanism. in particular, fomc’s statement purchase continue labor market outlook improve substantially provide additional support recovery reduce downside tail risk. the shift rate guidance base economic threshold intend provide additional accommodation time implemented.7 but, adoption threshold support recovery change risk profile different way. the threshold 4 in addition reinvestment mature mbs. 5 at time fomc purchase additional $45 billion month longer-dated treasury security sell equivalent amount shorter-dated security maturity extension program. 6 while specify current monthly pace purchase degree stimulus depend mainly expectation ultimate size purchase long expect hold asset acquired. 7 this make clear fomc statement committee expect reach unemployment rate threshold time early date guidance. 4 bi central bankers’ speech make clear short-term rate raise first sign economic improvement, sustainable recovery secured. a result, household business confident undertake additional spend investment today. the shift thresholds-based rate guidance benefits. relative calendar-based guidance, provide information economic condition feed would need see raise rates.8 importantly, shift threshold also make eventual normalization monetary policy smoother, subject i return later. but raise obvious question. if quantitative threshold good interest rate guidance, also threshold asset purchase program? there two reasons. there somewhat uncertainty efficacy cost associate asset purchase rate guidance likely learn efficacy cost program unfolds. so likely mean practice? in view, calibrate total amount purchase need deliver substantial improvement labor market conditions, allow flow rate purchase respond material change labor market outlook. this make sense benefits9 additional accommodation gradually diminish get close full employment price stability objective become confident reach timely manner.10 at point, i expect i see sufficient evidence economic momentum cause favor gradually dial back pace asset purchases.11 of course, subsequent bad news could lead favor dial back again. a chairman bernanke say press conference last wednesday “when see the…situation change meaningful way, may well adjust pace purchase order keep level accommodation consistent outlook.” the labor market outlook so relative objective substantial improvement labor market outlook? since provide additional stimulus september improvement labor market conditions. the unemployment rate modestly low private non-farm payroll growth bite high early 2012, certainly welcome. however, important indicator include employment-to-population ratio job-finding rate essentially unchanged (exhibit 10). this suggest labor market far healthy. moreover, policy base outlook labor market, level employment unemployment today. in context i note recent improvement payroll employment growth, get much attention, out-sized relative growth rate economic activity support it. we see movie before. when happen 2011 2012, employment growth subsequently slow (see exhibit 11). 8 it avoid ambiguity change forward rate guidance would signal. be date move out, example, fomc want provide additional accommodation move due deterioration economic forecast? 9 i draw distinction efficacy benefit. in view, benefit additional accommodation would diminish get close dual mandate objective become confident forecast strengthen recovery, even assessment efficacy cost tool unchanged. 10 of course, expectation assume new information efficacy cost emerge fundamentally change assessment merit program. 11 assume improvement outlook endogenous choose policy set extent would disappear purchase slowed. bi central bankers’ speech 5 because growth year constrain fiscal consolidation, risk could happen again. a result, premature conclude soon see substantial improvement labor market outlook. efficacy asset purchase program exceed cost our asset purchase also conditional ongoing evaluation efficacy program exceed costs. that clearly case date – affirm policy decisions. since put outcome-based approach place september, assessment efficacy high high i expect onset program, cost lower. efficacy two components: effect purchase financial condition effect financial condition economy. our late purchase program associate substantial ease financial conditions, high equity prices, narrow credit spreads. the resumption additional agency mb purchase september push mb yields. with lag, much drop yield pass primary mortgage rates. meanwhile, impact improvement financial condition real economy somewhat strong i expected. since september see considerable strength interest-sensitive sector economy, include housing, auto durable goods, spite uncertainty drag fiscal policy. improvement sector suggest monetary policy may gain additional traction. this important suggest benefit give amount asset purchase increased. on cost side, i conclude cost specific balance sheet expansion turn great i anticipate and, le uncertainty costs, low i would expect risk-adjusted sense. let start three commonly cite potential cost – impairment market functioning, unanchoring inflation expectations, threat financial stability. we carefully monitor financial market sign market function impaired, look metric trade volumes, bid-offer spreads, failure deliver security ability execute transactions. on metrics, market function actually improve recent months. of course, need continue monitor this, particularly rise interest rate lead le mb issuance. but far, good. in term inflation expectations, wide range measure remain well anchored. for example, 5-year, 5-year forward measure inflation expectation calculate treasury tip versus nominal yield well within historical range recent year (exhibit 12). in contrast, assess potential cost term financial stability difficult. indeed, clear way sign goes. do asset purchase increase reduce financial stability risks? on one hand, information receive since september suggest slightly great reason concern potential excess certain corner financial markets. in particular, area fix income – notably high-yield bond leverage loan – seem somewhat frothy. however, i view expect cost society bad outcome relatively low. the broad rapid credit creation associate dangerous type asset bubble absent (exhibit 13). the size asset class question relatively modest investor asset highly leveraged. so asset valuation adjust sharply investor experience painful losses, i expect shock would threaten financial stability. 6 bi central bankers’ speech nevertheless, need keep close eye financial asset prices. a i note first speech economic club new york 3 year ago: “despite fact hard discern bubbles, especially early stages, i conclude uncertainty grind inaction. instead, decision whether act depend whether appropriate tool deploy limit size bubble whether benefit act deploy tool likely exceed costs.”12 on hand, financial stability case purchase current context. to extent risky behavior incipient asset price bubble fuel expectation interest rate “low long,” asset purchase strengthen economic recovery bring forward date liftoff promote financial stability. also, extent asset purchase increase likelihood sustainable recovery, reduce financial stability risk associate japanese-style outcome chronic deflation. although cost specific asset purchase program appear well-contained, also true cost increase program get larger. in part, due fact balance sheet increase size, risk period low zero remittance treasury also increases. a acquire longer-dated asset fund reserves, feed take interest rate risk. this policy works. a byproduct net income remittance unusually elevate while, likely fall substantially period, return normal levels. this interest expense increase substantially begin normalize rates. also, sell asset rise rate environment, could also experience capital loss sales. in combination, depend future trajectory short long rates, remittance could even fall zero period.13 there several important point make here. first, potential impact purchase program future feed remittance know onset program – new information here. the outcome depend economy evolves, respond, whether decide sell long-dated asset portfolio not. second, important put excessive weight possibility period zero remittances. our mandate economic fiscal – job return economy full employment price stability. moreover, consider fiscal consequence actions, matter happen remittance – far narrow perspective – action affect federal debt-to-gdp ratio time. this metric focus assess potential fiscal consequence actions. in respect, important note narrow impact feed remittance federal debt-to-gdp ratio depend cumulative amount, time remittances. cumulative remittance date hundred billion dollar higher, else equal, compare federal reserve expand balance sheet. and, accord congressional budget office projections, even remittance drop sharply future years, cumulative remittance would still likely high compare counterfactual regime feed expand balance sheet (exhibit 14). in addition, feed purchase put downward pressure long-term interest rates, 12 asset bubble implication central bank policy, economic club new york, april 7, 2010. 13 if fed’s net income fell zero year would record defer asset would redeem future net income. pay capital surplus would remain positive wide range scenarios. see the federal reserve’s balance sheet earnings: a primer projection , seth b. carpenter, jane e. ihrig, elizabeth c. klee, daniel w. quinn, alexander h. boote, finance economics discussion series, board governor federal reserve system, 2013-01. see also soma annual report (forthcoming). bi central bankers’ speech 7 generate interest save treasury, benefit include fiscal cost calculations. finally, importantly, extent asset purchase effective push trajectory economic growth would otherwise case, lead high federal government tax revenue low safety net spend outlay recovery period. this mean across broad range scenarios, large-scale asset purchase program likely result low federal debt-to-gdp ratio. to sum up, good choice feed pursue policy best achieve mandate objective put u.s. government good fiscal position. this dominate policy few purchase simply avoid potentially explain remittance may fall zero short period. issue associate normalization monetary policy finally, i’d like talk issue associate normalization monetary policy. in general, i think premature spend much time focus exit yet secure sustainable economic recovery. that’s put cart horse opinion. that said, nevertheless need understand issue surround exit design best monetary policy regime achieve objectives. on topic, let ease three concern i hear frequently expressed. the first large amount excess reserve bank system “dry tinder” fuel rise inflation. a i mention repeatedly, ability federal reserve pay interest excess reserve ensure control credit creation process prevent upsurge inflation. the second feed ultimately raise rate pay excess reserves, provide subsidy banks. ioer subsidy banks.14 in attract deposit liabilities, competition among banks15 ensure high interest payment bank reserve pass bank liability holders. i look forward day economy strong enough u raise interest rate excess reserves. when happens, deposit rate also rise. that important ultra-low rate burden many senior others heavily reliant kind income. when raise ioer, mother mother-in-law others like them, bankers, mainly benefit. the third concern notion federal reserve slow tighten monetary policy reduce amount remittance treasury. this add up. the feed central bank, asset management company – commitment dual mandate economic objective – maximize net income remittances. 14 when feed create reserve balances, bank force either add deposit liability match increase assets, reduce assets, sell securities, example. in either responses, bank experience cost manage reserves. 15 among many changes, dodd-frank act allow bank pay interest corporate deposits, depositors, deposit large amounts, likely interest-sensitive, individual depositors. furthermore, wholesale money market intensely competitive, and, evidence reserve distribute across bank way reflect competitive considerations, note currently, reserve hold disproportionately large amount foreign bank organizations. the reason i think happen fbos pay fdic assessment fee liability (as hold u.s. deposits). that suggest bank face competition attract liability match reserve holdings, fbos, face low cost so, manage attract deposit fast clip domestic banks. this sort competition i expect see result interest reserve pass bank customer broad economy. 8 bi central bankers’ speech moreover, even put weight consideration, incentive go way – enlarge balance sheet create additional reason tighten monetary policy timely way. if feed delay raise short-term rate protect current earnings, inflation would rise would push long-term rate higher. this would necessitate big rise short-term interest rate great loss earn later. a much important issue respect policy normalization moderate risk sharp snapback longer-term yields. but le size balance sheet specifically challenge normalize current stance monetary policy dimensions. there always risk market participant foreshorten fed’s actions. market participant could collapse extend sequence step back date first move towards normalization result abrupt tighten financial conditions. the move economic thresholds-based guidance feed fund rate help regard. while threshold certainly triggers, help market participant adjust expectation likely time liftoff relatively continuous manner guard expectation pull forward time warrant change economic outlook. nevertheless, need communicate broad intention clearly. even purchase cease, enlarge balance sheet provide substantial ongoing stimulus. it important recognize feed could remain posture policy “on hold” significant period. a threshold framework make clear, fix time-frame complete purchase raise short term rates. long-term yield rise sharply 1994 2004 economic recovery get underway earnest sustain period unusually low short-term rates. compare episodes, risk spike long-dated yield time around may somewhat low two reasons. first, risk receive much attention. big market move typically associate surprises. for market reprice suddenly, i presume would need new information lead investor significantly revise view outlook fed's reaction function. second, fed's expansion balance sheet may stabilize influence. for example, rise interest rate prior episode amplify convexity-related hedge generate lengthen expect mortgage duration. this le powerful force time around feed hold substantial portion agency mb market. however, keep guard. the regulatory community must continue take step mitigate vulnerability economy sharp rise long-term rates. this include monitor banks’ exposure duration risk quality risk management capital planning, also look outside bank system risk may reside elsewhere. in regard, agency mortgage reit risk large outflow bond mutual fund issue deserve ongoing attention. conclusion the fomc commit dual objective maximum sustainable employment context price stability. currently fall well short employment objective restrictive stance federal fiscal policy factor. on inflation, also fall short, considerably small margin. a consequence, need keep monetary policy accommodative. i claim cost risk associate unconventional monetary policy regime. but i see great cost risk move prematurely policy set might prove sufficiently accommodative ensure sustainable, strengthen recovery. bi central bankers’ speech 9 i remain confident benefit strong early economic recovery trump cost associate unconventional monetary policy measures. thank kind attention. i would happy take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 prasarn trairatvorakul: current topic economy monetary policy kingdom speech dr prasarn trairatvorakul, governor bank thailand, japanese chamber commerce dinner talk, bangkok, 25 march 2013. * * * good evening, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, i would like thank japanese chamber commerce (jcc) invite give keynote speech special annual event. it honor back prominent institution presence thailand half century, contribute development trade investment, well promote japan-thailand friendship cultural exchange technical support. for special evening, i would like reflect recent development global thai economy, challenge monetary policy go forward. first all, let’s look back happen last year. in 2012, thailand face series challenge domestic external fronts. the global economy subject main drag euro debt crisis, uncertainty remain recovery process u japan. these advance country face number structural problem would, course, take time resolve. however, encourage see overall global economy continue gradual recovery path, improve outlook particularly u japan, china asia remain robust. the chinese economy, particular, sweet spot rebound growth low inflation, room public investment. asian economy also perform well mainly due strong domestic demand. last year, thai economy grow robustly higher-than-expected rate 6.4 percent. even though impact still weak global demand become apparent latter half year, spillover beyond merchandise export export-oriented manufacture production limited. factor support domestic economy include private reconstruction investment flood, domestic consumption support favorable wage employment condition well government stimulus measures. inflation 2012 remain low 3 percent, core inflation average 2.1 percent well within bank thailand’s target range. this year expect growth momentum thai economy continue, amidst remain uncertainty global economy. the u manage avoid so-called fiscal cliff, although uncertainty surround sequestration process still remain. structural reform euro area continue slowly course. japan also optimistic outlook, give series government stimulus measure pull country deflation. improve outlook global economy underpin gradual recovery export asian economies, include thailand. we forecast gdp growth year 4.9 percent. however, give strong than-expected gdp growth 2012, forecast likely revise next release april. inflation expect remain low, headline inflation around 2.8 percent. the second round minimum wage increase unlikely significant impact inflationary pressure, give many firm able make necessary adjustment reduce cost increase productivity shift capital-intensive production. robust domestic demand continue major driver thai economy. private consumption back many supportive factor first-car scheme previous year cut personal income tax accommodative monetary fiscal 2 bi central bankers’ speech policies. private investment also expect expand well, give crowding-in effect public infrastructure investment projects. export sector pick pace towards latter half year back moderate recovery global economy. nevertheless, still many challenge lie ahead thai economy. the state global economy, improve somewhat, remain fragile. and firm recovery still subject risk uncertainties. domestically, although inflation seem benign, possibility rise inflation pressure oil price global demand start pick gradually. supply constraints, mainly tight labor market, may also add wage-price inflation future. a central bank, always remain vigilant price stability. of immediate concern; however, potential threat financial stability stem development asset price well household indebtedness. activity increasingly active stock market real estate market. we see construction condominium residential house bangkok, peripheral major province around country price project go rather fast. we also see household debt trend upward 70 percent gdp. we continue watchful make sure situation get hand threaten financial economic stability. lady gentlemen, this lead u second part talk evening. give recent economic financial development i mentioned, clear that, monetary policy maker, bank thailand face challenge strike right balance economic growth macro-economic stability. it easy determine appropriate policy, thus policy decision always make careful considerations, take account economic stability aspects. last year, main concern ensure growth recovery floods. policy interest rate cut twice view provide accommodative conducive environment growth. this help accelerate recovery aftermath flood support domestic demand face global economic slowdown. at time, bank thailand make sure core inflation remain within target concurrently, ensure macroeconomic financial stability. there continuous effort enhance stability surveillance years. last year, joint meet monetary policy committee financial institution policy committee first hold purpose share idea different perspectives. it set stage committee regularly monitor exchange view systemic risk might occur interconnectedness economic financial sector form policy response, measure necessary. for year, bank thailand continue make sure overall economic condition stay safe sound. yet, balance among different policy objective reach ultimate goal macroeconomic stability even challenge year, give possible risk financial stability global environment still surround uncertainties. in closing, i would like outline key challenge face bank thailand year: first, monetary policy. since main goal conduct monetary policy ensure sustainable economic growth, mpc’s decision-making always base risk economic growth, inflation, well financial stability. this year, challenge would strike right balance economic growth financial stability inflationary pressure well contain short run. give buoyant domestic spending, keep policy interest rate low long could give incentive private sector borrow more. furthermore, low interest rate encourage depositor switch invest risky asset could lead problem asset price bubble future. therefore, important u take care financial system stability well conduct bi central bankers’ speech 3 monetary policy. the bank thailand closely monitor expansion private sector’s loan assess ability debt repayment private sectors, especially middle low income groups. second, exchange rate policy, main challenge thai baht appreciate trend due various factors, include capital inflow surge region, structural change world economy, growth differential advance emerge economy well accommodative monetary policy advance economies. generally, allow exchange rate determine market serve automatic stabilizer short-term important price signal catalyst structural change long term. so, first line defense, exchange rate determine market mechanism market assessment, thai baht still remain broadly line economic fundamentals. however, bot stand ready use policy instrument disposal prevent manage dysfunctional market conditions, excessive speculation exchange rate overshooting. it note also that, baht appreciation juncture provide opportunity business upgrade technology productivity. give scarce labor increase wages, production thailand need shift labor intensive capital intensive industry thus import capital good machinery make cheap investment up-cycle. third, capital flow management. in october 2012, bank thailand launch capital account liberalisation master plan. this master plan aim facilitate thai company diversify investment abroad, especially neighbor countries. this would encourage private company operate business efficiently expand market production bases, turn help strengthen competitiveness. facilitate outflow also help capital flow balanced. the bank thailand, instance, remove limit thai individuals’ outward direct investment, raise limit per investor, ease regulation transfer foreign currency facilitate investment foreign securities. recent surge capital inflow region likely continue long advance country continue extra-loose monetary policy long prospect region remain much positive advance economies. there one-size-fits-all measure deal impact short term capital inflow economy. the bank thailand thus utilize policy combinations, namely: allow exchange rate adjustment first buffer; liberalise outward investment residents; exercise exchange rate intervention deal excessive movements; circumstance deem necessary, bank thailand prepare consider appropriate measure order prevent serious impact economy. last least, monetary policy, still concern structural problem thai economy medium long term. give tight labor market increase wage costs, need improve country’s infrastructure productivity. this involve upgrade technology innovation move thailand value chain. the well-being workforce, well quality education train also crucial increase competitiveness ahead aec integration. this cannot do one party. long-term coherent vision concert effort among agencies, public private, needed. lady gentlemen, to close remark evening, i believe jcc big role shape thailand’s future i hope long history partnership japan thailand, continue close cooperation aspect year come. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 agathe côté: toward strong financial market infrastructure canada – take stock remark m agathe côté, deputy governor bank canada, association financial professional canada (montreal chapter), montreal, 26 march 2013. * * * introduction it’s pleasure today. i go take advantage audience financial professional talk financial market infrastructure, subject affect every single person one way another – you, nature work, others. usually, people talk infrastructure, think road transportation systems. montrealers, like everyone life big city, know well happen city’s infrastructure system weak fails: delays, disruption kinds, various degree chaos. the nature infrastructure truly understand importance fail us. the go financial market infrastructure. virtually financial transaction cleared, settle record financial market infrastructure (fmis). fmis allow consumer firm safely efficiently purchase good services, make financial investments, transfer funds. give critical role fmis, risk management paramount importance; indeed, subject “systemic risk” hot topic discussion infrastructure long recent financial crisis. over past twenty years, steady stream improvements, example, develop payment system safely settle foreign exchange transaction across time zones. these improvement prove worth crisis. despite numerous institutional failure around world extreme level uncertainty risk aversion, fmis continue perform critical functions. the crisis also highlight importance one type fmi particular – central counterparties (ccps). a ccp act buyer every seller seller every buyer financial transaction clears. an appropriately risk-controlled ccp improve market’s resilience reduce counterparty credit risk and, therefore, potential disruption transmit financial system. this help essential market remain continuously open, even time severe stress. a ccp also provide enhance net efficiency members, help manage default control manner. for example, lehman brother default, one memorable dramatic recent crisis, would even bad london clear house, ccp large portion otc interest rate derivatives, manage default well did. more generally, saw market serve ccps tend resilient crisis bilaterally settle markets. give track record, surprise market infrastructure, ccps particular,

markets, market government bonds. cdc develop facilitate continuously open repo market, help prevent repeat severe liquidity crunch occur market recent financial crisis.2 in short time since begin operations, cdc expand product offerings, add participant see steady increase average daily value clear system. this good, enough. at present, 10 15 per cent repo transaction clear cdc – nearly enough ensure market remain open time stress. while canada’s major bank security broker-dealer currently cdc participants, majority canadian repo trade involve least one non-cdcs participant one side transaction.3 since cdc cannot clear trade unless counterparties participants, able materially increase proportion repo market serf without capture broad set participants. clearly, challenge get participant board, several issue must address institution participate give current cdc model. for instance, small dealer may will able meet daily operational demand actively participate action necessary manage exposure event default. and large buy-side firms, particular, pension funds, currently meet requirement direct membership.4 pension fund participation especially important institution one side large proportion repo transactions. cdcc member already work find way group participate. cdcc consider set mechanism would allow small firm clear indirectly – is, direct member provide clear services. this tried-and-true approach, one well understand financial institutions. 1 in addition fixed-income repo transactions, cdc centrally clear option future trade mx over-the-counter (otc) equity options. 2 p. chatterjee, l. embree p. youngman, “reducing systemic risk: canada’s new central counterparty fixed-income market,” bank canada financial system review (june 2012): 43–49. 3 the current cdc participant are: bank montreal, cibc world market inc., desjardins security inc., merrill lynch canada inc., morgan stanley canada limited, national bank canada, nbcn inc., rbc dominion

pension fund generally fall either categories. bi central bankers’ speech 3 current cdc participant role play facilitate initiative. they need consider whether provide clear service small institution and, choose so, develop capacity take business. they also need determine manage exposure customers. for large pension funds, indirect membership may viable option, give concentration risk would result entity clear single direct participant. cdcc industry examine approach would allow entity directly participate ccp way risk manage without require subject mutualized loss-sharing arrangements. it important effort determine exact detail arrangement could work practice pursued. the bank canada strongly support work currently undertake cdcc investment industry association canada increase participation ccp. the bank continue involve ensure solution put place meet high standard risk management. while cost participate cdcs, benefit substantial, reap normal time time stress. not canadian financial system benefit repos centrally cleared, current future participant benefit increase net efficiency reduce counterparty credit risk. these benefit enhance industry develop generalize collateral repo product, security predetermine basket instrument serve collateral. this product increase liquidity efficiency canadian repo market. the central clear otc interest rate derivative increase let turn another effort strengthen financial stability use ccps. i’m sure well aware g-20 leaders’ commitment standardize over-the-counter (otc) derivative clear ccps. canadian authorities, like member country financial stability board (fsb), decide last autumn would allow institution meet g-20 commitment use ccp recognize canadian authorities, include global ccps.5 while ccp canada would provide straightforward oversight capacity canadian authority intervene mitigate risks, needed, many advantage global solution. global ccps good promote liquidity efficiency largely global otc derivative market. a global ccp make financial system robust shock allow derivative user appropriately manage risk.6 the result though that, globally, likely concentration transaction small number ccps – truly become international systemically important financial institutions. to address concentration risk ensure local authority tool need protect local markets, fsb develop safeguard global clearing. these safeguard mean global ccps must: • provide fair open access; 5 this preclude development use local ccp future. 6 see december financial system review detail analysis:

progress bank canada consider swapclear systemically important, become subject bank oversight 2 april. designation, minister finance agree public interest, give bank authority responsibility assure swapclear appropriate effective risk control place. the bank belief combination co-operative oversight swapclear tool come designation provide bank ability effectively control systemic risk within critical market thereby improve resilience canadian financial system. hold financial market infrastructure stringent risk-management standard the last area reform i want discus today new risk-management standard systemically important financial market infrastructures. in 2010, committee payment settlement system (cpss) international organization security commission (iosco) initiate complete review risk-management standards. the goal make standard consistent current best practice reflect experience authority apply them, take account lesson learn financial crisis. the result principle financial market infrastructure finalize last year. the new standard considerably stringent previous one sharpen focus control systemic risk. they place strong emphasis governance, require fmis comprehensive risk-management framework place hold substantially financial resources. the bank canada adopt principle apply fmis oversees.8 all fmis – include canada – need make improvement risk-management practice meet new standards. at moment, designate fmi 7 the big five canadian bank direct clear member swapclear. 8 in addition cdcs, bank oversee large value transfer system (lvts), canada’s main electronic funds-transfer system; cdsx, canada’s security settlement system central security depository; canadian-dollar leg cl bank, global payment system settlement foreign exchange transactions, include involve canadian dollar. bi central bankers’ speech 5 undertake rigorous analysis practice new principles, identify gap develop plan address them. the bank canadian regulator work closely fmis ensure timely compliance. what mean participants, firms, change fmi’s risk-management practice move meet new standards. new risk-management practice mean high cost fmis impact participants. in cases, also high collateral requirements, great assurance transaction carry accord wish participants, good time bad. fmis inform participant upcoming change work details. we way, we’re yet so leave us? emerge crisis, key element international reform strengthen financial system reinforce fmis. the goal reduce systemic risk keep essential market continuously open. in canada, make much progress create ccp fixed-income repos substantially increase share otc derivative interest rate market centrally cleared. a well, put place new, rigorous international standard fmis. it impressive much accomplished, done. we recognize many improvement involve costs, time money, financial service sector. i want understate commitment require stakeholders. but benefit greatly outweigh costs. and time stop slow down. it essential continue invest financial market infrastructure. with continue investments, assurance fmis serve u well future. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ben s bernanke: monetary policy global economy speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system, department economics sticerd (suntory toyota international centre economics relate disciplines) public discussion association bank england, london school economics, london, 25 march 2013. * * * i’m please participate conference honor good friend mervyn king. a mervyn note recent speech new york, adjoin office mit young academic never imagine 30 year late still would colleague – central bankers.1 now, then, i value advice insight. the topic session lesson learn financial crisis. for me, perhaps central insight recent crisis, despite many exotic features, fact classic financial panic – systemwide run “hot money” away asset whose value suddenly become uncertain. in respect, crisis akin many financial crisis face government central bank – include venerable central banks, bank england – centuries. the response crisis likewise follow classic prescription liquidity provision, liability guarantees, asset evaluation disposition, recapitalization necessary. although crisis classic features, significant extent take place novel institutional context, make diagnosis response challenging: for example, unite states, collateralize wholesale fund rather conventional bank deposit constitute hot money, run pressure experience bank diverse institutions, structure investment vehicles. in addition, scale complexity globalize financial institution market make difficult predict crisis might spread coordinate response. one positive aspect episode extraordinary degree international cooperation achieve among policymakers, include bank england federal reserve, respond crisis. because i develop theme detail elsewhere, i think today i would tackle different recent issue arise aftermath crisis – issue whether, widespread ease monetary policies, see competitive depreciation exchange rates.2 like aspect crisis, notion competitive depreciation strong classical antecedents, particularly relation global great depression 1930s. so let start briefly revisit old discussion evolution. a audience knows, eve great depression exchange rate industrial country determine rule international gold standard – or, technically, gold-exchange standard, foreign exchange (primarily dollar pound sterling) use along gold form international reserves. the gold standard, suspend world war i, painstakingly rebuild 1920s. unfortunately, reconstruct gold standard number serious problems. 1 see mervyn a. king (2012), “talk economic club new york,” speech deliver

“rethinking finance: perspective crisis,” conference sponsor russell sage foundation the century foundation, new york, april 13. see also ben s. bernanke (2010), “causes recent financial economic crisis,” statement financial crisis inquiry commission, september 2. 2 bi central bankers’ speech for one, exchange rate imply gold valuation country choose currency follow world war i case far level consistent balance flow trade payments. notably, john maynard keynes point famous pamphlet, the economic consequence mr. churchill, british pound overvalue new gold standard, disadvantage british export contribute weak economic condition unite kingdom late 1920s.3 one mervyn king’s predecessor governor bank england, montagu norman, preside britain’s return gold standard subsequent exit, say ill-fated choice parity pound: “only god could tell whether [the value gold choose pound sterling] correct figure”; another commentator added, “but course deity may economist.”4 another problem, become clear global economy weaken financial condition deteriorated, fix exchange rate gold standard vulnerable speculative runs. although runs, case policy decisions, effectively take number country gold standard early 1930s, financial world shake foundation unite kingdom, unofficial center global gold standard, force speculative attack leave gold september 1931. over next five years, essentially world’s industrial nation leave gold standard, either de facto de jure. decline value depart nation’s currency, sometimes sharp ones, typically followed. the uncoordinated abandonment gold standard early 1930s give rise idea “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies. accord analysis, put forth important contemporary economist like joan robinson, exchange rate depreciation help economy whose currency weaken make country competitive internationally.5 indeed, decline value pound 1931 associate relatively early recovery depression unite kingdom, part rebound exports. however, accord view, gain depreciate country equal exceed loss trade partners, become le internationally competitive – hence, “beggar thy neighbor.” over time, so-called competitive depreciation become associate mind historian tariff war follow passage smoot-hawley tariff unite states. both type policy decry – textbooks, still – prolong depression disrupt trade pattern lead ultimately fruitless destructive battle shrink international markets. economist still agree smoot-hawley ensue tariff war highly counterproductive contribute depth length global depression. however, modern research depression, begin seminal 1985 paper barry eichengreen jeffrey sachs, change view effect abandonment gold standard.6 although true leave gold standard result currency depreciation confer temporary competitive advantage cases, modern research show primary benefit leave gold free country use appropriately expansionary monetary policies. by 1935 1936, essentially major country leave gold standard exchange rate market-determined, 3 see john maynard keynes (1925), the economic consequence mr. churchill (london: hogarth press). 4 a quote c.a.e. goodhart (1972), review british monetary policy 1924–1931: the norman conquest $4.86, d.e.

bankers’ speech 3 net trade effect change currency value certainly small. yet global economy whole much strong 1931. the reason that, shed strait jacket gold standard, country become free use monetary policy way commensurate achieve full employment home. moreover, critically, country also benefit strong growth trade partner purchase exports. in sharp contrast tariff wars, monetary reflation 1930s positive-sum exercise, whose benefit come mainly high domestic demand countries, trade diversion arise change exchange rates. the lesson present clear. today advance industrial economy remain, vary extents, grip slow recovery great recession. with inflation generally contained, central bank country provide accommodative monetary policy support growth. do policy constitute competitive devaluations? to contrary, monetary policy accommodative great majority advance industrial economies, one would expect large persistent change configuration exchange rate among countries. the benefit monetary accommodation advance economy create significant way change exchange rates; come instead support domestic aggregate demand country region. moreover, strong growth economy confer beneficial spillover trade partners, policy “beggar-thy-neighbor” rather positive-sum, “enrich-thy-neighbor” actions. again, distinction monetary policy aim domestic objective trade-diverting exchange rate devaluation protectionist measure critical. the former mutually beneficial, latter not. indeed, view prompt group seven central banker finance minister issue statement february agree refrain action focus achieve competitive advantage weaken currency reaffirm fiscal monetary policy would remain orient toward meet domestic objective use domestic instruments.7 among advance economies, mutual benefit monetary ease clear. the case emerge market economy complicated. to first approximation, industrial country concern domestic aggregate demand set level best foster price stability return full employment home. in contrast, many emerge market economy may concern level domestic demand (as need achieve objective employment inflation) consideration well. first, recent decade many country pursue export-led strategy industrialization, may leery expansionary policy advance economy that, else equal, tend cause currency emerge market economy appreciate, restrain exports. second, many emerge market economy financial sector small le develop global standard open foreign investors, may perceive vulnerable asset bubble financial imbalance cause heavy volatile capital inflows, include arise low interest rate advance economies. i agree challenge significant. however, point made. regard effect monetary ease exchange rate exports, i would note trade-weighted real exchange rate emerge market economies, exceptions, change much value shortly intensification financial crisis late 2008. moreover, even expansionary policy advance economy lead significant currency appreciation emerge markets, result drag competitiveness would balance positive effect strong 7 for full text group seven statement, see bank england (2013), “g7 statement,” press release, february 12,

simulation federal reserve board’s econometric model global economy suggest effect roughly offsetting, accommodative monetary policy advance economy appear, net, adverse consequence output export emerge market economies.8 a return solid growth among advance economy ultimately interest advance emerge market economy alike. regard capital flows: it true interest rate differential associate difference national monetary policy promote cross-border capital flow investor seek high returns. but read recent research make skeptical policy difference dominant force behind capital flow emerge market economies; difference growth prospect across country swing investor risk sentiment seem play large role.9 moreover, fact emerge market economy policy depress value currency may create expectation future appreciation induce speculative inflows. of course, heavy capital inflow volatility pose challenge emerge market policymakers, whatever source. policymakers tool address concerns. in recent years, emerge market nation implement macroprudential measure aim strengthen financial system reduce overheat specific sectors, property markets. policymakers also experiment various form capital controls. such control raise concern effectiveness, cost implementation, possible microeconomic distortions. nevertheless, international monetary fund suggest that, carefully circumscribe circumstances, capital control may useful tool.10 in sum, advance industrial economy currently pursue appropriately expansionary policy help support recovery price stability countries. a modern literature great depression demonstrates, policy confer net benefit world economy whole confuse zero- negative-sum policy trade diversion. in fact, simultaneous use several country accommodative policy mutually reinforce benefit all. let end remark i began, pay tribute mervyn king. he leader central bank community extraordinarily difficult period. i wish best next stage career. 8 other work also support find adverse spillovers. for example, one find strong positive spillover bennett t. mccallum (2003), “japanese monetary policy, 1991-2001 (pdf),” federal reserve bank richmond, economic

in this, sixth year financial crisis, situation financial market ease considerably. be we're see prospect end crisis, flash pan? measure central bank make major contribution stabilise financial sector. this sector, however, part whole, stability precondition sustain global economic growth, mean guarantee. the positive mood financial market lead economic indicator raise hope recovery underway. if hope realised, however, structural reform need implemented. the three significant challenge global economy increase resilience financial sector, improve flexibility labour good market (especially europe), consolidate public finance advance economies. progress make three areas. the way ahead, however, still long difficult. due relatively lengthy period weak growth, considerable danger reform fatigue might spread country severely affected. it therefore much important reform well-planned credible, implement consistently, also prudently. there also threat pressure build central bank compensate failure reform monetary policy measures. central bank must resist pressure, order continue focus ensure price stability. governments, hand, embrace deep crisis opportunity implement urgently need structural reforms. only able say, certainty, end financial crisis sight. bi central bankers’ speech 1 malcolm edey: the financial system post-crisis environment remark mr malcolm edey, assistant governor (financial system) reserve bank australia, australian centre financial study (acfs) financial service institute australasia (finsia) leadership luncheon series, melbourne, 22 march 2013. * * * i want talk today financial system change post-crisis environment. in order think that, useful first look back enormous change take place roughly quarter-century period financial deregulation onset global financial crisis (gfc). then i want ask far early trend might expect reassert condition normalise. perhaps obvious aspect early period change financial sector’s relative size. to give summary measures: • the ratio credit gdp increase around 50 per cent mid-1980s around 160 per cent 2007. • over period, total asset bank system rise around 50 around 200 per cent gdp (graph 1). • measure financial market turnover increase dramatically range fronts. to give one example, foreign exchange turnover increase factor 30 nominal dollar term quarter-century, nominal economy expand factor 4½. graph 1 2 bi central bankers’ speech the system also change profoundly way size. one degree openness competition nature competition. the post-campbell reform allow market force work, open system new competitors. the wallis reform follow place regulation bank non-bank intermediary equal footing. we see consequence force cost availability financial service end users. deregulation end artificial ration bank loans, make credit much widely available. another consequence apt forget cost financial intermediation come substantially. in late 1980s average net interest margin major bank 5 percentage points. by middle last decade fall level le half – where, broadly speaking, still today. so finance become cheap widely available (graph 2). graph 2 these force also effect change focal point competition. the ration exist old regulate environment encourage bank compete “whole institution” basis, rather level individual product lines. in effect, bank offer package loan, deposit payment service compete customer level package whole. in situation, wide interest margin use cross-subsidise payment services, customer mobility limit loyalty bank one critical factor obtain access scarce loans. deregulation change model allow innovator compete separately profitable line business. cross-subsidies bank system compete down, help drive reduction net interest margins. it interest note much pre-crisis period, competition among financial intermediary focus mainly lend side business. in effect, intermediary could operate business model assume availability funding, mainly compete market share lend available funds. this one thing change since gfc. with investor much discern risk assessments, bank compete hard deposit fund bi central bankers’ speech 3 markets, change way business. i return point late i conclude. a final area mention briefly round pre-crisis environment growth wealth management sector. fund management (principally superannuation life offices) expand around 30 around 130 per cent gdp 1985 2007, broadly match growth rate see deposit loan sector. and, course, huge growth service relate asset risk management, include security derivative trading. many development counterpart overseas financial systems, surprise sort force work. the majority high-income economy experience high rate credit growth case financial activity expand even fast case australia. in post-crisis environment trend slow down, halt case partly reversed. in australia credit debt measure i cite early broadly stable past five years. internationally, credit contract nominal term markets. there also big change attitude perception financial risk. although confidence global market partly returned, risk appetite clearly was. and certain kind financial activity, particularly wholesale, security derivative market settle much low level pre-crisis period. all raise question new normal might look like financial systems. ha world change forever? to extent expect early causal factor drive financial change reassert themselves? in think this, i find useful categorise causal factor three groups. i see conceptually distinct even though likely interact complex way practice. in first group long-run force drive trend incomes, technology demographics. view abstract, number reason think financial activity might able grow fast general economy sustain periods, even configuration might kind norm. on demand side seem plausible that, people get richer, income spend financial services, include debt servicing, proportionately le need spend necessities. associate this, relative value scarce asset finance debt might expect rise time. and combination increase wealth great longevity society likely generate rise demand service wealth management retirement income sector. on supply side, key point finance information-intensive industry. it key output depend capacity store, analyse transmit information securely. we’re actually good measure real value financial output hence good either measure productivity sector. but would surprise ongoing advance information technology generate significant growth finance industry productivity relative le information-intensive sectors. this process continue long technology go improving. so valid reason think supply demand financial service grow fast nominal income time, thing unchanged. the second set force consider one-off factor make particular quarter century, financial terms, unique. one i already allude to: financial deregulation take place around world mainly late 1970s early 1980s. fundamentally, move situation credit price-controlled quantity-rationed, one credit availability market determined. it probably fair say credit expansion follow shift around world large 4 bi central bankers’ speech protract many expected. nonetheless, nature one-time adjustment, one probably run course. another factor one-off category transition low inflation consequent fall nominal interest rates. in late 1980s, mortgage interest rate australia reach unimaginable 17 per cent. although peak partly cyclical, also partly reflect inflation premium build interest rate structure. a inflation expectation nominal interest rate come 1990s, correspond increase average household’s capacity borrow. a simple illustrative calculation, assume debt service ratio 30 per cent standard 25 year mortgage, household’s borrow capacity would go around two time annual income late 1980s something like four time income decade half later. take combination removal regulatory constraint credit supply, would go long way towards explain quarter-century rise household debt ratios.1 the adjustment new reality seem spread fairly lengthy period time. but again, inflation low stable two decade now, see essentially one-off factor probably run course. my third category force associate cyclical dynamic credit asset prices. the financial sector well-documented capacity engage bout overexpansion, drive self-reinforcing expectation follow period readjustment consolidation. credit cycle nature unpredictable duration, range short sharp long episode span decade more. but think dynamic superimpose longer-term force i’ve already described. even though force might conceptually distinct, practice likely highly interconnected. a financial bubble doesn’t usually come nowhere. typically start well-based reaction genuinely new event, develop self-fulfilling momentum own, often element irresponsibility, dishonesty outright fraud part mix. globally, certainly element bubble-like behaviour year lead gfc. but also pose question whether world financial system overexpanded long timescale, maybe quarter-century scale, react various force i’ve describing. do financial sector aggregate become big relative size real economy? and so, mean period ongoing correction restore balance? it hard definitive things, observation seem relevant: • first all, seem clear least part world financial system overexpand significant margin. to cite extreme cases, total asset irish bank system peak 2009 ratio 9 time country’s annual gdp, figure way outside (and countries’) historical experience. iceland’s ratio peak 7 times. in uk, peak around 5, france 4. all number high standard longer-run experience (graph 3). 1 this point bank make time. see rba (2003), “household debt: what data show”, rba bulletin, march, pp 1–11 elli l (2005), “disinflation dynamic mortgage debt”, bi paper no 22, pp 5–20, available <http://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap22b.pdf>. bi central bankers’ speech 5 graph 3 • behaviour post-crisis period economy consistent period private sector financial consolidation. ratio credit bank asset gdp tend stabilise decline, particularly country previously highest. • the combination regulatory private sector response around world seem likely result reduce financial risk-taking foreseeable future. regulator take much-needed action ensure risk good managed, appetite financial risk household business sector clearly much le was. • in australia bank sector expand relative economy, remain significantly small many others. on rough metric bank asset gdp, australia’s ratio 2, well within international range well euro area, uk japan. so extent generalise financial overhang exists, le likely problem elsewhere. • that said, attitude risk debt accumulation australian household sector clearly changed. save rate up, appetite new debt down, attitude level composition household save become conservative (graph 4). 6 bi central bankers’ speech graph 4 so future? to return three set causal factors: • there reason think longer-run trend income demographic contribute growth financial sector time. • however, much expansion pre-gfc quarter-century drive one-off factors, notably adjustment deregulation low inflation. these adjustment run course. • and, can’t definitive, plausible world financial system overexpanded relative term need period readjustment, though le likely major factor australia elsewhere. the ongoing development financial system post-crisis period depend interplay three factors. on reading, seem clear environment hard general bank system whole grow. while difficult specify might mean numerical terms, return financial sector growth rate consistently high growth nominal gdp seem unlikely foreseeable future. that first conclude comment. my comment concern nature competition. the pre-gfc quarter century unusual period, competition financial intermediation come focus mainly lend side balance sheet. that look aberration, seem enter period significant competition side balance sheet become norm. it might take time get use new reality. but general i see healthy development mean bank great market discipline manage risks. and course, regulator part front well. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter pang: islamic capital money market welcome remark mr peter pang, deputy chief executive, hong kong monetary authority, workshop “islamic capital money markets”, hong kong, 19 march 2013. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 1. it great pleasure welcome islamic finance workshop. we particularly grateful mr. mohd. radzuan, mr. azidy mr. azahari, expert malaysia, fly way hong kong share u knowledge islamic capital money market valuable experience develop critical component islamic finance. i would also like thank mr. najmuddin bank negara malaysia bring malaysian delegation here. two fast develop asset class global market 2. this workshop come opportune time hong kong look develop islamic finance way diversify financial platform enhance capability international financial centre. in view, truly international financial centre, one need develop conducive platform two fast develop asset class global market – islamic financial product rmb-denominated investment assets. 3. the development islamic financial market phenomenal past two decades. the size global islamic finance asset make quantum leap us$150 billion mid-1990s us$1.3 trillion end 2011.1 although investment climate cloud u sub-prime crisis european sovereign debt problem recent years, global sukuk market power ahead. indeed, last year best year global sukuk market record, sukuk issuance grow 60% year-on-year, take outstanding sukuk amount new height us$240 billion.2 accord market estimates, size global islamic finance industry potential increase five-fold current level us$6.5 trillion 2020.3 4. the development rmb-denominated investment product equally impressive. in short space 6 years, size rmb dim sum bond market hong kong grow modest amount 10 billion yuan 2007 237 billion yuan end 2012. offshore rmb financial product also become diversified, expand rmb bond rmb equities, rmb investment funds, rmb a-share exchange-traded fund (etfs) well rmb insurance products. the growth momentum offshore rmb financial market expect pick further, finance investment activity conduct rmb, especially follow introduction mainland authority arrangement inward outward direct investment rmb rmb qualify foreign institutional investor (i.e. rqfii) scheme. 5. hong kong fortunate make good start offshore rmb business. since introduction offshore rmb business 2004, develop wide variety rmb-denominated financial products. in particular, offshore rmb bond market hong kong far large world. we also posse large rmb liquidity pool outside 1 kfh research. 2 zawya. 3 kfh research. 2 bi central bankers’ speech mainland china. a end 2012, aggregate amount rmb customer deposit certificate deposit reach high 720 billion yuan. notwithstanding these, come islamic finance, hong kong relative newcomer would need catch area. legislative exercise promote development sukuk market 6. in develop islamic finance, take step step approach. a first step, current focus put place support legal infrastructure. specifically, hksar government set change tax law hong kong facilitate development sukuk market. in term economic substance, sukuk different conventional bonds. however, since islamic law prohibit payment receipt interest, sukuk often structure use special purpose vehicle multiple transfer underlie assets. this may result additional tax liability hence high issuance cost sukuk compare conventional bond exist tax regime. 7. it therefore necessary refine tax law provide tax framework sukuk comparable one apply conventional bonds. but mean go confer special tax favour islamic finance sector; rather, aim level play field financial instrument similar economic substance give similar tax treatments. 8. on this, i please see amendment bill introduce legislative council early year. the bill adopt prescriptive religion-neutral approach, cover five common type sukuk globally. product meet key feature qualify condition specify bill give tax treatment similar currently afford conventional bonds. this mean sukuk issuer investor alike long subject additional tax stamp duty charge would need pay conventional bonds. so, passage bill positive step forward further development islamic finance hong kong. synergy hong kong malaysia 9. with legal infrastructure place soon, next important step develop islamic financial market here. we definitely lot learn malaysia respect product development market operation. a i see it, hong kong malaysia different edge financial service industry, potential synergy two place develop islamic financial market tremendous. 10. malaysia undoubtedly important lead centre global islamic finance industry accumulate vast experience invaluable expertise past three decades. it develop well-diversified islamic financial market, offer full suite product cover sukuk, islamic equities, islamic funds, islamic etfs, etc. it sukuk market far large world, account 70% global sukuk issuance last year.4 it also put place well-developed financial infrastructure facilitate local overseas market player alike conduct islamic financial transactions. 11. on hand, hong kong international financial centre develop deep highly liquid capital market diverse base investor come around world. more importantly, hong kong’s unique role gateway mainland china lead hub offshore rmb business, hong kong offer ideal platform link islamic rmb finance together develop financial product shariah- 4 zawya. bi central bankers’ speech 3 compliant and, time, denominate rmb. through hong kong’s platform, international investor islamic world easily tap appeal growth story mainland. this especially give fact many investor actively look investment opportunity asia, particularly mainland china, diversify investment portfolios. at time, mainland issuer also make use platform reach increasingly wealthy investor base islamic world. 12. clearly, strong foundation side work together complement other, grow pie big achieve win-win proposition develop islamic finance. for important reason, hkma enter memorandum understand (mou) bank negara malaysia 2009 strengthen

thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 anand sinha: governance bank financial institution address mr anand sinha, deputy governor reserve bank india, deliver behalf, l & t management development centre, lonavla, 19 march 2013. * * * input provide thomas mathew, ms. sindhu pancholy jayakumar yarasi gratefully acknowledged. shri deosthalee senior management l & t. a good evening. i deem privilege address even “governance bank financial institutions”. governance issue engage attention policy makers, intensely aftermath global financial crisis. many instance governance failure come fore contributory factor exacerbate crisis. with lesson learn crisis, framework revisit strengthen governance standards. what governance? what exactly governance? governance, general terms, mean process decision make process decision implement (or implemented),1 involve multiple actors. good governance one accountable, transparent, responsive, equitable inclusive, effective efficient, participatory consensus orient follow rule law. the 1992 report committee financial aspect corporate governance (cadbury report) describe corporate governance system company direct controlled. a per organization economic cooperation development (oecd), corporate governance involves2 “a set relationship company’s management, board, shareholders, stake holders. corporate governance also provide structure objective company set, mean attain objective monitor performance determined. good corporate governance provide proper incentive board management pursue objective interest company shareholder facilitate effective monitoring. the presence effective corporate governance system, within individual company group across economy whole, help provide degree confidence necessary proper function market economy”. the whole gamut corporate governance could consider blend various segments3 namely, regulatory governance, market governance, stake holder governance internal governance. for economy perform well financial system stable, good corporate governance would require across segments. regulatory governance refer control exercise regulator firm statutes, policy regulations. market governance denote use market base control discipline corporate behaviour. while stakeholder governance allude direct indirect control various stakeholder group direct indirect interest corporations, internal governance refer institutional arrangement check balance within corporation. 1 unite nation economic social commission asia pacific, “what good governance” 2 oecd principle corporate governance(2004) 3 sun, willian, stewart, jim pollard, david; “a systemic failure corporate governance: lesson on-going financial crisis” 2 bi central bankers’ speech why corporate governance important financial institutions? while good governance essential entity, deep significance financial institutions. there many compel reasons, are: a. financial institution central economic activity – bank large part non-banking financial system (the shadow bank system) undertake credit intermediation. failure financial institution would thus impede economic growth would cause serious damage system. economy take long time rebound financial crisis business cycle recessions. b. financial institution operate high leverage. a per study bank international settlement (bis) period 1995–2009, compare non-financial institution leverage 3, bank operate leverage 18.3 non-bank financial firm leverage 12.1. high leverage make financial intermediary vulnerable shocks. from systemic perspective, inheren procyclicality financial system lead build high leverage upturn phase economy amplify boom busts. therefore, procyclicality issue need deal financial stability perspective, apparent financial institution must well govern achieve financial stability. c. financial institutions, especially banks, deal people’s save trust customer form cornerstone existence. any breach trust lead loss confidence bind lead run, particular bank others perceive weakness even similar business models. the non bank financial intermediary lose trust lender would able raise resource reasonable cost make hard operate efficiently profitably. all lead snowball effect impair function entire financial system due interconnectedness. good governance ensure customers’ stakeholders’ trust bank non-banking financial intermediaries. d. among financial intermediaries, bank occupy special place due centrality transmission monetary policy function payment settlement systems. they also beneficiary deposit insurance may weaken incentive strong management monitor well monitor stakeholder include depositors. good corporate governance would ensure strong internal control would offset weaken incentive monitoring. a robust stable bank system absolute necessity well function economy. corporate governance – international experience academic literature suggest post 2000, significant development happen corporate governance framework internationally. for e.g., us, corporate scandal include enron world com result failure corporate governance, lead sarbanes–oxley act aim improve accuracy reliability corporate disclosure way enhance oversight role boards, corporate responsibility, certification accuracy financial transaction top management, set standard auditor independence etc. however, widely acknowledge even enhance framework could mitigate weakness play significant role contribute global financial crisis (gfc). there ongoing debate regard manner flaw governance practice play part crisis. while poor implementation blame some, systemic failure corporate governance attribute others cause. oecd uk financial bi central bankers’ speech 3 regulatory council share view shortcoming corporate governance code / principle per se, implementation. governance ethic lack ethic play significant part erosion governance standard institutions. value culture define ethics. ethic principle recommend proper conduct, help distinguish right wrong drive people right thing even one looking. while ethical behaviour minimum requirement deal transaction, become essential financial intermediaries, particularly banks, trust cornerstone. honest prudent behaviour bank financial intermediary integral reputation public confidence system. however, conduct financial institution cause crisis suggest measure endure interaction ethic banking. in fact, financial market entity display significant moral bankruptcy period span pre-crisis, crisis year beyond. some recent high profile event emphatically highlight complete lack ethic financial institutions. london interbank offer rate (libor) rig episode wherein financial institution collude rig libor profit trade give inflate impression creditworthiness shake world. libor one important interest rate use price usd 800 trillion worth financial instrument (reportedly 11 time gdp nation earth). there several episodes. close home too, india, witness high profile case shake public trust financial system. satyam, regard good corporate governance, find deeply involve one india’s big corporate frauds. the 1992 security scam bring nexus banker broke lead massive overhaul financial system india. the unethical practice adopt bank recent past sell inappropriate financial product (exotic derivatives) corporate customer unfair unscrupulous method adopt microfinance institution (mfis) operation recent reminder erosion ethic financial system. cause governance failure a systemic failure corporate governance mean failure whole set regulatory, market, stakeholder internal governance, largely contribute on-going financial crisis.4 a. regulatory governance failure: the regulatory framework pre-crisis period veer towards deregulation liberalization. the chinese wall separate investment bank retail bank bring repeal glass-steagall act 1933 lead proliferation universal banks. while enable institution achieve economy scale scope, also lead transmission risk investment bank retail banking. the exemption regulation otc derivative enable passage commodity future modernisation act 2000 allege encourage excessive trade credit default swap important feature global crisis. other regulatory dispensation permit bank move massive amount asset liability balance sheet structure investment vehicle also fuel 4 sun, willian, stewart, jim pollard, david; “a systemic failure corporate governance: lesson on-going financial crisis” 4 bi central bankers’ speech crisis. further, regulatory gap lead proliferation shadow bank entity also significantly instrumental exacerbate crisis. there lapse supervisory framework also. in run-up crisis, observe supervisor stay sideline intrude sufficiently affair participants. they proactive deal emerge risk adapt change environment. there lack capacity identify, act identification. for example, supervisor could see risk build bank start deal complex product bank start rely excessively short term fund source operations. supervision comprehensive even supervisor find anomaly, take conclusion. b. market governance failure: the prevail dogma prior crisis market always right find balance, leave themselves. there unflinching faith invisible hand markets, despite well know fat tail statistical distribution represent herd behaviour market signify irrationality drive excessive optimism pessimism. however, crisis establish market indeed fallible. a observe joseph e. stiglitz, nobel laureate economics, information imperfect, market often work well information imperfection central finance. c. stakeholder governance failure: the crisis also highlight failure part various stakeholder active involvement corporate governance. d. internal governance failure: it observe lapse internal system control board oversight, managerial competence, compensation policies, audit etc. instrumental exacerbate crisis let briefly touch upon specific internal governance failure financial institution contribute and/or exacerbate crisis. a. complex opaque organizational structures: there massive growth complexity organizational structure pre-crisis period, view take advantage regulatory arbitrage also gap regulations. regulator find difficult look structure enforce regulation. many times, complex structure fell gap regulatory jurisdiction escape regulations. b. inadequate oversight board: board find actively involve formulate risk appetite framework firms. incomplete risk information due gap mi couple inadequate understand risk due lack expertise among directors, hamper effective timely decision making. improper price risk lead suboptimal allocation capital inadequate preparation tail event eventually lead precipitation crisis. c. weakness senior management: senior management fail adopt integrate necessary system identify, manage report risk. the misalignment incentive also result management pursue objective which, times, cross purpose firm. d. proliferation complex products: there significant spurt complexity financial product run-up crisis. abundance cheap liquidity prod participant innovate way deploy fund earn return. complexity opacity lead inadequate understand mispricing risk. the long chain transaction also obfuscate true risk inherent transaction lead false sense comfort. e. flaw remuneration policies: compensation structure focus excessively short term performance incentivised manager take excessive risk order bi central bankers’ speech 5 meet short term objective expense long term sustainability firm. further, framework participant get keep gain loss assure bear society (either explicitly government guarantee implicitly due inevitable governments’ intervention bail due systemic concerns), incentive participant take-up risky activities. equity incentives, put place objective align managers’ incentive shareholders, may also induce manager take excessive risks. f. weak risk management system internal controls: with significant development technology, risk management run crisis become highly quantitative line exact science. model proliferate false assurance capture measure every kind risk. it say economist suffer syndrome physic envy. the model try anticipate future base assumption normality basis past data. in exuberance, quants, however, forget assumption normality correspond reality, particularly, highly stress situations. for example, probability 5-sigma loss give day would mean occurrence happen 14,000 year (assuming 250 trade day year) much long period time elapse since civilisation evolved.5 during crisis wall street journal (2007) report event model predict would happen 10,000 years, happen every day 3 days. further, assumption, rather dogma, basis many models, future could predict basis past data, lead disastrous outcomes. with rapid development technology, increase integration market entry sophisticate players, present future much different past would naïve predict future base past data. g. inadequate emphasis financial literacy consumer protection: while complexity financial product increasing, inadequate attention pay impart financial education public. financial literacy would enable customer make use available product but, importantly, help understand inherent risk product guard financial institution indulge mis-selling unfair practices. international initiative strengthen corporate governance global crisis highlight significance good corporate governance survival well function financial institutions. the senior supervisors’ group’s report “observations risk management practice recent market turbulence” (march 2008) confirm financial institution survive crisis good had, among others, informative responsive risk measurement management report practices. the blend qualitative quantitative analysis provide high level insight consistent communication management evolve conditions, enable firm respond effectively emerge opportunity risks. with lesson draw crisis, policy maker revisit extant corporate governance framework issue guidance view address gap witness strengthen governance framework. the oecd steer group corporate governance, examine governance failures, observe corporate governance weakness remuneration, risk management, board practice exercise shareholder right play important role development global crisis, oecd principle corporate governance issue 2004, nevertheless, provide 5 dowd, kevin hutchinson, martin, “alchemists loss”, time group book 6 bi central bankers’ speech good basis adequately address key concern raise urgent need revisited. the group opine urgent challenge encourage support implementation already agree international national standard include oecd principle corporate governance. basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) revisit 2006 guidance corporate governance bring principle enhance corporate governance (oct 2010). the financial stability board (fsb) has, progress report g20 minister governor (nov 2012) also make recommendation relate corporate governance issue systemically important financial institution (sifis). risk governance there enhance realisation risk governance demand holistic approach risk appreciation start top. a strengthen management information system (mis) support robust information technology platform necessary pre-condition enhance board efficiency oversight decision making. similarly, augment skill set experience level independent director would go long way enhance board capacity. strong mi facilitate risk report board effective comprehensive manner, turn enhance transparency cause inform decision taking. robust information technology system necessary condition support mi framework quality risk information board top management receive depend largely quality robustness information technology systems.6 in addition prescribe risk appetite institution, board also need lay appropriate risk strategy ensure institutionalise throughout organization. this would entail, align risk management process overall business strategy, clearly define role responsibility hierarchy, establish accountability reinforce change communication training. the board senior management oversight must supplement effective leadership chairman chief executive officer (ceo), inform non-executive directors. the board must get much intimately involve risk matter firm understand key risk face business. effective risk governance also demand director aware breadth risk face bank. director add value board financial expertise, aware risk fundamental techniques, able manage dynamic executives. board level risk committee important role play overall risk governance framework. apart monitor firm’s strategic-risk profile on-going basis, committee would also responsible define firm’s overall risk appetite; approve major transaction firm’s risk threshold, and; establish limit structure risk policy use within individual businesses. presence chief risk officer (cro) expect strengthen risk management framework. however, independence cro, necessary stature influence decisions, would critical element ensure effectiveness post risk management process also strategic risk management relate decisions. the cro must report directly ceo board responsible risks, risk management control functions. another important requirement integrate risk business strategy compensation. risk – return risk – need core component performance measure, explicitly factor incentive 6 group thirty, “toward effective governance financial institutions” bi central bankers’ speech 7 compensation schemes. compensation must formally align actual performance, add rigorous risk-based measure scorecards. this would also involve move long vest periods, increase defer compensation. the fragment organisation risk data separate silo slow risk management process hind capability respond new regulatory requirements. the financial crisis push supervisor market player move towards integrate approach risk data bring silo organisation. only integrate data models, process methodology bank achieve high performance term data quality. the risk management system must take account technical limitation risk models, value risk (var). stress test scenario analysis need establish truly effective management tool integrate standardize across business lines, type risk asset classes. financial stability board (fsb)’s thematic review risk governance the financial stability board (fsb) thematic review risk governance7 observe since crisis, national authority take several measure improve regulatory supervisory oversight risk governance financial institution develop strengthen exist regulation guidance, raise supervisory expectation risk management function, engage frequently board management, assess accuracy usefulness information provide board enable effective discharge responsibilities. the evaluation also find many jurisdictions, governance practice advance prescribe national guidance. this, report opined, may motivate firms’ need regain market confidence rather regulatory requirements. the result review support find firm region hard hit financial crisis make progress. however, significant gap relative criterion developed, particularly risk management. the report point difference progress across regions. while firm advance economy adopt desirable risk governance practices, nearly 65 per cent firm reside emerge market develop economy (emdes) meet criterion risk management function. the report note work need do area elevation cro position, establishment effective risk appetite framework (raf), improve chief audit executive (cae)’s access director beyond audit committee, etc. indian scenario corporate governance bank bank regulation india shift prescriptive mode prudential mode 1990s, imply shift balance away regulation towards corporate governance. bank accord great freedom flexibility draw business plan implementation strategy consistent comparative advantage. this freedom necessitate tight governance standard require bank board assume primary responsibility director knowledgeable aware also exercise inform judgement various strategy policy choices. with view strengthen corporate governance, period time, various guideline issue matter 7 8 financial stability board (feb 2013), thematic review risk governance, peer review report 8 bi central bankers’ speech relate role play board, fit proper criterion director banks, bifurcation post chairman manage director (cmd), remuneration etc. recognise ownership bank one individual could detrimental public interest, especially, depositors’ interests, stipulate that, india, bank diversify ownership model. to ensure ownership control bank well diversified, guideline ownership governance private sector bank issue reserve bank february 2005. another important regulatory prescription regard requirement reserve bank’s prior approval acquisition share private sector bank result shareholding 5 per cent total pay capital bank. the importance diversify ownership also underline recent guideline new bank license wherein stipulate non-operative financial hold company (nofhc) set new bank should, initial lock period five years, bring equity capital bank minimum 40% set 15% within 12 years. to ensure “fit proper” status group would set new banks, also stipulate entity / group past record sound credential integrity, financially sound successful track record 10 years. corporate governance non-banking finance company (nbfcs) traditionally, non-banking finance company (nbfcs) india small family run business accept deposit engage mainly activity lending. over years, nbfc sector grow size also term interconnectedness systemic importance. today, even though sector total asset size constitute 12% schedule commercial banks, nbfcs grow big operate conglomerate business interest spread across insurance, broking, mutual fund, real estate etc. keep consideration grow significance nbfcs financial system interconnectedness bank sector strong case strengthen governance framework protect individual institution depositors, also ensure stability entire financial system. further, nbfcs exposure sensitive sector real estate capital market also rely wholesale funding, point requirement robust internal control governance framework ensure stability. during crisis, none shortcoming observe globally gfc manifest significant way indian nbfc sector, temporary crisis confidence emanate affect nbfcs. the lack confidence expose shortcoming fund model consequent problem overall risk management framework nbfcs rely heavily short term wholesale source mutual fund fund long term assets. further, certain shortcoming corporate governance observe section nbfcs viz; microfinance institution (mfi) sector, lead near collapse sector. distort financial incentive short term profit maximization / undue profiteer excessive managerial compensation hallmark gfc lead contributor mfi crisis. the corporate governance issue mfi sector exacerbate “for profit” mfis, dominate control promoter shareholder lead inadequate internal check balance executive decision make conflict interest various levels. other undesirable practice connect lending, excessively generous compensation senior management founders/ director failure internal control lead frauds, precipitate crisis. some mfis also allege chase high growth trajectory expense corporate best practices. bi central bankers’ speech 9 while draw comparison u subprime crisis indian mfi crisis, article title “microfinance industry india: some thoughts” economic political weekly (epw) (october 8, 2011), dr. y.v.reddy, former governor, rbi, observe opaque practices, high salary commission include unethical business leverage prevalent mfis. recognize significance nbfcs overall financial system, measure undertake strengthen regulatory framework term stipulation capital adequacy exposure norm 2006. subsequentlyin2007, guideline corporate governance nbfcs issue reserve bank india. the list nbfcs already require comply provision list agreement security exchange board india (sebi), others govern relevant provision company act, 1956. while framework lay various regulator / company act may appear similar lap areas, differences. company act differentiate financial, non-financial company sebi guideline generally perspective investor protection emphasis disclosure transparency. therefore, rbi prudential regulator nbfcs, additionally lay emphasis risk management framework business practice etc. framework mainly angle depositor / customer protection. reserve bank’s guideline corporate governance applicable nbfcs certain threshold business i.e. certain deposit base asset size. recent development nbfc sector reserve bank recently issue draft guideline corporate governance nbfcs base recommendation work group issue concern nbfc sector (chair: ms. usha thorat). the guideline aim fine tune framework nbfcs align business deal growth size, interconnectedness systemic importance sector. the guideline address issue multiple directorships, continue due diligence process report requirement rbi, self certify “fit proper” criterion disclosure specific nbfcs’ business, disclosure provision coverage ratio, asset

rs. 1000 crore would require prior approval rbi appointment ceo would need comply clause 49 provision (of sebi list agreement) even unlisted. nbfcs asset size rs. 100 crore would require comply disclosure requirement specify clause 49 certain financial indicators. give recent episode mfi sector, corporate governance guideline mfis also revamped. measure aim check undesirable business

borrower two mfis, share credit information credit information bureau, review fair practice code (fpc) etc. a self regulatory organisation (sro) also envisage sector watchdog. while final framework still evolved, role envisage present, inter alia, ensure good governance industry way client protection enforcement power check violation code conduct / regulations. conclusion governance, like regulation, evolve concept continuously fine tune suit dynamic economic business environment. global financial crisis give u 10 bi central bankers’ speech opportunity strengthen regulatory well governance frameworks, highlight gap exacerbate crisis. there interest debate whether much regulation substitute board level governance. while regulation impose outside, corporate governance internal nature self regulation ensure principle rule lay regulation scrupulously adhere to. prior crisis, emphasis increasingly self regulation robust corporate governance regulation could remain largely principle base le prescriptive. however, serious lapse observe governance framework crisis, tilt balance favour rigorous regulation. i view regulation corporate governance complement other. effective

chamber thrift banks, makati city, 20 march 2013. * * * the officer member chamber thrift banks, leadership outgo president, patrick cheng, incoming president, jose teodoro limcaoco, member monetary board, fellow bspers, colleague bank industry government service, lady gentlemen, good morning. the bangko sentral ng pilipinas please take part annual convention. a i begin remark morning, let take opportunity thank outgo officer member board efforts. i please able move forward several fronts, even still full plate reforms. let also congratulate incoming officers. indeed, elect ctb board show confidence peer you. more importantly, accept challenge underscore commitment work great good. a part tradition convention i appreciate row display booth one pas one enter ballroom. stall various company grow partnership industry. to me, variety quality display indicator state thrift bank industry. if year’s display continue tradition, i believe tell u good thing off ctb economy. what horizon? this bring choose theme. “building broad horizon 2013.” horizon interest word. it couple mean evoke several feelings. one mean horizon “apparent intersection earth sky.” we’re come summer months. and i sure, find beach next weeks, discover hard escape temptation stand shoreline, maybe barefoot, fix gaze towards vastness ocean – see ocean sky seem meet horizon. another mean horizon webster dictionary “range one’s perception experience”. put two mean together suggest choose topic year’s convention, actually ask member find way enlarge “what industry know experience able do”. you were, sense, ask member find way enlarge thing point sky earth seem meet. i wish tell even now, journey chosen, industry expect bsp provide operate environment would allow traverse path, way make also mindful impact action – also rest member financial eco-system in. how shall broaden horizon? your goal 2013 clear – broaden industry’s horizon. but would achieve this? in geometry nautical science, i tell practitioner derive mathematical formula calculate distance visible horizon. the exact equation 2 bi central bankers’ speech depend whether adjustment refraction, i.e., distortion due light, do not. but common element equation – distance horizon function height take view. more specifically, visible horizon you, high ground. this natural law quite interest also apply law economics. if i apply law choose goal, i would paraphrase follows. if ctb wish broaden horizon, chamber need raise vantage point. the stage set use 2012 gauge, i believe agree country certainly raise vantage point. when consider markets, environment indeed favourable recent past. the economy expand 6.6 percent 2012 growth match generally stable price inflation average 3.2 percent last year. the high growth-low inflation scenario support robust external position. the country’s balance payment remain surplus due investment growth, business process outsource receipt steady rise remittances. this lead build-up gross international reserves, stand 83.8 billion dollar end-february. this one year’s worth import good services, adequate standard measure adequacy. these positive development heighten investor confidence country expand financial service extend banks. for thrift bank industry, asset rise php 666.17 billion last year (up php 607.43 billion 2011 growth rate 9.7 percent). this back php 529.80 billion deposit match php 449.27 billion loans. give start point 2013, i ask officer member ctb, broaden horizon? i think answer resound yes. we enter 2013 position strength, momentum. the onus you, us, make advantage, bring forward choose objective. opportunity abound – specific direction i’d like spend rest time allot specific suggestion broaden horizon. a quick review industry’s loan portfolio show third industry’s total lend continue towards real estate construction businesses. in addition, lend remain concentrate toward acquisition residential property, improvement take loan commercial purposes, principally bpo sector. these trend make recent approval bsp prudential reference standard contract-to-sell (cts) finance important . furthermore, backdrop low interest rate constant temptation among bank chase high yields, market approach dovetail quite well prudential thrust bsp strengthen credit underwrite practice real estate activities. the bsp yet move formal prescriptive regulation stage. but, appreciate fact market seek define guideline streamline market practice since common standard recognize date. in context year’s convention theme, market approach see industry’s way broaden horizon, financial stability specifically mind. a already take step forward mortgage finance, perhaps chamber bi central bankers’ speech 3 likewise consider similar standard auto loan order ensure bank don’t end finance “lemons”. we would also like see chamber actively contribute towards equivalent effort credit card receivables mode consumer financing. business cycle come go, therefore important rule game squarely place, market inflection point cause instability market. a market opportunity expand, need also work together maintain strong credit discipline avoid imprudent lend investments. lady gentlemen. we economy 96 million filipino spread 7,101 islands. it stand reason consumer-related financing, bread butter, major factor economy. hence, bsp’s push improve credit underwrite standard consumer loans. but parallel this, believe thrift bank also actively participate culture practice financial education consumer protection. these fancy buzz words. in fact, bsp, take twin advocacy seriously. through economic financial learn center (eflcs) head office 21 regional office branches, undertake outreach raise awareness financial consumer make inform save investment choices. the bsp partner chamber program look forward engage chamber even more. we would also like see individual member chamber embark literacy programs. a complement, create specialize department bsp call financial consumer affair group (fcag). it set clear hub complaint redress mechanism clearly victimize fault suffer add penalty delay attention. furthermore, bsp early stage formalize specific standard consumer protection, include bank handle consumer complaints. this move aim elevate consumer protection stature core bank function, simply ancillary advocacy. let leave world real estate consumer finance. and turn another sector chamber well-equipped support. here i mean world micro, small medium enterprises. the philippine traditionally msme market. and raise national economic vantage point take advantage momentum come 2013, thrift bank need consider lend economic segment. i say msmes provide great employment opportunities. a healthy msme sector help ensure economic growth broad-based inclusive. thrift banks, however, must lend term nominal amounts. the challenge industry really ensure lend continuously create opportunities. in way, msmes assure viability, regardless mandate credit programs. final think friends, want convention discussion broaden horizon, horizon. in try look ahead, i take u scenic route recent past. the number tell u encourage story growth consistency economic financial stability. however, paradox financial stability may weak believe strong position. complacency often set positive news continuous reinforce encourage market parameters. if fall trap complacency, risk lose focus. for thrift bank industry, growth trajectory many anticipate suggest even good time ahead. it therefore collective interest, wish truly broaden horizon, agree common vision thrift bank definitive role play. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in remarks, i suggest specific action point may consider order accomplish that, time broaden horizon. i challenge industry 1) improve credit underwrite standard real estate consumer loan raise vantage point look process lens financial stability, 2) interact client raise vantage point enhance practice heart consumer protection financial education, 3) increase lend msmes raise vantage point lend mind create great value. but much done. a old board take place ctb lore, new board helm guide industry forward. it never easy task move forward rest assure bangko sentral ng pilipinas take journey together broad horizons. thank much good day you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yaseen anwar: mobile bank pakistan speech mr yaseen anwar, governor state bank pakistan, 6th international conference “mobile bank pakistan”, karachi, 14 march 2013. * * * good morning lady gentleman i indeed delight today conference mobile banking. i would like congratulate organizer arrange important conference, become annual event showcase developments, measure progress make mobile bank country. through annual conferences, u identify various challenge find new solutions, thus transform branchless bank vibrant innovative industry pakistan. let first briefly talk significance mobile commerce move mobile banking, role promote financial inclusion, responsibility strengthen mobile bank pakistan. mobile commerce generally characterize variety business partnership often involve large number organizations, content provider financial institution mobile network operators. after successful application mobile commerce alternative channel delivery payment service develop countries, concept also take root develop countries. the usage innovative unconventional channel dominate conventional mean business communication, evidence high mobile phone subscription witness pakistan. the number mobile phone subscriber reach 120 million. turn use mobile technology promote financial access, emerge consensus amongst policy maker around world improve access financial service poor people, support safe sound spread new mode financial service delivery capable reach poor. in pakistan, development branchless bank far marvelous, leave nobody doubt potential mobile phone bank game-changer banking, m-commerce, financial inclusion. broadly describe recent developments, witness transformation customers’ need behaviors, increase competition, technological innovation, new business models, regulatory proportionality. owe developments, international development agency medium highlight pakistan market institutional environment branchless banking. in article month back, the financial time count branchless bank microfinance initiative pakistan among “hidden force resilience offer best hope country’s future”. elaborate further, article highlight pakistan “being perpetual motion grassroots ceaseless creativity people find affordable solution basic needs”. regulatory approach play fundamental role development branchless banking. the issuance branchless bank regulation 2008 outcome sbp’s vision strategy develop road map financial inclusion use mobile phone banking. with regulations, sbp enable diverse set player include banks, microfinance banks, mobile network operator (mnos), retailers, technology firm develop partnership business models, safeguard stability bank payment system, interest customers. in accordance objectives, sbp allow bank-led model undertake branchless banking. at time, many think “restrictive” approach, would work out. they prove wrong subsequent phenomenal growth branchless bank pakistan. a 2 bi central bankers’ speech result market developments, sbp’s regulatory approach experience cite example country follow. accord recent cgap publication, “pakistan serf example public private institution together move country towards digital financially inclusive system”. the report note “government public actor create enable environment provide seed funding, private actor develop infrastructure, service long-term business case”. since issuance branchless bank regulation 2008, several branchless bank model deployed. ubl’s omni tame bank’s easypaisa already gain substantial grind establish market leaders. two new service (mobicash timepey) launch two run live pilots. moreover, four mobile network operator partnership large bank already launch branchless bank service final stage launching. a result, branchless bank current growth trajectory expect get steep year ahead. with entrance new strong players, branchless bank already see acceleration. the number agent network service branchless bank customer reach 42, 000. therefore, basic financial service access remote part country agents. a total 194 million transaction carry worth 813 billion rupees. more 2 million m-wallets open till date, number improve significantly. along tremendous growth branchless bank sector, infrastructure payment system branch network also show increase growth trend. the atm network increase 6,232 whereas branch network reach 11,600. 94 percent branch real time on-line. similarly, number plastic card increase 20 million number po machine increase 34,000 units. this significant achievement, also demonstrate opportunity bring benefit infrastructure million unbanked population. branchless bank also prove effective instrument channelize government person (g2p) payment try time like serve internally displace person (idps), devastate flood last two years. the benazir income support programme beneficiary also serve effectively mechanism. in come days, channel expect continue play important role towards promotion financial inclusion management government person (g2p) program like salary disbursements, pensions, bisp, watan cards, pakistan card tax collection services, etc. the exist branchless bank deployment cater need 10 million potential beneficiary g2p payment pakistan. branchless bank go dominate retail bank landscape long-term. whilst seek encourage introduction innovative instrument payments, also need ensure high level standard maintain safety, security protection consumers’ interests. the central policy objective sbp ensure safety, soundness efficiency bank system, protect interest consumers. since branchless bank become vital component national payment grid, prudent stakeholder ensure appropriate measure place mitigate inherent risk associate like access un-authorized persons/ criminal hackers, money launderer, terrorist financier etc. this achieve technology robust secured, agent comprehensively train effectively monitor banks. in regard, importance comprehensive agent development framework cannot ignored. i sure bank would simply jump bandwagon without sufficient agent development mechanism include hiring, on-going train monitoring. bi central bankers’ speech 3 build public confidence innovative payment solution critical. a single failure branchless bank deployment erode public’s confidence system turn may jeopardize whole sector. be fully cognizant risk factor involve unconventional mode banking, sbp proactively monitor development associate risk system entity level order take appropriate corrective measure timely manner. we must acknowledge branchless bank gain critical mass short period time. i believe market start shift transaction first generational service (person-to-person/bills payments) second generational service (account-to-account inter-bank transfer). the player need

bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: total impact – regulation crisis management change world’s financial landscape speech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, frankfurt finance summit, frankfurt, 19 march 2013. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman i delight conclude year’s frankfurt finance summit. for third year row, event provide excellent platform exchange view high-level expert politics, academia, well financial official sector discus financial market issue major current importance. today’s conference ask total impact regulation crisis management financial landscape. the keynote speaker panellist give wide-ranging and, cases, diverge answer question. i please conclude year’s summit offer view particular aspect issue discuss today. 2. future european monetary union let start topic first panel morning: future european monetary union. the crisis highlight shortcoming union’s institutional framework. let remind three serious flaws. first, deficit rule stability growth pact circumvent member states, deliberately bent. second, member states’ borrow effectively curb financial market fail exert discipline effect public budgets. third, contagion effect transmit via member states’ financial system largely underestimated. the introduction single currency lead great integration european financial markets. the highly integrate market increase probability contagion effect occur via member states’ financial systems. hence, amplify exist close link risk stem country’s public finance state bank system. these flaw major factor emergence sovereign debt crisis fact make good case strengthen institutional framework monetary union. i welcome measure initiated. the reform stability growth pact agreement fiscal compact major step towards sound budgetary policies. with agreement european bank union, make progress one important specific area. a bank union help strengthen financial stability loosen nexus bank sovereigns. a european bank supervisor would benefit ability make cross-border comparisons, instance. such body able monitor build-up excessive risk pinpoint easily early stage. a single supervisory mechanism also overcome national bias supervisors. but single supervisory mechanism sufficient. to shield bank weak public finances, must accompany sound regulatory underpinning. such regulation include upper limit lend government appropriate capital back sovereign bonds. finally, bank union comprise european resolution 2 bi central bankers’ speech recovery mechanism ensure bank creditor – taxpayer – first line bear loss bank’s failure. such comprehensive bank union important element new institutional framework monetary union. it bring significant change bank stakeholders, also regulator supervisor function transfer national european level. 3. financial sector reform change also make financial sector reforms. the financial crisis highlight weakness financial sector regulation. a response this, g20 head state government set train comprehensive reform agenda november 2008. in meantime, pass number major milestone agenda. but make international financial system resilient robust be, still long way go. one press issue implementation basel iii. what worry doubt implementation voice respect country home global financial centre systemically important institutions. i consider utmost importance g20 country live self-commitment lead example. the initial implementation timeline modify eu us. we need make sure delay lead water measure agree upon internationally. strict bank regulation might set incentive move business le regulate entities. the regulation shadow bank system therefore another press issue. regular monitor exercise help u gain good understand kind scale business conduct outside regulate bank system. but actor activity still remain largely unregulated. i consider particularly important deliver final set integrate recommendation regulate shadow bank system g20 september. and absolutely crucial finally solve too-big-to-fail problem. however, keep mind term precise. in many cases, institution big actually important fail. recent example nationalisation repeat bail-outs institution netherlands france show that, ultimately, still taxpayer risk bank trouble. we need remove implicit government subsidy systemically important institution subject ultimate sanction market. it must possible force bank exit market without destabilise financial system. to make threat credible, restore constitutive element function market economy: principle liability. the one profit must also one bear losses. i consider implementation internationally agree framework deal systemically important financial institution top priority. similarly, “too big fail” issue – time true sense word – also occur bank sector large relation economy whole. the case iceland, ireland cyprus good example this. the bank system cyprus currently 7 time size national gdp. by way comparison, average bank system monetary union 3.5 time size national gdp. this problem also fuel cypriot business model provide low-tax environment. if bank sector large, national taxpayer unable bear costs. consequently, european solidarity require resolve problems. this comparable case systemically important banks, depend support taxpayer bank get difficulties. this problem bank sector “too big fail” also need address one way another. this could achieve downsize bank sector, agree meet euro group. bi central bankers’ speech 3 but let get back current reform initiatives. they need fully consistently implement enhance resiliency financial sector. to ensure consistency, need focus even systemic aspect financial regulation. regulatory measure must build upon interlock set consistent incentives. otherwise, run risk individual measure conflict other. such lack consistency might lessen desire effect new regulation even negate entirely. impact study important tool context. to gauge effect new regulation, study accompany major reform projects. to avoid regulatory arbitrage, must take account cross-border effect regulation. the global financial system need global rules. accordingly, need ensure internationally agree measure transpose national law regulation timely consistent manner. i strongly support in-depth implementation monitor financial stability board international standard-setting body essential tool maintain implementation pressure. finally, crisis remind u contain systemic risk vital safeguard financial stability. to mitigate prevent systemic risks, macroprudential policy framework implement many countries, include germany. since begin year, german financial stability act force. a financial stability commission comprise representative bundesbank, federal financial supervisory authority german finance ministry established. the commission charge design consistent macroprudential policy hold first meet yesterday. the institutional set-up fairly advanced. now, need deepen understand effect macroprudential tool operationalise use. 4. change financial landscape although financial sector reform yet complete, already possible see impact new regulation financial landscape. some bank fall list global systemically important bank simplify structure, downsize de-risked operations. this also include german bank. several bank de-emphasise high-profile risky capital market business benefit employee shareholder society whole. the modify business model ultimately result resilient diversify sector sustainable risk-return profile. further change banks’ business model bring structural measures. concern institutions’ business conduct build political case measures, include ring-fencing prohibition certain activities. correspond recommendation make paul volcker, john vickers erkki liikanen us, uk, eu respectively. while proposal differ important details, share general idea. deposit-taking credit institution shield risk speculative proprietary trade high-risk lending. such separation business line play part make financial system stable resilient. but silver bullet. ultimately, leave bank board management decide business model best future. i appreciate german legislative proposal introduce ring-fence leaf leeway regard. finally, evidence corporate culture bank changing. risk management, example, gain prominent role organisational structure banks. effort strengthen risk governance undertake well, improvement necessary. the manipulation benchmark interest rate trader case point. withhold claw back variable part remuneration package employee involve fraudulent activity first step. in future, i expect see change institution towards promotion sound risk cultures. bi central bankers’ speech 1 tharman shanmugaratnam: key issue asian financial market keynote address mr tharman shanmugaratnam, chairman monetary authority singapore, aci (the financial market association) 52nd world congress, singapore, 15 march 2013. * * * mr. manfred wiebogen, aci global president distinguish guests, lady gentleman 1. i delight today you. 2. the last time singapore host aci congress back 2001. in fact, 9/11. the world different place. asia different today. the wind asian crisis late 90 still fresh. investor confidence various country region uneven. and asian capital market large infancy. the new financial landscape 3. we new phase global finance. global finance deleveraging, great credit bubble begin decade ago come end 2007. but deleveraging still way go, year go, overall level leverage relative economic activity get back sustainable level. 4. the pace deleveraging moderate far central banks, take onto balance sheet unprecedented level public private sector debt. their action reduce risk catastrophe. but also mean long way yet go reduce debt return sustainable growth. 5. we also see important shift structure global finance, besides gradual contraction global liquidity. it early say five year now, broad brush-strokes new landscape global finance already u likely stay: • the return equity global bank fallen, return pre-crisis levels, give strict capital liquidity rules. • deposit become important source bank funding. • bank certain major jurisdiction retreat global markets, worryingly, may stay retreat time. • the securitised debt market recover, le leverage underpin them, hopefully great risk transparency. • in derivative markets, great standardisation products, much great reliance common market infrastructure – trading, clear report trades. high volume, low-margin platform likely gain competitiveness. • wealth management remain growth industry, especially asia, pool wealth grow rapidly need diversification remain great. • and outside intermediate finance, company seek new way raise funds, include private placements. 6. will mean safe financial world? maybe. that depend whether persist see regulatory reform begin year ago. it depend 2 bi central bankers’ speech whether keep sensible balance regulation – include over-doing bank regulation under-doing oversight shadow banking. it also depend whether stay intensely alert risk future, include especially risk yet see know, rather focus last battle prevent last crisis recurring. 7. what global capital flows? there see shifts, global finance respond two-track world economic growth. the prospect sub-par growth advance economy number years, together central bank action keep interest rate low, lead become furious search yield. pension fund insurance fund need good yield badly, put monies emerge market risk assets. 8. this likely cyclical trend. we see secular shift asset towards emerge markets. advance country fund fact remain significantly underweighted emerge market assets, gradually correct this. at time, sovereign debt rat raise several emerge economies, asia especially1, time number advance economies2 see rat lowered. asia certainly free risks, much work ahead preserve improve sovereign ratings. but one assume recent rebalancing risk assessment vis-à-vis advance economy temporary. 9 what continue shift global fund also means, however, critical need add depth breadth asian financial markets. it possible absorb great share global save without develop depth breadth markets, robust market infrastructure. otherwise, global asian capital flow within region lead recurrent bubbles, whether equities, property market currencies, rather find way productive investment asia’s economies. 10. asia’s financial market grow significantly past decade. but capital markets, especially bond securitised debts, remain small relation asia’s gdp. further, region’s financial market still relatively small fragmented. 11. there virtue, great potential develop asian financial market enable play strong role promote balance sustainable growth. 12. we push ahead reform two level develop financial markets. gradual progressive financial liberalisation bring liquid broad domestic financial markets. it also help spur domestic demand households, provide small enterprise good access capital several asian economies. secondly, regional level, inject great momentum improve cross-border market access harmonise rule standards. key theme development asia’s financial market 13. let touch three theme influence development asia’s financial market decade ahead: i. firstly, change otc derivative market result global reforms; ii. secondly, harness technology transform asia’s financial infrastructure; iii. thirdly, increase international role rmb. 1 for example, south korea, indonesia, thailand philippines. 2 namely us, japan, france, peripheral europe. bi central bankers’ speech 3 i. structural shift otc derivative market result global reform 14. first, structural shift global otc derivative markets. most familiar change come place, steps, result global reform – standardise products, robust market infrastructure: central counterparties clearing, trade repository reporting, swap execution facility trade appropriate. the global reform process shift rulemaking implementation. 15. we already see shift asia’s otc derivative markets. the new market infrastructure expect provide great transparency allow risk manage effectively among market participants. market practice redefined, need report clear select otc derivative trade within one jurisdictions. 16. however, also see proliferation central counterparties (ccps) trade repository set asia. while provide choice asian market participants, may also increase risk lead high costs. 17. regulator need comprehensive view risk cross-border, interconnect market. have multiple ccps trade repository region may risk fragmentation, may hamper monitor systemic risk regulator may see segment market. market participant also face additional cost ccps trade repository lack economy scale. 18. asian regulator therefore need work closely together enable infrastructural entity offer service across different jurisdictions. for example, infrastructure dtcc global trade repository asiaclear ccp singapore offer prospect effective surveillance regional regulator economy scale. we continue ensure market infrastructure operate transparent accessible way need regional regulator industry meet clear robust guidelines. 19. at global level too, real benefit regulator ensure inter-operability market infrastructure allow effective risk monitoring. however, inter-operability require time effort, risk management practice margin eligibility standard harmonise across ccps different jurisdictions. 20. a asia’s infrastructure still early stage development, opportunity harmonise practice make change need respond emerge global regulatory reforms. it hearten note asian regulator work closely otc derivative regulations. a good example joint letter singapore, hong kong australia u cftc, express concern extra-territorial application u rules. ii. harness technology transform asia’s financial infrastructure game-changing fashion 21. regulator everywhere confront highly connect global markets. collect manage information core competence itself, effective surveillance financial markets. similarly, market participant make great use technology risk management – perform complex portfolio valuation mitigate risk intra-day margining ccps, often across global book multiple time zone jurisdictions. move collateral across market swiftly efficiently also core competence. 22. besides risk management, technology useful develop liquidity asian markets. it bring great price efficiency transparency, see u eu financial market trade move electronic platforms. 23. in asia, room financial market embrace great “electronification” trading, notwithstanding small markets. to illustrate, estimate 80% trade 4 bi central bankers’ speech execute electronic platform develop country fx markets, whereas 85% fx trade asia still execute voice. a reduction transaction cost promote great liquidity asian asset classes, broaden participation investor include retail traders. iii. grow regional international role rmb 24. let go third theme i want talk about, rmb internationalisation, shape asia’s financial market development. 25. the status quo last. currently, 0.6% global payment settle rmb, vastly china’s share global trade (10%) investment flows. there clearly room growth. 26. in long run, envisage china deep liquid capital markets, largely liberalise capital account, rmb market potentially play transformational role asian finance. for now, even limit convertibility, considerable potential great use rmb. the economic fundamental drive this. besides china’s grow share global trade, rapidly grow trade china rest asian region, especially asean. further, china’s foreign direct investment expand strongly, especially asian markets. outbound foreign direct investment (fdi) china increase almost seven-fold last seven year (to us$77 billion 20123), expect expand come decade. a grow part fdi expect rmb-denominated, contribute great offshore use rmb. 27. the overseas expansion chinese corporates reinforce grow presence mainland chinese bank grow regional international presence. in singapore, extend qualify full bank (qfb) privilege bank china icbc part china-singapore fta. both bank grow singapore operation southeast asian hubs. we also see interest chinese financial institutions. 28. the re-denomination china’s trade flow rmb allow asian corporate financial institution effectively manage exposure china. while usd would remain integral global settlement currency, rmb likely increasingly use trade denomination contract pricing. 29. a see great acceptance use rmb trade settlement currency, also important implication interaction china asia’s financial markets, indeed global financial markets. 30. for one, critical facilitate development single fungible offshore rmb market, market grow multiple jurisdictions. (currently, industry designate different currency codes, cnh cnt, reflect exist market frictions.) regulator market participant work together avoid fragment liquidity across markets, promote efficiency offshore rmb market. 31. in addition, china plan launch international payment system, know cips, 2014. the development single centralise cross-border rmb payment infrastructure also augur well market efficiency standardise practice rmb payment across region. 3 cnbc, 17 jan 2013. “china’s outbound investment leap record high december”. bi central bankers’ speech 5 singapore’s role offshore rmb market 32. a international trade financial centre, singapore seek support growth resilient offshore rmb market asian region by: i. build rmb liquidity; ii. enhance access rmb fund investment purposes; iii. integrate offshore rmb exist asian local currency markets. 33. firstly, singapore leverage strength key wholesale fund centre increase liquidity circulation rmb asia. we already see good growth rmb deposits, non-bank interbank. we also one large centre rmb payment outside hong kong. a major regional fund centre, singapore traditionally support liquidity asian market partner china promote sustainable offshore use rmb. 34. in february year, icbc singapore appoint people’s bank china (pbc) rmb clear bank singapore. the rmb clear bank important channel rmb liquidity circulate china singapore. 35. in addition, pbc ma together announce expand currency swap facility last friday. this see double size swap facility rmb150 rmb300 billion. the scope currency swap facility also expand allow ma provide rmb liquidity bank singapore, needed. this backstop facility strengthen confidence singapore’s offshore rmb market, encourage financial institutions, corporates, investor step forward participate rmb market via singapore. 36. secondly, strong rmb pool, singapore provide enhance access rmb fund corporates investors. singapore major source fdi china serf asia-pacific headquarter many multinational company (mncs) asian corporates operation china. we also serve regional treasury centre large base chinese corporates. 37. with new rmb clear arrangements, expect financial institution base singapore reach local regional corporate investor encourage great participation offshore rmb market. 38 thirdly, singapore support integration offshore rmb asian local currency market act test-bed new rmb products. the development wide range rmb product healthy. it create additional way corporates redeploy rmb fund offshore markets, provide additional product investment. 39. the financial industry singapore good expertise develop fx derivative instruments, several emerge asian fx team base here. it well equip develop customise offshore rmb capital market instruments, especially asian market participants. for instance, bank singapore explore encourage offshore rmb bond issuance singapore long maturity tenor different issuer profiles. conclusion 40. let wrap briefly. global deleveraging accompany continue inflow fund asia’s emerge market economies. this shift pose risk well-managed, also opportunity. the next phase development asia’s financial market therefore critical. we develop great breadth breadth asian markets, save flow translate sustainable economic growth rather recurrent bubble asset markets. 41. thank i wish successful conference. bi central bankers’ speech 1 philip lowe: internal balance, structural change monetary policy address mr philip lowe, deputy governor reserve bank australia, australian industry group 13th annual economics forum, sydney, 19 march 2013. * * * i would like thank david orsmond valuable assistance preparation talk. it pleasure participate australian industry group’s annual economics forum. this fourth time i participate forum, speak 2010, 2011, 2012 2013. over period, australian economy undergo significant adjustment. my central message today that, overall, adjustment proceed pretty well, particularly light extraordinary development occur global economy years. this message mean downplay disruptive sometimes painful effect change take place. at reserve bank, spend much time try understand stress strain face part economy result structural change. but also spend time try understand benefit come change, include increase average live standard high productivity. from overall perspective, important lose sight achieve australia. we manage maintain fair degree internal balance period considerable structural change, large shift world relative prices, major boom investment financial crisis many north atlantic economies. our economic performance much good many country remain well place benefit shift economic weight towards emerge market economies, particularly asia. while i understand many company face challenges, lose sight big picture – picture i suspect many country wish shared. internal balance structural change i would like begin morning briefly summarise broad economic outcome australia since i first speak forum march 2010. since time, output australian economy increase 9 per cent. the number people job rise half million. the unemployment rate today, 5.4 per cent, exactly three year ago. and underlie inflation average 2½ per cent period, midpoint medium-term inflation target. so three year see growth close trend, stable relatively low unemployment rate inflation target. by standard countries, represent good outcome high degree internal balance. remarkably, achieve balance despite experience big boom business investment large rise term trade hundred year (graph 1). in past, much small investment term trade boom cause outbreak inflation emergence imbalance economy. on occasion happened. the investment boom lead large increase current account deficit. there explosion credit. increase asset price generally contained. and average level interest rate long-term average, despite significant additional demand generate record level investment term trade. 2 bi central bankers’ speech graph 1 there number factor important understand domestic internal balance maintained, generally low interest rates, despite large shock experience australian economy. this morning, i would like focus two these. the first flexible exchange rate. the high level investment commodity price associate high value australian dollar. this clearly cause difficulty part economy, include manufacturing, tourism education sectors. but overall macroeconomic perspective, appreciation exchange rate play important stabilise role. have experience sizeable appreciation recent years, highly likely economy would overheat would substantially high inflation substantially high interest rates. this would interest community large or, i might add, interest sector currently adversely affect high exchange rate. it also worth add that, case, unlikely would avoid substantial real exchange rate appreciation, come costly route high inflation. this, course, mean that, every point time, exchange rate ideal rate domestic balance perspective. we forget exchange rate relative price two countries’ moneys. this mean determine happen domestically happen abroad. this obvious recent years, accommodative monetary condition many develop economy tend put downward pressure value currencies, include relative australian dollar. a say number times, reserve bank respond development low cash rate. it also worth repeat low cash rate direct intention achieve low exchange rate, rather intention offset contractionary effect australian economy high value australian dollar. over recent times, extensive discussion australian business confirm adjust high value currency. when i speak forum 2010 2011 bi central bankers’ speech 3 sense many business hop high exchange rate temporary development, would pass, business model wouldn’t change much. today, i quite different sense. nowadays, great recognition high exchange rate likely quite persistent firms, include manufacture sector, adjust this. many look improve internal process address inefficiencies. they focus product value add high quality workforce strategic advantage. we hear business right across country look improvement many find them. this adjustment business process model often painful. but fact occur one reason reserve bank tentatively optimistic time productivity growth would pick-up low rate experience much previous decade. we see tentative evidence aggregate productivity data (graph 2). while data tend volatile year year subject sizeable revisions, productivity growth 2012 good quite time. of course, cannot sure continue, structural change occur mean reasonable prospect sustain lift productivity growth. graph 2 we also see evidence adjustment detail industry data, include manufacture sector. while little net growth either aggregate output export manufacture sector years, part industry do quite well. output machinery equipment metal trend high recent years, export specialise mining-related machinery increased, export category (graph 3). many area australia comparative advantage value add high. it focus comparative advantage best build strong successful manufacture sector, time live high exchange rate. 4 bi central bankers’ speech graph 3 i would like turn second broad factor help maintain domestic balance once-in-a-century investment boom. and increase household saving. since mid 2000s, household sector net save ratio rise around zero around 10 per cent (graph 4). in today’s money represent additional $90 billion saved, spent, household year. graph 4 now i know increase household save universally welcome retail sector. it cause difficulty businesses, include base business model continuation early trends. but consider economy might look past year household spend extra $90 billion bi central bankers’ speech 5 year. it likely would significant overheating. the exchange rate would higher. there would borrow rest world. and inflation interest rate would higher. i suggest development would warmly welcome community. so, somewhat ironically, two factor create difficult challenge many business recent year – high exchange rate increase household save – factor critical australia’s good macroeconomic performance. importantly, factor help australia digest huge investment boom without generate substantial imbalance economy. at time, factor prompt significant structural change which, difficult, critical achieve high overall productivity high live standards. there clearly lot change go australian economy moment. how view change depend critically upon stand. however, matter one’s perspective, lose sight fact maintain overall macro balance period change significant achievement. and achievement benefit entire community. the contribution monetary policy so far i discuss structural factors, monetary policy also play role help maintain overall internal balance. in particular, australia’s credible medium-term inflation target framework serve u well period change. it important though point monetary policy cannot make various global factor drive economy go away. monetary policy cannot, attempt to, prevent structural change occurring. what deal best hand global economy deal us. we help ensure aggregate demand supply remain broad balance, firm make employment, investment production decision reasonable confidence health overall economy. importantly, ensure inflation remain low stable uncertainty overall level price add list thing community worry about. since november 2011, board reserve bank low cash rate six times, cumulative 1¾ percentage points. these reduction bring cash rate 3 per cent, equal low level record. lend rate also come substantially, although number still early low give general rise bank fund cost occur since global financial crisis. recently, discussion whether low rate actually working. this type discussion surprise give lag monetary policy change full effect felt economy. it matter simply change interest rate today see immediate response tomorrow. another complication environment interest rate adjust one interest rate phase next. a result, exact way movement interest rate transmit economy change time. all mean that, always, need monitor thing closely. at moment though, available evidence suggest low interest rate work broadly expected. in general, initial response loosen monetary policy would expect include strong asset prices, improve condition house market, lift consumer confidence low exchange rate. much appear occurring. nationwide measure house price increase around 4 per cent since mid last year, decline around 6 bi central bankers’ speech 18 months. home lend approval auction clearance rate risen. equity price 20 per cent since middle last year. and level consumer confidence well long-run average level (graph 5). despite one often hears, household appear feel good finance well australia’s medium-term prospects. graph 5 the one notable exception expect response follow substantial ease monetary policy little movement exchange rate. however, reflect global factor i talk earlier, reserve bank attempt calibrate set monetary policy take account this. now, monetary transmission mechanism work broadly past, improvement consumer sentiment high asset price fee through, time, high spend households. there signs, albeit still tentative, begin occur. ab data bank’s liaison suggest slightly firm retail spend recent month second part last year, though condition remain mix across industry. there also sign pick-up forward indicator new dwell construction across many area country. in addition, number labour market indicators, soften last year, slightly firm tone late. another critical element monetary transmission process pick-up private business investment. this often last link chain, typically follow increase confidence high spending. give nature investment boom currently experiencing, non-mining investment look pick-up occur. a mine investment inevitably peak gradually declines, critical question outlook strength expect pick-up non-mining investment. we cannot know answer question yet. what know part transmission mechanism appear work broadly line expectation tentative sign lift investment intention outside resource sector. the noteworthy capital expenditure data publish ab week back, show firm expect increase spend non-mining construction machinery equipment investment next financial year. whether increase sufficient offset expect low level mine investment something watch carefully month ahead. bi central bankers’ speech 7 so let conclude restate main message i start – is, australian economy adjust pretty well large shock global economy recent years. we able maintain high degree internal balance, time accommodate significant change structure economy. business right across spectrum, include manufacture sector, adjust new realities. this adjustment often difficult, hold prospect high productivity high live standards. monetary policy play important support role adjustment keep inflation low stable reserve bank australia commit continue play role. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 takahide kiuchi: recent development economic activity price future monetary policy speech mr takahide kiuchi, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, kanagawa, 28 february 2013. * * * i. current situation overseas economy prospect moderate recovery a. ease tension global financial market i would like start speech look overseas economies. development global financial market continue require vigilance, especially term european debt problem fiscal problem unite states. nevertheless, tension financial market ease significantly since around autumn 2012, evidence repurchase risk asset currency emerge economy stock sell advance economies’ government bond yen, purchase safe currency. three thing seem work background developments. first, europe unite states, decline occur tail risk – risk low probability materialization devastate impact materialize. this reflect fact europe possibility disintegration euro fall significantly, support (1) approval new disbursement financial assistance greece, (2) progress achieve fiscal consolidation economic structural reform peripheral european country portugal spain, (3) introduction safety valve european stability mechanism (esm). in addition, begin 2013 unite state avoid “fiscal cliff,” state expiration large-scale tax cut substantial fiscal spend cut threaten occur simultaneously. second, investors’ confidence return due expectation regard policy measures, central bank advance economy unite state europe well japan conduct aggressive monetary easing. third, expectation grow global economy pick up, u.s. chinese economy firm since autumn 2012. b. gradual pick-up overseas economy deceleration phase while overseas economy remain deceleration phase whole, sign pick-up observed. the u.s. economy moderate recovery trend. business sentiment cautious due concern fiscal cliff improve somewhat, business fix investment show sign pick-up. in household sector, firmness house investment car purchase become pronounce partly due effect decline long-term interest rates. a outlook, recovery trend u.s. economy likely gradually strengthen latter half 2013, effect expiration tax cut wane uncertainty diminish regard fiscal spend cut debt ceiling problem. economic activity euro area remain weak. from latter half 2013, however, economic activity likely gradually recover particularly core country germany france. this (1) disturbance financial market diminishing; (2) degree fiscal austerity, continuing, ease somewhat; (3) competitiveness peripheral countries’ export begin recover progress structural reforms, include reduction labor costs. the chinese economy generally pick since autumn 2012, government’s expansionary fiscal measure center primarily infrastructure investment monetary ease measure produce positive effects. the real gdp growth 2 bi central bankers’ speech rate january-march quarter 2013 expect recover 8.0–9.0 percent level first time year. in circumstances, look outlook global economy whole, real gdp growth rate expect accelerate moderately 3.2 percent 2012 3.5 percent 2013 4.1 percent 2014, accord late world economic outlook release international monetary fund (imf) january 2013. if global economy – lead emerge economy – register growth rate projected, rate historical long-term average. ii. current situation japan’s economy prospects, key factor pick-up overseas economy a. level japan’s economy japan’s economy remain relatively weak latter half 2012, export production decrease significantly due mainly deceleration overseas economies, turn adversely affect domestic demand business fix investment manufacture industry. however, recent development show pace decrease export moderate production appear stop decreasing. base developments, monetary policy meet (mpm) hold february 13 14, 2013, bank japan revise upward basic assessment domestic economy, assessment economy remain relatively weak assessment appear stop weakening. the level production mainly attributable three factors. first, effect end subsidy purchase energy-efficient cars, temporarily exert strong downward pressure car production, fall off. second, effect recent development relation japan china, deal serious blow particularly export car relate items, ease somewhat. and third, pace decrease export moderate overseas economy unite state china show sign pick up. nevertheless, export show sign level out, necessary closely monitor whether clear increase occur exports, expect become drive force full-fledged economic recovery. consequently, uncertainty remain japan’s economy achieve full-fledged recovery. b. effect fiscal policy measures, depreciation yen, rise stock price japan’s growth rate 2013 expect rise relatively steadily, line accumulation temporary boost effect various policy measures. first, implementation supplementary budget fiscal 2012 20 trillion yen expect effect, particularly public investment, april-june quarter 2013 onward. second, recent development foreign exchange rate stock price – support part expectation new administration’s economic fiscal policy well bank’s enhancement monetary ease – expect gradually positive effect mainly export private consumption. third, front-loaded increase demand prior hike consumption tax schedule april 2014 likely take place particularly demand house durable consumer goods. accord median forecast majority bank’s policy board member interim assessment october 2012 outlook economic activity prices, release january 2013, real gdp growth rate expect 1.0 percent fiscal 2012, accelerate 2.3 percent fiscal 2013, decline 0.8 percent fiscal 2014 even account effect consumption tax hike. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food expect rise bi central bankers’ speech 3 gradually reflect improvement output gap result economic growth rate continue exceed potential growth rate. a median forecasts, year-on-year rate change cpi project minus 0.2 percent fiscal 2012, 0.4 percent fiscal 2013, 0.9 percent fiscal 2014 exclude direct effect consumption tax hike. meanwhile, regard risk factors, attention pay prospect european debt problem, momentum toward recovery u.s. economy, possibility emerge commodity-exporting economy make smooth transition sustainable growth path, effect recent development relation japan china. with factor take consideration, high degree uncertainty remain concern japan’s economy. iii. downside risk economic outlook a. weak recovery overseas economy with respect aforementioned baseline scenario outlook economic activity price japan, i consider downside risk rather large. the great concern arise possibility deceleration overseas economies. although overseas economy likely gradually emerge current deceleration phase, sustainability recovery likely remain unpredictable. in unite states, house investment private consumption expect drive force pick-up economy short run; recent uptrend long-term interest rate strengthen suddenly, however, could adversely affect fund house investment car purchases. attention also pay risk persist uncertainty fiscal policy could exert downward pressure u.s. economy influence public sentiment. with regard euro area, necessary remain continually vigilant risk financial market could suffer renew disturbance political social instability hind fiscal consolidation economic structural reform slow progress coordinate national interest hamper europe’s ongoing integration formation fiscal bank union. in addition, since banks’ lend attitude show sign easing, risk fund constraint could prevent economy emerge deceleration phase long time. a china, government’s policy stance focus attention. because aggressive fiscal measure adopt lehman shock leave many issue unresolved – excessive capital stock overheat real estate market – china’s previous administration remain cautious public spend despite decelerate economy. the current administration also appear maintain cautious stance. in addition, chinese government remain vigilant (1) rise inflation rate, (2) upturn major cities’ house prices, previous administration seek contain, (3) rapid expansion shadow bank trust business, personal asset flow gain high returns. the possibility therefore rule government reverse accommodative stance fiscal policy. in term monetary policy, people’s bank china indicate intention place top priority control inflation. moreover, response expansion bank lend january 2013, authority reportedly instruct large bank constrain lending. the authority state intention strengthen risk management associate shadow banking, case risk infrastructure investment real estate investment significantly suppressed. b. continuation large negative output gap major economy aside short-term downside risk i mentioned, concern medium long term: could take time u.s. european economies, well 4 bi central bankers’ speech chinese economy, overcome aftereffect credit bubble. similar occur japan, firm likely continue cautious stance employment households’ medium- long-term income expectation likely weaken view persistently high unemployment rate, cause economy lag behind achieve self-sustaining recovery expansion employment income. what i wish highlight since lehman shock, output gap – indicate aggregate demand supply balance – largely negative across advance economies. accord organisation economic co-operation development (oecd), output gap advance economies, reach minus 4.0 percent gdp 2009, expect exceed minus 3.0 percent 2013, minus 3.3 percent. in oecd’s projection output gap november 2012, output gap japan minus 2.1 percent 2013, unite state euro area substantially negative. the large negative output gap advance economy indicate prolong excess production capacity labor aftermath credit bubble, appear form balance-sheet adjustments. this type situation cause firm post low profit restrain investment, cause household low income expectation restrain consumption, exert downward pressure already-declining inflation rate. with situation spread widely major economies, japan’s main export destinations, considerable uncertainty inevitably remain japan’s export environment long run. c. expansion trade deficit financial market stability with regard downside risk japan’s economy, due attention pay continue trend expansion trade deficit effect financial markets. a i mentioned, japan’s economic growth rate expect rise relatively smoothly time being, recovery overseas economy could lack momentum. in addition, import raw material expect remain high level. this situation could cause japan’s trade deficit expand. an expansion trade deficit cause yen depreciate mainly change supply-demand balance foreign exchange markets. this could destabilize financial markets, buoyant economy rise import price also reduction surplus fund domestic market cause long-term interest rate rise. attention therefore pay effect expansion trade deficit financial market well economic activity. furthermore, long-term interest rate could rise credibility conduct fiscal policy undermined. the rise long-term interest rate could significantly affect japan’s economy, depend degree rise, could also affect economy greatly aggravate instability bank system. long-term interest rate japan stable far, may regard evidence credibility fiscal policy maintained. however, give unexpected event may trigger sudden nonlinear change market sentiment, experience european debt problem, necessary continue careful monitor identify change risk factors. iv. development price wage japan characteristic before i move onto next topic monetary policy conduct, i would like discus development price wage japan, closely link topic, give personal view background prolong deflation. a. historical development japan’s inflation rate comparison major economy since 1980s, japan’s inflation rate remain consistently low level, unlike case major economies. accord oecd, decade 1985 bi central bankers’ speech 5 1995, year-on-year rate change cpi g-7 country 3.3 percent average, japan 1.4 percent. for 15 year thereafter, 1996 2011, year-on-year rate change cpi g-7 country 1.9 percent average, japan minus 0.1 percent. the difference average japan’s inflation rate g-7 country remain mostly unchanged: approximately 1.9 percent first ten year 1985 around 2.0 percent 15 year thereafter, japan’s economy fell deflation. this indicate that, 25 year whole, japan major economy generally experience long downtrend inflation rates. i see possibility japan’s deflation might bring downtrend global inflation. in particular, large negative output gap – state excessive supply – continue see major economy since lehman shock, back balance-sheet adjustment aftermath credit bubble. this create environment inflation rate subject downward pressure, development overseas could also consider exert downward pressure price development japan. b. major factor behind difference inflation rate japan unite states: service sector i would also like compare examine price development japan abroad. for example, compare price development japan unite states, japan year-on-year rate change cpi minus 0.2 percent average 1997 2011, unite state 2.4 percent, result gap 2.6 percentage points. the major factor behind difference contribution price service le rent, account one-third 2.6 percentage point gap, 0.9 percentage point. when rent included, service price account almost two-thirds gap, 1.7 percentage points. in view, fact service price typically susceptible development wage may indicate reason japan’s price structure prone deflation suggest deflation overcome. c. relationship potential growth rate, wages, price a see earlier, accord oecd, since 2009 – negative output gap expand worldwide due effect lehman shock – negative output gap japan particularly large compare major economies, suggest level output gap solely determine level inflation rate. in consider cause deflation japan, attention therefore pay supply-side factors, rate increase labor productivity economy’s potential growth rate. in japan, relatively strong correlation potential growth rate per caput medium- long-term inflation expectations. this relationship consider reflect customary practice prevail employer employees: medium- long-term growth expectation decline burst economic bubble, japanese firm tend adjust wage rather employment, worker tend accept adjustments. although japan experience prolong deflation unprecedented among major economies, unemployment rate remain low relative economy employment situation show outstanding stability. in unite states, hand, employment fall decline wage price remain quite limit amid economic deterioration. these contrast show mean adjustment labor market differ japan unite states. with point take account, end deflation rise japan’s inflation rate require effort strengthen growth potential raise economy’s potential growth rate subsequently boost growth expectations. such improvement expect result 6 bi central bankers’ speech increase service price rise rate wage increase. however, wage increase unaccompanied strengthen growth potential rise productivity, depress corporate profits, turn could restrain business fix investment hamper steady economic growth. the possibility resultant deterioration employment income situation matter concern. on hand, inflation rate increase growth potential strengthen wage inflation remain unchanged, general standard live fall real terms. in sum, economic condition seek balance increase wage price basis strengthen growth potential. v. current future conduct monetary policy a. decision make mpm hold january 21 22, 2013 at mpm hold january 21 22, 2013, bank decide take additional step provide monetary accommodation decisively introduce two measures: “price stability target” 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi; “open-ended asset purchase method” asset purchase program (hereafter program). in addition two measures, another important decision strengthen policy coordination government bank. the bank, together government, decide release “joint statement government bank japan overcome deflation achieve sustainable economic growth.” the bank previously adopt “price stability goal medium long term,” judge positive range 2 percent low term year-on-year rate change cpi, set goal 1 percent time being. a i explain detail later, bank replace goal “price stability target” 2 percent follow reasons. first, increase awareness among general public even bank use term “price stability target” would conduct monetary policy automatic manner pursuit certain inflation rate. and second, progress achieve effort wide range entity – government strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy – increase likely occur inflation rate firm household perceive price stability – basis economic activity. there uncertainty regard strengthen growth potential japan’s economy proceed, bank expect set ambitious target secondary effect encourage effort range entities. in regard, “price stability target” 2 percent could serve sense kind “slogan” general public revitalization japan’s economy. moreover, bank introduce “open-ended asset purchase method” without set termination date, clearly show strong determination achieve “price stability target” 2 percent, consider result great policy effects. under current purchase method – make commitment term future level total size program – total size program increase 101 trillion yen end-2013 65 trillion yen end-2012, plan earlier. from january 2014 time, bank purchase 13 trillion yen financial assets, include 2 trillion yen jgbs, every month without set termination date. b. the bank’s price stability target importance next, i would like discus detail inflation target system, look example overseas systems. article 2 bank japan act stipulate “currency monetary control bank japan shall aim achieve price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy.” this tell u achieve price stability precondition sound development national economy sound development national economy – deeply impact public welfare – ultimate target monetary policy conduct. base thinking, policy conduct bi central bankers’ speech 7 aim achieve price stability target, important aim contribute stability development economy medium long term, carefully conduct policy monitor soundness financial system. at time, must note policy conduct aim guide inflation rate target automatic manner fact entail risk hamper medium- long-term economic stability. c. flexible inflation target system the introduction inflation target reserve bank new zealand 1988 first among central bank major economies, follow central bank canada unite kingdom. in new zealand, central bank aim target rigidly beginning, late recognize rigidity destabilize economy. for reason, introduction inflation target defer central bank japan, unite states, major economy europe. subsequently, however, central bank adopt inflation target make adjustment boost flexibility. many central bank specify time achieve target. even bank canada – specify term achieve target “typically within horizon six eight quarters” – allow adjustment length term depend development economic activity price ensure target’s flexibility. a result, central bank major economy present conduct policy aim achieve sustainable growth price stability assess current development outlook economic activity price well examine various risks, include stem accumulation financial imbalances. this policy framework often refer flexible inflation target system. the price stability target adopt bank japan base thinking. the bank clarify aim achieve price stability target 2 percent “at early possible time.” the intention behind clarification that, discuss earlier, achieve inflation target important – viewpoint ensure medium- long-term stability economy – secure flexibility policy conduct carefully ascertain risk arise from, example, accumulation financial imbalances. the bank aim achieve target “at early possible time” basis. in major economies, central bank introduce inflation target aim contain rise inflation reinforce independence government ensure transparency policy conduct. the bank japan, hand, introduce price stability target attempt overcome deflation. this point differ inflation target central banks, therefore bank’s action may regard unprecedented endeavor. d. vote mpms hold january february so far, i explain decision make mpm hold january 21 22, 2013. at meeting, i vote introduction price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi. the main reason vote already outline minute mpm, release february 19. although remark thus repeat them, i would like briefly review three reason outline minutes. first, inflation rate consistent sustainable price stability pursue bank consider largely affect general public’s current perception price developments, 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi rarely achieve past two decades, base general public’s current perception price development build past experience, 2 percent inflation rate considerably high inflation rate consider point consistent sustainable price stability. second, suggest that, even central bank set 2 percent inflation target, alone highly unlikely substantially influence inflation expectations. third, effort wide range entity toward strengthen growth potential japan’s economy essential order achieve 8 bi central bankers’ speech 2 percent target, 2 percent target set effort make progress effect effort confirmed, could impair credibility monetary policy due considerable uncertainty regard achievement target. for reasons, i judge bank’s commitment utmost achieve target 1 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi time would enhance policy effect appropriate current situation. subsequently, mpm hold february 13 14, i vote public statement include follow sentence: “the bank set price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi.” i still hold view easy task achieve price stability target 2 percent. neither significant change general public’s perception price development present. however, line recognition range entities, include government private sector, fulfill respective role overcome deflation, i consider financial market development introduction price stability target 2 percent appear reflect expectation bank’s monetary policy government’s various policy measures, important increase credibility regard bank’s decision price stability target 2 percent viewpoint overcome deflation. while monitor effect monetary policy spread economy, bank conduct policy aim achieve target responsible manner, carefully communicate policy intention consider decisive action additional monetary ease necessary. e. the bank’s policy stance achieve 2 percent price stability target in opinion, bank’s decision introduce open-ended asset purchase method aim achieve 2 percent price stability target indicate asset purchase market operation continue form core bank’s policy enhance monetary easing. specifically, decision base idea bank give great consideration produce policy effect affect market prices, comprehensive monetary ease policy aim for. this mean encourage decline longer-term interest rate reduction risk premium thereby ensure financial condition allow firm household raise fund low cost. there seem range view financial market currently feasibility 2 percent price stability target. if doubt arise market bank’s stance achieve target, could reduce policy effects. therefore, view avoid situation continue clearly show bank’s strong determination achieve target, important steadily conduct asset purchase program sustainable manner thereby produce intend policy effects. in regard, i discus three points: steadily increase amount outstanding program; strengthen coordination government maintain fiscal consolidation; communication public gain understand bank’s policy intention. f. issue regard operation asset purchase program first, let mention issue concern payment interest complementary deposit facility, payment interest excess reserve balance financial institutions’ current account bank. this issue need take account fact undersubscription – is, aggregate bid fall short bank’s offer – occur frequently fixed-rate funds-supplying operation pool collateral since turn year. generally speaking, degree monetary ease enhanced, financial institutions’ demand liquidity meet sufficiently, thereby reduce need fund provide bank; consequently market participant reduce incentive submit bid bank’s market operations. moreover, bid activity market operation affect supply demand condition market participants’ fund also various event speculation markets. therefore, bi central bankers’ speech 9 regard financial institutions’ current account hold bank, balance change along bank’s asset purchases, careful deliberation necessary discuss low abolishment payment interest excess reserve balance current accounts. since move would affect financial institutions’ incentive hold excess reserve bank, cost benefit assess take account sustainability asset purchase program. second, note remain maturity jgbs purchase program currently one three years. this take account fact average finance term use japanese firm around three years. on point, market participants, example, call extend remain maturity jgbs purchase program. some note importance enhance policy effect encourage decline longer-term interest rates, others mention need conduct asset purchase program smoothly ensure sustainability purchases. and third, bank purchase risk asset – namely, cp, corporate bonds, exchange-traded fund (etfs), japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) – purpose encourage decline risk premium markets, pay due attention potential cost impair bank’s balance sheet. on point, market participant state bank increase amount risk asset purchases. in regard, deliberate possibility either extend remain maturity jgbs purchase program increase amount risk asset purchased, essential bank carefully ass cost benefit light policy objective achieve 2 percent price stability target, give due consideration two point mention earlier: ensure sustainability asset purchase program produce intend policy effects. g. importance strengthen coordination government maintain fiscal consolidation the joint statement indicate bank set price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi, target pursue monetary ease aim achieve target early possible time. at time, government formulate measure strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy, promote strongly, well steadily promote measure aim establish sustainable fiscal structure. in order bank pursue powerful monetary ease aim achieve 2 percent price stability target, important credibility fiscal management firmly ensure financial markets. in regard, worth note obvious: policy coordination mention joint statement indicate “monetization,” is, central bank’s finance government’s fiscal deficit. the firm guarantee law many country central bank’s independence result bitter experience. specifically, underwrite government security central bank wartime lead substantial expansion government debt, become burden future generations. this underwrite also accelerate inflation destabilize financial market financial system, seriously degrade people’s live conditions. japan experience sharp inflation immediately end world war ii, response yen revalue freeze bank deposit imposed. while number people actually experience event gradually declining, one vital role central bank continue provide warn danger monetization base lesson history. in addition prevent monetization costs, essential avoid even emergence mere doubt financial market whether bank’s action could consider monetization. if doubt emerge, credibility fiscal policy would 10 bi central bankers’ speech undermine substantial degree fiscal crisis could occur, turn would inflict considerable damage economic activity, together crisis financial system. it recognize that, case, quality people’s life would significantly impaired. in addition joint statement government clarify stance emphasize fiscal discipline, cabinet decide fiscal consolidation target, aim halve primary balance deficit relative gdp fiscal 2015 fiscal 2010 level achieve surplus fiscal 2020. it appear move contribute contain risk concern monetization emerge financial markets. if government’s determination regard fiscal consolidation spread market – communication consistency supplementary budget fiscal 2012 medium-term fiscal consolidation policy well path achieve fiscal consolidation – give bank room proceed purchase government security without cause concern monetization. this would also help achieve 2 percent price stability target. h. importance communication public gain understand bank’s policy intention with view strengthen policy coordination bank government, important deepen public’s understand bank’s think conduct monetary policy specific actions. the bank consider essential make utmost effort end. to understanding, issue need explain thoroughly deepen public’s understand follows. first, principle conduct monetary policy, important policy aim achieve price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy. second, regard effect monetary policy price developments, i continue attach importance transmission mechanism monetary policy influence demand, thereby encourage improvement output gap; regard, transmission mechanism monetary policy underpin inflation expectation also noteworthy. and third, i consider medium- long-term trend inflation rate largely determine supply-side factors, growth rate productivity potential growth rate economy, words, growth potential economy. i. function policy board member make monetary policy decision in remainder remarks, i briefly touch central bank committee system monetary policy decision make result deliberation among committee members, rather one individual. the bank japan act stipulate policy board shall established, compose nine member – governor, two deputy governors, six member policy board. it also stipulate matter concern monetary policy shall decide policy board. this type committee system currently adopt bank japan also major central banks. in book the quiet revolution: central bank go modern, alan s. blinder, former vice chairman board governor federal reserve system, positively assess advantage group decision make policy committee basis certain assumptions. he point two development behind spread committee system: worldwide trend increase central bank independence government; grow recognition system’s success unite state germany, introduce pioneer effort. he also note decision make member committee could help avoid certain risk associate decision make single individual thereby generate good outcomes. in vote taking, member bank japan’s policy board give equal vote make judgment independently. the split vote occur january 2013 mpm demonstrate member’s autonomy respected. this also reflect bi central bankers’ speech 11 provision bank japan act member policy board shall appoint cabinet, subject consent house representative house councillors, shall dismiss term office five years, except special case become incapable carry duty due mental physical disorder. at time, policy board member conduct daily duty fully recognize responsibility – choose election – grant considerable authority make monetary policy decisions, significantly affect people’s lives. therefore, order maintain enhance public’s trust, i believe vital enhance transparency conduct monetary policy – is, communication diet public thoroughly explain bank’s think conduct monetary policy. we also listen due respect government’s public’s opinion monetary policy conduct work incorporate policymaking, i regard today’s meet one opportunity this. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: post-trade harmonisation financial market integration europe open remark mr mario draghi, president european central bank, conference “post-trade harmonisation integration financial markets: joint effort”, organise european central bank european commission, frankfurt main, 19 march 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, i please welcome frankfurt today open important conference post-trade harmonisation financial market integration europe. this conference result joint effort european central bank european commission, i would like thank organiser put together excellent programme. i please see many distinguish speaker public private sector agree share view post-trade harmonisation contribute financial integration europe. in time severe economic challenges, particularly important commitment achieve truly single european market reaffirmed. a understand, well-functioning internal market generate many benefits, include low prices, freedom choice individual good opportunity firms. what europe achieve far indisputable – often take granted. people sometimes focus perceive difficulty cause single market individual national perspective. but important acknowledge huge benefit european integration daily life day-to-day business. great financial integration key part build single market – something improve function national financial systems. financial integration lead good risk-sharing diversification, make market deep liquid, encourage competition, turn reduce cost intermediation. in addition, financial integration foster efficient allocation capital, high productivity, strong sustainable non-inflationary economic growth. financial integration essential make europe stronger, important ecb’s govern council. we fully commit make happen, especially time fragmentation single financial market lead fragmentation single monetary policy. a aware, disruptive effect severe fragmentation single financial market tangible consequences, diverge fund cost banks. this result uneven transmission interest rate reduction firm household across euro area. for reason, ecb identify effective policy tool repair disruptions, remain within mandate. financial integration clearly interest market strongly support post-trade harmonisation initiative take place within eu legislative, operational business levels. these initiative aim remove national barrier thus reduce fragmentation european post-trade landscape. the integration market infrastructure, harmonisation agenda trigger t2s regulatory framework key element coordinate harmonisation effort complement support financial integration. 2 bi central bankers’ speech it lens topic today’s conference analysed. key question include: contribute improve post-trade harmonisation? what process change? and action take benefit it? the speaker give u answer explore various harmonisation initiatives, link change regulatory framework market infrastructure. last may, i participated, along you, sign contractual agreement eurosystem csds decide participate t2s. i stress fundamental objective t2s contribute make europe good place invest. let say objective unique t2s. it objective harmonisation effort undertake post-trade field, parties. it definitely joint effort, i see commitment public authority european national level, also commitment market participants, csds ccps. i sure share goal, namely make europe strong attractive domestic foreign investment, thus stimulate sustain growth. through coordinate action many stakeholders, financial market become safer, transparent and, therefore, efficient integrated. dismantle legal operational barriers, aim current eu legislative proposal new infrastructure t2s, benefit adapt business model competitive landscape. it important highlight benefit t2s fully achieve current harmonisation effort successfully implement european level especially national level. let specific give examples. in term infrastructure, t2s necessary platform set single european market security services. in term benefit europe, t2s make post-trade environment safe efficient. it reduce cost settle security transaction bring significant collateral save market participants. these collateral save particularly valuable time demand high-quality collateral continue increase, result crisis new regulatory developments. but reap full benefit launch t2s require complement provision lay csd regulation propose commission. both initiative support harmonisation agenda advance eurosystem european fora. the csd regulation critical post-trade harmonisation effort europe. the ecb’s govern council state strong support propose regulation, enhance legal operational condition cross-border settlement eu general t2s particular. in respect, ecb recommend propose regulation correspond implement act adopt prior launch t2s. work also progress eurosystem level improve possibility cross-border use collateral eurosystem credit operations, increase efficiency. further benefit expect market-led initiative enhance interoperability triparty service europe. i want pre-empt interest discussion today, let conclude say everyone need involve process. every contribution matters; every action relevant. i confident today’s conference clarify role u play important phase european integration, i look forward continue work together. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 john mcdermott: the role forecast monetary policy speech dr john mcdermott, assistant governor head economics reserve bank new zealand, finsia (financial service institute australasia), wellington, 15 march 2013. * * * 1. introduction a well known, reserve bank act require bank seek maintain price stability, objective similar spirit modern advanced-country central banks. the governor legally responsible monetary policy decision make independently government. last week explain speech make communicate important reserve bank decisions.1 because economy never rest, monetary policy action take time affect inflation, forecast economic condition essential part make decisions. the forward-looking nature monetary policy reflect policy target agreement (pta) governor bank minister finance, specify price stability target “future cpi inflation outcome one percent three percent average medium term, focus keep future average inflation near two percent target midpoint”. there difficulty uncertainty involve assess current state economy likely future path. modern central bank therefore put huge amount energy forecasting. event global financial crisis canterbury earthquake show must prepare pivot, time quickly. reflect complex policymaking environment, bank’s govern committee advise team 40 economist financial market analysts, include two external monetary policy adviser draw private sector. this speech explain forecast fit monetary policy process. i’ll address limitation trade-off involve forecast manage monetary policy decision-making, illustrate discuss important issue current forecast. 2. the forecast process economic framework forecast link bank’s policy rate decision strategy requirement set pta. the forecast process follow quarterly cycle two ocr reviews, one accompany monetary policy statement quarter. through quarter, examine incoming data, update forecast track scenarios, discus policy risks. input process many various. we draw official data, survey information cover output, sales, employment, consumption, investment, exports, imports, wages, price on. we visit business labour organisation represent country’s region economic sector gather up-to-date perspective economic development “on ground”. we analyse agencies’ forecast stay close touch central banks. our market monitor prudential supervision activity provide financial credit market intelligence. finally, external monetary policy adviser key source private sector input deliberations. 1 wheeler, g (2013) “decision make reserve bank new zealand”, speech deliver university auckland business school, 7 march. 2 bi central bankers’ speech we use form coherent picture international domestic condition macroeconomic projection. the projection capture view likely future development inflation, output, employment, interest rates, exchange rate key macroeconomic variables, base information hand understand economy works. the economic framework form assessment support policy decision require economic framework boil large complex set information something manageable. the framework include fundamental economic principle anchor analysis dialogue. these include big lesson 1970s experience, can’t sustainably get high growth tolerate bite inflation, try eventually cause high variable inflation, damage economy. long-run growth fundamentally determine growth productive base economy – is, labour, capital stock knowledge. the best contribution monetary policy make long-run growth keep aggregate inflation predictably low, form useful benchmark price behaviour. this involve counteracting, possible, inflation effect emerge economic pressure (sometimes refer shocks). in understand macroeconomic consequence shocks, main effect account follows. firstly, inflation tend fall demand weak enough slack labour good market (technically, “negative output gap”), rise opposite true. this relationship obvious case non-tradable inflation (see figure 1). secondly, investment consumption demand tend rise interest rate fall. thirdly, exchange rate tend high relative prospective return available new zealand offshore. finally, short term interest rates, reflect price stability objective monetary policy, tend rise response increase future inflation pressure. all key macroeconomic variable therefore link together economic behavioural tendencies. we say “tendencies” thing mention matter too, may time substantial driver pattern see data. for example, major source exchange rate fluctuation new zealand outlook world price commodity export term trade. house investment move quite substantially ebb flow net migration. government spend fiscal policy change source demand shock. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the role model need judgement the overall variation data therefore view combination sequence shock response economy shocks. one major task economic analyst disentangle two, least conceptually. one tool use help task structural forecast model, continue long tradition use model forecast policy analysis. the model calibrate “typical” economic behaviour observe past two decade price stability new zealand, embed fairly standard view economic behaviour outline above. it key feature include intuitive economic mechanisms, relatively simple structure, adaptability accommodate range economic circumstances. use model provide number benefits. it enable u link policy decision objective economic outlook, consider simultaneous shock interaction among economic variable systematically consistently, ensure consistency interpret flow data forecast update policy decisions. but even advance model abstract representation economy, forecast model deliberately design relatively simple adaptable. too much complexity would make difficult understand transmission mechanism dynamic model, would unlikely improve forecast accuracy materially. judgemental input model adjustment model’s output therefore necessary part build forecast – indeed process add judgement help u form view outlook systematic manner. there three main motivation add judgement currently. firstly, response rare event global financial crisis canterbury earthquake will, design, pick forecast model calibrate “average” experience last 20 years. secondly, like macroeconomic models, model explicitly model financial sector, key feature modern economies. the model framework include interest rate spread float mortgage rate 90-day bank bill rate, point typically add judgement account financial factor model. finally, judgement need account economy respond different point business cycle, since model generally generate average response see across cycle. judgemental adjustment framework often motivate qualitative information receive business visits, well knowledge experience forecaster gain many business cycles. a noted, forecast update regularly. a new data come quarter, able learn errors, get sense bite model trust keep adjusting, revise forecast accordingly. 3. monetary policy, risk management trade-off monetary policy operate complex environment. in develop central projection, must consider multiple risk trade-offs. monetary policy risk management the likelihood various economic outcome affect markedly cost benefit alternative policy actions. form view likelihood is, furthermore, subject range uncertainties. firstly, information economy’s current state direction rate movement difficult read, conflict sometimes revised. secondly, important economic concept cannot even directly observed, include “potential” level output consistent stable inflation, “neutral” rate interest 4 bi central bankers’ speech neither stimulatory contractionary effect spending. thirdly, understand economic behaviour imperfect, behaviour shift time economy’s structure opportunity available firm household change. because uncertainties, monetary policy often appear “cautious”, sense that, normal circumstances, tend adjust interest rate quite smoothly economic developments, least compare observe volatility data. this reflect desire jerk economy around response bump data may turn quite temporary. but economy hit big unusual shock quite outside range possibility one might reasonably anticipate, purpose monetary policy least. the series canterbury earthquakes, event global financial crisis, obvious examples. when big event hit, monetary response instead may rapid, reflect sure outlook markedly changed. these uncertainty explain limit predictive power economic forecasts. our analysis generally suggest forecast track record somewhat good average forecasters.2 but also clear forecaster face difficulty predict future economic outcome beyond next quarters. quite simply, much happen timeframe. the central projection monetary policy statement therefore represent one path many possible. monetary policy trade-off even know future perfectly, would face important choice quickly strongly react economic pressure seek restore future inflation target. these choice impact economic volatility adjustment period. the pta recognise trade-off. it require bank seek avoid unnecessary instability interest rates, output exchange rate pursuit price stability target. this know flexible inflation target inflation-targeting country take basic approach. the forecast framework enable trade-off systematically address balanced. there’s often concern, example, increase policy interest rate adversely affect growth cause exchange rate appreciation. but hike interest rate reason. while high interest rate normally associate high exchange rate, usually reflect strengthen economy due force spending, pickup foreign demand, rise term trade, increase government spending. it therefore follow keep interest rate low otherwise order prevent exchange rate appreciation would necessarily successful. assume inflation target credible, strength domestic economy generally cause exchange rate appreciate even without immediate policy tightening, people anticipate eventual monetary tighten order limit rise inflation pressure. this kind response consistent principle economic behaviour outline above. the sustain economic expansion new zealand prior global financial crisis illustrate trade-off well. the ocr steadily raise 200 basis point 2003 2006 new zealand dollar exchange rate move 55 u cent 75 u cents. even tighten monetary condition magnitude sufficient prevent cpi 2 the late assessment forecast accuracy labbé pepper (2009). mccaw ranchhod (2002) also useful detail discussion reason historical pattern forecast errors. bi central bankers’ speech 5 inflation reach three percent end 2006 (figure 2). we could perhaps lean hard expansion time, would probably exaggerate exchange rate cycle upswing downswing. we draw several lesson experience. one strong force new zealand economy, policy set may need lean quite hard them. a second financial cycle surprisingly large long-lasting. a third force small open economy cause large exchange rate swings. difficult judgement must make balance across trade-offs. issue current forecast our current forecast also show current challenge predict balance oppose economic forces, recognise uncertainties, account trade-offs. the combination global financial crisis canterbury earthquake leave legacy tough economic issue resolve. the persistently elevate exchange rate, high household debt overhang, substantial fiscal consolidation weigh economy, act opposite direction rise house price large construction spend surge canterbury rebuild. our central projection indicate low inflation near-term strengthen medium-term. mindful requirement focus future average inflation medium term, policy strategy “smooth through” near-term variation inflation forward-looking manner. the “net” effect time quite sensitive assumptions. our task quarterly forecast update keep speed incoming evidence whether assumption accurate. judgement particularly important respect future movement exchange rate. the exchange rate move sharply suddenly, reason cannot foresee even hindsight connection seem quite obvious. often, sudden large downward movement (depreciations) result large sudden shock offshore, see onset asian crisis mid-1997 sudden intensification global financial disruption 2008 (figure 3). 6 bi central bankers’ speech at times, unexpectedly long period strong weak relative economic performance, strong force commodity price swing domestic demand pressures, generate substantial prolong departure exchange rate long-run average levels. a second key judgement forecast extent household spend constrain high debt level gfc experience, implication degree strengthen house market fee private consumption. finally, profile wide spillover effect construction cost canterbury rebuild depend upon capacity pressure resolved. our current judgement household debt position mean consumption likely follow le pronounce upswing result house market upturn historically case, concentrate character rebuild mean spillover effect house market rest country muted. however, since little recent experience benchmark events, monitor evidence carefully ensure judgement area remain reasonable. the current environment also confront u trade-off across policy objectives. near-term inflation low forecast gradually increase back midpoint target range. an interest rate cut might help inflation return target sooner. but cut would also probably exacerbate current strength house prices, risk increase private debt levels, potentially raise financial stability issues. indeed, pta specify that, set monetary policy, must monitor asset price regard soundness efficiency financial system.3 on hand, interest rate hike might limit house market risks, could also place upward pressure exchange rate. in near future, macro-prudential measure part toolkit respond financial stability risks. these measure generally support complement effort stabilise inflation monetary policy, upswings macroeconomy often coincide increase asset price leverage. we’re currently engage consultation regard use macro-prudential instrument say upcoming financial stability report. 3 a box december 2012 monetary policy statement explain new pta. bi central bankers’ speech 7 4. forecast support accountability communication activity forecasts, risk assessment management trade-off critical element communication policy strategy accountability actions. we aim clear possible monetary policy statement economic outlook strategy frame monetary policy decision plans.4 shortly statement published, governor hold press conference statement review parliament’s finance expenditure select committee. the bank’s board directors, appoint minister finance, formally review statement ocr decision part duty monitor constantly reserve bank’s performance obligation act. these various examination question answer session thorough. in addition, senior bank staff travel around new zealand give talk explain main consideration support late decision. by explain rationale policy decisions, enable view discuss challenged. the statement thus act record monetary policy deliberations. some central bank instead publish minute monetary policy meetings, amount much thing. our communication activity also intend assist economy stabilise inflation expectations. publish forecast help market ass economic environment understand policy strategy.5 we publish policy outlook since 1997 form future path short term interest rates. a number central banks, include sweden norway, subsequently follow practice. the future interest rate track projection represent bank’s best view outlook monetary policy set give information hand time, commitment particular path shown. our analysis show long market regard publish interest rate path commitment, benefit economy publication numbers.6 there various way communicate policy outlook. we present projection single narrow line. of course, around line range possibility widen markedly ahead one looks. we find project single central projection, though, simplify discussion considerably, make forecast number easy connect forecast story. there obvious risk oversimplification inadvertently convey unrealistic precision approach. but hand, show unhelpfully wide range undermine central message. different central bank handle issue different ways. some use “fan charts” show distribution possible outcomes, others use explicit implicit statement policy “bias” rather project path interest rates. in case we’ve place emphasis clarity basis policy decision outlook, think large fan could obscure extent hide relationship different macroeconomic variable forecast story. a another mean show relationship inform policy, make use “alternative scenarios”, work quantitatively implication forecast number different set key assumptions, show outcome might differ central projections. for example, monetary policy statement release yesterday feature alternative scenario discussion (distinct) possibility 4 blind et al. (2008) discus aspect monetary policy communication detail. 5 svensson (2006) woodford (2005) offer useful discussion principle. 6 bergstrom karagedikli (2013). 8 bi central bankers’ speech exchange rate might follow different path, high lower, current central projection. 5. conclusion forecast difficult essential part modern monetary policy. this reflect economy never state rest, lag change ocr effect economy. forecast provide value explain economic story frame risk underpin policy strategy. if do well, process help policymakers, firm household plan adapt change circumstances. a well enforce

competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy speech mr masaaki shirakawa, governor bank japan, executive member meet policy board nippon keidanren (japan business federation), tokyo, 28 february 2013. * * * introduction it great honor opportunity address executive member meet policy board nippon keidanren today. before i start, let express deep appreciation information view current development economic financial activity well policy conduct provide u member firms. today’s speech last one i give governor bank japan. however, difficult decide today’s main topic, “toward strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy”, press issue japan present. it also important theme bank japan. a know, monetary policy meet january, bank decide introduce “price stability target” set 2 percent.1 this target introduce base recognition progress would make wide range entity effort toward strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy (chart 1). for reason, extremely important conduct monetary policy whether effort actually make progress. in following, i would like talk theme pay due regard perspective macroeconomics, corporate behavior, economic policymaking. i. the aim economic policy while active discussion regard conduct economic policy japan, i first consider aim economic policy kind situation expect japan’s economy attain. needle say, ultimate aim economic policy raise live standard citizen. while single indicator gauge people’s quality life, put approximate terms, key aim macroeconomic policy raise per caput consumption level, raise real gross domestic product (gdp), closely relate former, sustainable manner (chart 2). have say this, detail discussion necessary consider various option regard economic policy basis situation face japan’s economy. first, need consider effect decline labor force due rapid age japan’s population. japan’s current real gdp remain level see prior lehman shock. look per caput real gdp figures, drop japan relatively small compare country europe (chart 3). furthermore, term level real gdp per working-age person, japan exceed pre-crisis level, good performance unite states. while “population decline” one clichés use discuss japan’s economy, fundamental fact oftentimes disregard discuss economic developments. of course, figure differ significantly within short time period quarter year, consider japan’s 1 for detail decision make monetary policy meet january 22, 2013, include introduction “price stability target”, please see masaaki shirakawa, “the roles, missions, challenge central bank” (speech japan national press club tokyo), january 25, 2013. http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/press/koen_2013/data/ko130130a.pdf 2 bi central bankers’ speech economic policy medium long term, important think term change per caput per worker data. second, need take account progress economic globalization. specifically, necessary look real gdp also real gross national income (gni). real gni concept income result make follow two adjustment real gdp. one source adjustment overseas income japanese nationals. look figure 2012, overseas income amount 14.3 trillion yen – is, 3.0 percent nominal gdp. in recent years, profit outward direct investment increase addition profit outward portfolio investment (chart 4). the source adjustment change real purchase power due change foreign term trade. japan’s term trade deteriorate recent years, mainly due rise commodity price background high growth emerge economies. trade gains/losses – words, real purchase power arise change term trade – thus decline trend (chart 5). term trade undergo changes, due commodity price also response price power japanese firm non-price competitiveness exports. fluctuation foreign exchange rates, example depreciation yen, raise real gdp increase export may time adversely affect trade gains/losses. effect real gni depend net result take account two adjustment (chart 6). set 2000 base year, real overseas income increase 2.5 time 2012, push real gdp 2012 1.9 percent compare 2000. on hand, trade gain push real gdp downward 5.8 percent. third, another topic discussion treat nominal gdp real gdp consider economic policy. on point, increase economy grow sustainable manner, suggest direction medium- long-term policy different depend figure take account. what i must mention cause-and-effect relationship two. the basic causal relationship that, real gdp rises, output gap tighten price subsequently rise, result rise nominal gdp (chart 7). there situations, course, price fluctuate first, see time oil crises. in situation, however, economic condition deteriorate, different wish see. what try achieve economic policy raise real gdp, result nominal gdp rise. in relation this, result opinion survey general public’s view behavior bank conduct individual quarterly basis provide interest findings. the survey result reveal approximately 80 percent respondent – irrespective sex, age, occupation – consistently view price rise “rather unfavorable” throughout past survey (chart 8). underlie survey result concern wage may rise even price rise. a considerable portion japanese public simply look situation price rise. in phrase “overcoming deflation”, people look situation one’s salary rises, employment secured, profit increase; words, situation characterize well-balanced improvement economic condition consequent rise prices. the fourth point involve problem distribute fruit economic growth. while market mechanism play key role order economy grow, require perspective society whole accept mechanism large. on point, situation surround income distribution one crucial factors. in unite states, period economic expansion precede lehman shock – 2002 2007 – real income highest-income household top 1 percentile increase 86 percent household average income increase 20 percent. in contrast, “median” household income – is, income represent middle series household income arrange order size – increase 10 percent, amount half growth average income (chart 9). the situation surround income distribution partly depend proportion elderly earnings, bi central bankers’ speech 3 review single indicator therefore challenging. japan’s case may extreme unite states. nevertheless, awareness need achieve well-balanced economic growth, especially middle class, increase around globe. ii. the need strengthen competitiveness growth potential bear issue relate aim economic policy mind, let move need strengthen competitiveness growth potential.2 look development country’s economic growth rate long term, factor affect break real supply-side factor – namely, capital stock, labor force, technological innovation. explain within framework so-called growth accounting, growth rate break growth number worker value-added per worker, words, labor productivity growth rate (chart 10). mechanically estimate future growth number workers, base assumption recent labor participation rate gender age, number worker japan change rate –0.6 percent per annum 2010s –0.8 percent 2020s. meanwhile, labor productivity growth rate year 2000 2008 – period characterize relatively favorable economic condition – 1.4 percent annual basis. add aforementioned growth number workers, average growth become 0.8 percent 2010s 0.6 percent 2020s. this merely amount maintain positive growth next two decades. japan’s economy face considerably strong headwind form decline labor force, need seriously acknowledge implications. raise labor productivity growth rate alleviate problem, course. japan achieve growth rate slightly exceed average g-7 country past 10 years, however, plausible think raise 1 percent (chart 11). at rate, raise japan’s growth potential continuously future require work, especially strenuous work, number worker labor productivity growth rate. while effort wide range entity necessary case, main actor here, all, private firms. the corporate sector consistently save surplus, together households, since 1998 (chart 12). a significant save surplus corporate sector phenomenon observe outside japan well: spread major advance country since start 2000s. in term amount save surplus relative gdp, figure unite kingdom, japan, unite state 6.1 percent, 4.6 percent, 4.1 percent, respectively. the significant underlie cause save surplus lack attractive investment opportunity home amid expand investment opportunity emerge markets. recently, cause also point out, include secure fund offset additional cost may arise lack fund corporate pension mainly result decline interest rates. i presume day-to-day decision making, cannot muster enough confidence invest home despite ample liquidity hand (chart 13). in fact, on-hand cash deposit japanese firm increase steadily: proportion japanese firm list first second section tokyo stock exchange (tse) hold cash deposit exceed amount interest-bearing debt – words, firm without net external borrow – recently become high 43 percent. 2 the importance strengthen growth potential supply side something many central bank emphasize. please see, example, speech give mervyn king, governor bank england, cbi northern ireland mid-winter dinner, belfast, 22 january 2013. http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ publications/documents/speeches/2013/speech631.pdf 4 bi central bankers’ speech of course, firms’ ample on-hand liquidity reasonable level, take account experience post-bubble financial crisis aftermath failure lehman brother – is, shortage u.s. dollar fund decline function cp market. the current level on-hand liquidity, however, appear go well beyond amount precautionary demand. a use excess funds, three options: make real financial investment home abroad; disburse fund employee form wages; return stockholder dividend payment share buybacks. the economy see positive outcome unless kind change bring increase liquidity via one aforementioned routes. in sense, extremely important change business environment, thereby modify firms’ incentives. that achieve sustainable growth price stability, effort toward strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy necessary much monetary policy indispensable regard. iii. outline course future measure next, i would like outline course future effort toward strengthen economy’s competitiveness growth potential. capture increase overseas demand the first course capture increase overseas demand form expand japanese firms’ overseas business activities. it inappropriate negatively describe effort “hollowing-out” industry environment overseas economy – mainly emerge economy – grow much fast japan. with regard international division labor, manufacture assembly overseas expands, increase export intermediate good japan reinforce domestic r&d activity, whose value-added relatively higher, contribute raise japan’s real gdp. in addition, surplus fund accumulate corporate sector use overseas investment high returns, benefit investment pass back japan form interest dividends. this directly contribute raise real gdp, raise real gni. while globalization economy continues, deem imperative make balance effort nation combine domestic production export well foreign direct investment, local production overseas. indeed, overseas investment japanese firm increasing, especially asia. such trend spread large manufacture firm nonmanufacturing ones, well small medium-sized enterprise (chart 14). nevertheless, outstanding amount japan’s foreign direct investment remain low level compare advance country (chart 15). similarly, term profitability foreign investment, combination portfolio investment direct investment, japan fall little behind country unite states, partly small share direct investment, high rate return (chart 16). huge potential demand exist emerge economies, particularly asia, area build core infrastructure transportation systems, energy supply, communication systems. accord estimate asian development bank, demand amount approximately 8 trillion u.s. dollar 2010 2020 (chart 17). there ample business opportunity japanese firm make use globally recognize cutting-edge technology wealth experience – upgrade metropolitan infrastructure implement environmental energy-saving technologies, well deploy factory automation system address labor shortage wage rise – nurture japan years. it become increasingly apparent japanese firm sector retail, healthcare, education, focus mainly domestic market, able formulate sweep business strategy large asian markets, consumer demand increase briskly countries’ middle-income population continue expand. bi central bankers’ speech 5 respond age population the second course respond rapidly age population. the long average life expectancy japanese people imply health, condition vital well-being, fulfil high level. have say that, necessary adjust economic structure social infrastructure population continue age. otherwise, become difficult maintain current high quality life. while sometimes misunderstood, demographic change population age trigger problem japan’s economy; real issue japan’s economic structure social infrastructure sufficiently catch demographic changes. the age population bring various change economy. first, become downside factor economic growth via economy’s supply side – namely, decline labor force. in order counter trend, important increase labor participation, particularly elderly women.3 the labor participation rate 60–69 year-olds increase continuously last year (chart 18). the labor participation rate woman also increasing, remain relatively low level compare advance economy (chart 19). age also substantially change demand structure economy. the area medical nurse care one worth mentioning. in unite states, elderly population age 65 old increase 13 percent ten year 2000, result, expenditure medical nurse care rise 82 percent. by contrast, japan, elderly population increase 29 percent, expenditure rise 17 percent (chart 20). in relation this, often point that, japan, due number regulation shortage workforce, sufficient service sector provide relative demand. while one mindful fiscal implications, appropriate system design regulatory reform likely turn potential demand medical nurse care, well medical equipment infrastructure, actual demand. at time, medical nurse care could become one promise domestic employer japanese firm expand overseas operation (chart 21).4 population age also bring expansion demand house market. for child-raising generation, potential demand large house believe high, demand satisfied, particularly metropolitan areas. on contrary, member elderly generation continue live large house acquire work age. indeed, japan, share second-hand dwell total house market (i.e., combine new second-hand dwell together) 12 percent, far le 79 percent unite state 86 percent unite kingdom (chart 22). once house market reorganized, potential demand house cultivate meet different need different stage life, eventually invigorate relate markets, electric home appliance household items, well remodeling. change also desirable financial front. it often point that, japan, household financial asset concentrate cash deposits. this partly reflect share residential assets, is, real asset large price fluctuation low liquidity, among total household asset tend high (chart 23). if household asset start flow financial asset cash deposits, might enjoy increase supply long-term risk money. 3 for detail importance raise labor participation rate women, please see chad steinberg masato nakane, “can woman save japan?” imf work paper 12/248. international monetary fund, 2012. http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12248.pdf 4 in unite state since 1990, number employee manufacture decrease 6 million, mainly due acceleration shift production overseas, healthcare industry increase 6 million. 6 bi central bankers’ speech promote smooth transfer resource the third course promote smooth transfer resources. in medical care house area i talk about, shortfall demand mismatch demand supply become essence problem sense potential demand actual supply correspond other. in recent years, sale pre-packaged tour elderly sale health-related industry show mark increases. this suggest firm succeed cultivate potential demand make effort develop new product shift human resource capital businesses. change surely create new demand promote introduction new good services. it imperative realize optimal resource allocation shift labor capital resource within firm, well among firms, industries, regions, accordance change demand structure. in short, metabolic process also crucial achieve economic growth. look found year top 300 firm term market capitalization, firm long corporate history japan unite state (chart 24). this evidence firm make effort self-transform successfully manage cope series environmental changes. it also say dynamism absent term birth firms. change surely take place, however. for instance, look development stock market lehman shock, comparatively small firm recently perform relatively well (chart 25). the number initial public offer – show large decline recent year – gradually recovery trend, movement also observe outside large metropolitan areas. i quite encourage development. iv. regulatory institutional reforms, corporate governance reform, social value so far, i talk outline measure toward strengthen competitiveness growth potential. in principle, happen economy result individual firms’ rational choice. the fact happen reality must result economic, institutional, social factors. accordingly, need improve economic environment, i.e., remove obstruct factors. regulatory institutional reform first, need improvement, promote government, environment serve back firms’ effort aim bring change. more specifically, necessary government carry bold regulatory reform order firm broaden area may embark new challenges, make institutional improvement labor market allow worker move smoothly business industry high growth potential. in order avoid increase excessive social friction arise response change economic environment, also necessary provide support career change enhance safety net. corporate governance reform second, necessary ensure appropriate function corporate governance stockholder investors.5 on issue, germany good source reference. until 5 for detail effect various legal institution include corporate governance corporate profits, please see nobuyuki kinoshita, “the institutional background characteristic japanese firms’ include low profitability” (available japanese), imes discussion paper series 2012-j-12, institute monetary economic studies, bank japan, 2012. http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/papers/ japanese/12-j-12.pdf bi central bankers’ speech 7 begin 2000s, germany name country put essential structural reforms, country indeed suffer slow economic growth first half 2000s. under circumstances, however, engage various reform surround corporate activity, include institutional reform allow flexible adjustment employment well enhance information disclosure investors. on point, japan fall behind germany, especially come reform enterprise law area corporate rehabilitation, well merger acquisitions. this say hind dynamic corporate restructuring, thereby erode international competitiveness industry across board. it also say environment accentuate anxiousness legal liquidation remove fear take over, encourage extent excessive accumulation cash deposit firms. social value third, society need face possible trade-off stability change. japan somewhat dominate far perspective stress importance stability. the method add gradual “improvements” one’s company’s product accordance consumer need exist domestic market consider business management style put importance stability. merely make improvement focus domestic market amid population decline, however, carry risk economy fall shrink cycle. corporate profit suffer even long term firm continue keenly compete term price maintain commitment secure employment. if i may make sweep generalization, firm face judgment call choose “improvement”, represent continuity, “innovation”, represent discontinuity. if shock economy temporary, may point overcome difficulty immediate future via “improvements”, thus prioritize stability long term. confront long-lasting shock globalization population age mean “improvement” before, however, may delay response significant changes. reform cannot proceed without public consensus. bring innovation require firms’ willingness take challenge well transfer reallocation necessary resources. friction may well experience process. while necessarily issue one indisputable solution, environmental change long-lasting, i find extremely important society whole accept change adopt view encourage effort take new challenges, order successfully carry reform toward strengthen growth potential. v. relationship price so far, i talk effort strengthen economy’s competitiveness growth potential. next, get slightly track, i touch upon relationship economic growth prices. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) currently around 0 percent, expect reach 0.9 percent fiscal 2014, accord bank’s forecasts. this base view japan’s economy continue grow potential growth rate output gap filled, assume overseas economy moderately improve. however, consider fact output gap narrow significantly compare peak, give sensitivity price gap, close gap alone allow u reach target 2 percent right away. what general image economy achieve 2 percent inflation, mechanism behind process lead state? in theory, one come several cases. the first involve push rise import price result yen’s depreciation rise international commodity prices. the second relate rise wages. in medium long term, wage price closely correlated. the third see rise inflation 8 bi central bankers’ speech expectations. finally, fourth correspond rise growth expectation firm households. which case look for? in case import price push inflation, household real income squeezed. the ideal situation rise wages, rise inflation expectations, heighten firms’ households’ growth expectation take place time. what note relationship wage prices. one main factor behind low inflation rate japan relative economy japan’s employment practice. specifically, japanese society since second half 1990s prioritize secure employment, effect reduction cost largely cut back wages; consequently, price fell (chart 26). look development pattern corporate profits, wages, price economic recovery phases, three indicator move together direction high-growth era 1970s (chart 27). at present, neither wage price change materially even economic recovery phase, corporate profit act buff absorb shocks, labor distribution rate rise economic recession phase decline recovery periods. the primary cause decline firms’ profitability, turn reflect decline potential growth rate. on point, look relationship medium- long-term inflation expectation potential growth rates, clear positive correlation japan (chart 28). if firms’ households’ growth expectation improve, positive effect wage price sustainable manner. consequently, “deflationary expectations” take hold prolong period fade away. vi. the reform while generally recognize need work toward strengthen competitiveness growth potential, meet challenge essential overcome deflation achieve sustainable growth price stability, effort make progress? on point, key lie sense urgency regard need reform. the problem currently face japan’s economy, namely, rapid age population accompany issues, temporary. they steadily affect economy manner chronic illness. deterioration fiscal condition textbook example problems. in order maintain fiscal sustainability, necessary reform structure expenditure revenue well strengthen growth potential. unless growth rate rises, modest increase rate inflation alone barely improve fiscal balance. while chronic symptom exist japan, acute one appeared. the big reason lie fact japan hold massive amount external net asset reflect current account surplus continue prolong period. because this, japan tend experience inflow capital search safe haven, even event global economic shock, enjoy stable long-term interest rate face appreciation yen. japan experience sell-off currency crisis. in regard, i would like make reference recent development financial markets. the keywords understand movement global financial market last several year risk-on risk-off. when face great amount uncertainty future, investor stay away risk – words, become risk-off – uncertainty judge small, become risk-on (chart 29). the basic background yen’s appreciation last summer 2012 investors’ preference safe asset european debt problem intensified. indeed, late july yen hit recent peak nominal effective exchange rate spanish italian sovereign rate reach elevate levels. after that, variety safety valve cope european debt problem put place europe fiscal cliff avoid unite states. against background developments, global investors’ risk aversion substantially receded. broadly speaking, yen’s recent depreciation rise stock bi central bankers’ speech 9 price japan also take place amid change investors’ risk aversion. put differently, investors’ attitude toward risk may influence market conditions. i believe could easily understand look back fact yield government security member state euro area remain practically level nearly ten years. what ultimately drive market development economic fundamentals. over last 15 year japan, several phase yen depreciated. although export production increase phases, regrettably succeed raise potential growth rate (charts 30 31). the important thing make use current favorable condition make steady effort strengthen competitiveness growth potential economy. vii. conduct monetary policy bank japan lastly, i would like go recent monetary policy measure bank japan. a i mention outset, bank recognize inflation rate consistent price stability sustainable basis rise effort wide range entity toward strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy make progress. base recognition, monetary policy meet hold january, bank set announce “price stability target” 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi. a state bank japan act, bank conduct monetary policy base principle policy shall aim “achieving price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy”. put differently, bank aim achieve price stability japan’s economy grow sustainable balance manner, principle, bank pursue aggressive monetary ease aim achieve price stability target early possible time. the bank, asset purchase program, additionally purchase financial asset amount 36 trillion yen, mainly jgbs, end year. furthermore, january 2014 onward, purchase 13 trillion yen worth assets, 2 trillion yen jgbs, every month without set termination date. the bank commit pursuing, without loosen reins, aggressive monetary ease aim achieve “price stability target”. effort government, parallel appropriate monetary ease measures, important order overcome deflation early achieve sustainable growth price stability, follow reasons. first all, government’s effort strengthen competitiveness growth potential make progress, economic agent take advantage accommodative financial condition effect monetary ease increasingly amplified. at present, money, liquidity bank supplying, increase significantly; however, price respond accordingly (chart 32).6 private financial institution increase government bond hold rather lend (chart 33). on point, government state intention advance structural reform economy make use possible decisive policy actions, include carry bold regulatory institutional reforms. the bank expect forceful effort forthcoming regard. meanwhile, bank establish “loan support program” encourage proactive effort firm financial institutions, use lever finance.7 6 on point, chairman bernanke federal reserve state press conference december 12, 2012 “there’s effect inflation expectation size balance sheet”. for details, please see federal reserve board, “transcript chairman bernanke’s press conference”, december 12, 2012. http://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/fomcpresconf20121212.pdf 7 the bank establish “loan support program” integrate “growth support fund facility” introduce june 2010 “stimulating bank lend facility” introduce october 2012. 10 bi central bankers’ speech together aforementioned asset purchase program, bank supply additional fund amount 60 trillion yen next two years. the amount outstanding exceed 130 trillion yen, 30 percent nominal gdp (chart 34). while monetary ease central bank stimulate effect current economic condition bring forward tomorrow’s demand today, speak, effect wane become tomorrow unless demand day bring forward. at rate, size demand bring forward depend future growth potential. this make effort raise potential growth rate important. if effort bank financial side government strengthen growth potential could instigate virtuous cycle bring synergies, policy effect likely amplified. second, order pursue aggressive monetary easing, ensure confidence regard fiscal policy also important. a part monetary easing, bank purchase substantial amount government bonds. give severe fiscal conditions, however, purchase regard monetize government debt market home abroad, risk long-term interest rate would rise. in particular, effort strengthen growth potential make progress bank’s hold jgbs continue increase, risk become imminent. be occur, would effect monetary ease weaken, would also adverse effect real economy impact business financial institution hold large amount government bonds.8 in sense, discipline expect government bank. discipline within bank stipulate purpose impose central bank, is, contribute sustainable growth price stability financial system stability. meanwhile, government require uphold fiscal discipline. on point, government state clearly “will steadily promote measure aim establish sustainable fiscal structure view ensure credibility fiscal management”. once credibility erode economy fall state confusion, limit room maneuver central bank. economist generally refer kind situation “fiscal dominance”. in order prevent situation materializing, important engage effort achieve fiscal reform, thereby maintain fiscal discipline medium long term. final remark while active discussion regard conduct economic policy japan, i personally feel need earnestly discus truly want achieve refer “overcoming deflation”, must carry order accomplish this. the opportunity right front u now. once find want, must take action. the bank continue utmost toward overcome deflation early achieve sustainable growth price stability. the purpose central bank lay stable economic financial foundation support sustainable growth economy.9 in so, go without say bank thoroughly examine outlook economic activity price risk factor sustainable growth. independent central 8 on relationship fiscal sustainability financial system stability, well price stability, please see masaaki shirakawa, “the importance fiscal sustainability: precondition stability financial system prices” (remarks banque de france financial stability review launch event washington d.c.), april 21, 2012.

tokyo), january 25, 2013. http://www.boj.or.jp/ en/announcements/press/koen_2013/data/ko130130a.pdf bi central bankers’ speech 11 bank obviously expect explain effect well cost measure long term. i believe accountability means. a experience global credit bubble mid-2000s suggests, time again, seed new problem unexpected crisis already sow authority respond problem. this provide u renew sense awareness importance humility learn history stability medium- long-term perspective. the bank japan continue listen variety view conduct monetary policy appropriately judgment responsibility policy board aim overcome deflation early achieve sustainable economic growth price stability. i ask continue support. thank attention. 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 13 14 bi

reserve bank australia, australian institute building, sydney, 14 march 2013. * * * i would like thank the australian institute build invitation speak today opportunity discus recent development house market. house important life many ways, include secure place live, key asset important vehicle saving. house also source employment lot people, include business developing, build renovating, well help u trade move dwellings, oversee legalities, insurance finance housing-related transactions. hardly surprise it’s frequent topic conversation, include among economists. and surprise central banker pay close attention, give play important role business cycle, transmission monetary policy and, we’ve see many advance economy late, health financial system. my plan today add conversation, review what’s happen past year two discuss factor affect outlook australian house market. the establish house market overall, data recent month suggest demand establish house market strengthen gradually, help underpin moderate growth dwell construction. this general strengthen helped, doubt, 175 basis point worth cut cash rate since late 2011, decline mortgage interest rate follow cuts.1 apart brief period onset global financial crisis, require mortgage payment new home low level share disposable income past decade (graph 1). an assessment what’s happen house price depend somewhat market look time period. for country whole, house price rise gradually since may 2012, 4 per cent high time (graph 2). however, developer make plan purchase land development around october 2010, house price last peaked, might forgive focus fact house price still previous peak many locations. in particular, price still quite way peak brisbane melbourne, price quite flat year adelaide outside capital city mainland states. with interest rate low house price pick much country, people confident either house price keep rise least decline. we see available survey measure house price expectations. this important prospective entrant market, particularly developer investors, might otherwise wary undertake new venture purchase house 1 standard variable house loan rate decline 135 basis point average since late 2011, bank fund cost rise relative cash rate. the board rba take account monetary policy decision result, cash rate low otherwise would been. see lowe p (2012), “what normal?”, address australian business economist annual dinner, 5 december. 2 bi central bankers’ speech fear capital loss. but again, market across country boat. in melbourne, example, question whether supply move ahead demand, particularly market apartment inner-city area. this possibility certainly consistent fact price house unit melbourne quite bite low peak early 2011. the general improvement sentiment also apparent auction clearance rates. after fall sharply 2011, rate recover around average level sydney melbourne late 2012 appear increase early year. this move may part help tendency vendor adopt realistic expectations, evidence rise vendor discount – is, extent property sell list price. these discount rise gradually market weaken 2011; recently, degree vendor discount return normal levels. despite improvement condition establish house market, turnover remain quite low, least comparison previous decade (graph 3). however, may experience era right comparison. perhaps shouldn’t expect see turnover sustain high rate again. if right, mean make live turnover – real estate agent obvious example – unlikely see return easy day first half previous decade. finance over past 20 year so, upturn house market accompany increase growth rate credit. but year also period structural change economy move high level household indebtedness (graph 4). generation household yet buy first home, still want trade up, take advantage easy access credit, among thing facilitate shift low inflation low interest rate early 1990s.2 a part change, household save rate decline house price increased, time quite rapidly. with household indebtedness long move since 2006, long period adjustment seem run course. indeed, recent year see rise household save rate relatively stable household debt share income. this suggest expect house credit grow anywhere near rapidly previous upturns. moreover, recent pick-up house price would tend imply growth house loan – since buyer typically fund purchase debt – effect lessen low level turnover establish house market. even so, availability credit appear constraint homebuyers investors. the decline mortgage interest rate since 2011 underpin moderate increase value total house loan approval past six month (graph 5). this drive demand repeat-buyer owner-occupier well investors.3 despite moderate pick-up new lending, growth house credit increase significantly remain broadly line growth income annual rate around 4½ per cent. low interest rate give household scope make payment 2 for detail adjustment high level household indebtedness, see bloxham p, c kent m

change government grant tax exemptions. these change significantly increase assistance purchase new dwell relative establish dwell states. bi central bankers’ speech 3 mortgage ahead schedule. this mean give growth rate new lending, credit growth bite low otherwise. we see effect behaviour owner-occupier house credit. from early 2012, shortly mortgage rate start decline, owner-occupier house credit grow slow pace investor house credit (graph 6). this make sense incentive make excess mortgage payment great owner-occupier investor give different tax incentive face. while finance available household relatively favourable terms, developer continue report difficulty obtain finance new construction, bank require high proportion pre-sales typical prior global financial crisis. accord reserve bank’s industry liaison, large developer good reputation strong balance sheet access credit, small developer tend experience difficulty borrow funds. dwell investment the availability relatively low cost finance home purchaser combine improve condition establish house market support dwell construction recent quarters. the expectation dwell investment continue pick here. however, hard know strong pick-up likely be. private residential build approvals, though volatile, pick noticeably trough early 2012 (graph 7). this recovery drive increase higher-density approvals, mainly apartments, see large states. across almost every major region sydney, build approval since mid-2012 high previous five year (graph 8). in melbourne approval also pick up, though somewhat le across regions. there pick-up approval western australia, although change build approval process state around middle last year make difficult discern underlie trends. approval queensland subdued, particularly gold coast south-east state generally; however, even builder region indicate u tentative sign improvement demand recently. while build approval higher-density house pick up, yet little sign rise approval detach houses.4 indeed, build approval detach house currently level see low point previous cyclical downturns, approval higher-density house at, even above, previous cyclical peaks. this may early indication new trend house market. there number reason might so. first, price land increase relative income past decades, make sense incentive economise use land – is, live higher-density housing. second, may utility live detach house fringe many city decrease increase congestion difficulty travel city access job opportunity there. the third closely relate possibility may shift people’s preference towards live close centre city exist infrastructure there. in case, durable, structural change market, important implication builder developers, particularly whose business model focus detach housing. to understand strength increase overall residential construction activity likely be, helpful take step back recent months’ worth data 4 also, alteration addition continue fall. the low level dwell turnover may help explain weakness level renovation activity. this people sell dwelling, buy dwelling, often undertake work sort. 4 bi central bankers’ speech look development long period. the thing really stand past year that, despite recent pick-up, dwell investment share economy remain close trough decade ago (graph 9). this relatively low level dwell construction raise question whether demand particularly weak whether supply issue constrain construction activity. factor affect supply land development obviously important bear cost new housing, speed increase demand house accommodate rise construction. i’ll come back discussion factor minute. but key point i want make whatever supply-side constraint might be, don’t seem prevent increase construction across much country 2009 2010. at time, general increase incentive first home buyer (for new exist dwellings), support provide time low interest rates, lead sharp run-up construction new south wales, queensland, victoria western australia (graph 10). further evidence supply land whole story find look across different region within states. if supply critical constraint, might expect construction trend different across inner out part city regional area beyond cities. for example, development out suburb tend greenfield land, development inner suburb tend higher-density dwell brownfield land. however, victoria least, pick-up build activity 2009 2010 relatively broad base across different area (graph 11). for new south wales, appear large sustain pick-up approval inner middle region sydney, out sydney rest state. this may reflect limitation access land sydney’s fringes, nonetheless, relatively rapid pick-up approval 2009. even so, doesn’t mean supply-side issue important bear house sector. this point make research publish one bank’s bulletin article last year.5 many public report bank’s liaison industry participant point range supply-side impediment australian house market. these include length complexity plan process, provision fund infrastructure, land ownership geographical constraints, well challenge development within city region already well developed. while factor may impose constraint cost responsiveness new supply, le clear restrain level new construction past. one way often use ass possible outlook dwell construction compare number dwell build period time measure term “underlying demand”. the notion ass prospect average number people live household, gauge strength “underlying demand” look what’s happen population growth. the problem sort analysis average number people household change time response range things, include cost housing. over 20th century, demographic social factors, decline birth rate rise separation rate, accommodate growth dwell stock outpace population. in words, downward trend number people household (graph 12). a similar change also evident across advance economies. however, past decade so, trend abate we’ve see average household size stabilise. indeed, high level house price rent (relative 5 see hsieh w, d norman d orsmond (2012), “supply-side issue house sector”, rba bulletin, september, pp 11–19. bi central bankers’ speech 5 incomes) may somewhat constraint household formation therefore demand new housing. this lead i think arguably good way judge strength demand versus supply, look price rent doing. what suggest demand show sign strengthen relative supply. in particular, house price long decline relative income (graph 13). also, rental market appear relatively tight. vacancy rate quite low since 2006 comparison average since early 1990s, (with small delay) lead rent rise relative income remain relatively stable around level see previous cyclical peak (graph 14). the growth rent also mean condition investor become favourable, (gross) rental yield increase across capital cities. our liaison house industry confirm demand new house positive recent months. at time, however, contact note condition still remain relatively subdue states. in particular, report price construction new dwell hold response weak demand, discount still report across market, include new developments. not surprisingly, developer find lack buyer urgency early period decline dwell prices. in addition, note instance early sale make plan fall ahead settlement, apparently due caution lender regard valuation strict lend practice new developments. summary let conclude draw thread together. a range indicator suggest low interest rate support establish house market, price move high many markets, though remain early peak most. also, finance available reasonable term households. with condition place, dwell construction begin pick lead indicator point growth month ahead. in line this, expectation gradual increase dwell construction activity year next. this moderate growth dwell investment play role help support gradual pick-up economic growth broadly expect rate little trend year. but hard know exactly strong recovery house market might be, we’ll continue analyse development closely period ahead. 6 bi central bankers’ speech graph 1 graph 2 bi central bankers’ speech 7

fx award ceremony 2013, bangkok, 27 march 2013. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 1. it honour join thomson reuters 2013 fx award ceremony today. i would like take opportunity congratulate winner fx award year thank market participants, well thomson reuters, contribution development thai foreign exchange market. for winner award year, one remind award give outstanding achievement business grounds, also recognition notable effort enhance market efficiency. so hearty congratulation job well done! 2. a know, much happen past years, global level within thai economy. the global economy show sign improvements, although measure pace, reaction financial market seem run ahead development grounds. for many u see global economy financial market many business cycles, euphoria exuberance expect whenever global risk sentiment improve investment strategy shift toward risk- taking. today, new theme so-called “the great rotation”, take center stage. however, turnaround may lead new concern challenge go forward. today’s event thus provide opportune occasion u deliberate exchange view topical issue. 3. although late economic data point strong growth momentum small tail risks, uncertainty short-term threat still remain. for example, situation europe easily come back take centre stage thus provide reality check point reminder structural problem take time resolve. besides, anti-austerity pressure could delay ongoing reform efforts. this may, time time, raise uncertainty spark volatility market. meanwhile, improve economic outlook u need temper reality fiscal drag near-term risk spend cut come back hit market sentiment. thus, proceed care since market somewhat overly price global recovery story. 4. the challenge great rotation view two dimensions. first, risk preference shift safety risky asset improve global sentiment. particularly, global stock market rally far beyond modest global recovery. this see msci world index surge almost 25% last 9 month global growth remain low level. 5. rally stock price back optimistic sentiment may sow seed potential bubble. although market realize rise asset price would virtually compress yield, market appear le concern bubble asset prices. therefore, risk sharp correction witness recent episode thai stock market last week. 6. the second dimension great rotation global fund flow, one great challenge emerge market experiencing. the continue monetary ease advance economies, economic growth differential protract low interest rate environment key factor push investor search yield; fund flow therefore switch

area work, offer considerable scope research. my scheme presentation follows. first, i begin give snapshot evolution monetary framework india contextualise short-term interest rate emerge key operate objective monetary policy. second, i briefly focus debate rule versus discretion conduct monetary policy. third, i present simple taylor rule estimate india cover recent period 2001–2013 reflect great use interest rate instrument monetary policy. i conclude think way forward. monetary policy operation let briefly highlight evolution monetary policy operate framework india, place discussion interest rate rule perspective. in india, countries, monetary policy framework evolve response consequence financial developments, openness shift underlie transmission mechanism. the evolution monetary policy framework india see phases. in formative year 1935–1950, focus monetary policy regulate supply demand credit economy bank rate, reserve requirement open market operation (omo). in development phase 1951–1970, monetary policy gear towards support plan financing. this lead introduction several quantitative control measure contain consequent inflationary pressures. while ensure credit prefer sectors, bank rate often use monetary policy instrument. during 1971–90, focus monetary policy credit planning. both statutory liquidity ratio (slr) cash reserve ratio (crr) use balance government finance attendant inflationary pressure. subsequently, structural reform financial liberalisation 1990s shift finance paradigm government commercial sector increasingly market-determined interest rate exchange rate. by second half 1990s, liquidity management operations, reserve bank able move away direct instrument indirect market-based instruments. start april 1999, reserve bank introduce full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (laf). it operate overnight fix rate repo reverse repo november 2004. this process help develop interest rate instrument monetary transmission. this framework reinforce may 2011 weight average overnight call money rate explicitly recognise operate target monetary policy repo rate make one independently vary policy rate (mohanty, 2011)1. 1 mohanty, deepak (2011): “how reserve bank india conduct monetary policy?” reserve bank india bulletin, september. 2 bi central bankers’ speech chart 1: the new laf framework base explicit interest rate target the new operate framework illustrate chart 1 modify laf assign great weight interest rate channel monetary transmission. this mean reserve bank change policy repo rate, quickly impact overnight interest rate operational rate transmit term structure interest rate well bank lend rates. increase importance channel also evident mix instrument policy actions. over years, comparison crr, use interest rate instrument repo rate reserve bank frequent, except year 2008–09, peak global financial crisis (chart 2). bi central bankers’ speech 3 rule versus discretion a reserve bank start explicitly target overnight interest rate operational objective instrument policy repo rate, relevant question arise: how interest rate determined? should broadly follow rule base central bank’s discretion? the debate rule versus discretion old monetary economics. this issue receive add impetus monetary system transit gold standard fiat money. when kydland prescott (1977) seminal article present time inconsistency argument favour rules, debate become even sharper2. subsequently, taylor (1993) demonstrate even practical world monetary policy making, monetary policy reaction function could model predetermine rule superior policy outcome3. let briefly touch upon pro con rule-based monetary policy turn formulation taylor rule. a number reason advance literature rule-based monetary policy could effective. first, rule towards credible commitment central bank maintain price stability reduce inflation bias monetary policy. second, rule enhance economic efficiency reduce uncertainty future policy. third, rule help policymakers avoid pressure special interest group facilitate action consistent long-run goals. fourth, rule facilitate communication, promote transparency increase accountability. similarly, argument application rules. first, economic system complex characterize rule. second, rule may work business cycle. third, rule-based policy reduce flexibility respond exogenous shocks. fourth, rule allow policy surprise may desirable policy effectiveness certain circumstances. fifth, rule ill suit develop economy characterize underdevelop financial market rapid structural transformation. in practice, difficult come across central banks, explicitly spell policy rules. however, modern central banks, empirical assessment policy evaluation increasingly base rule ever since taylor’s influential paper. in empirical work, original taylor rule modify extend variety way adapt specific country set evolve monetary framework. these include forward-looking taylor rule, taylor-mccallum type rule, non-linear framework address asymmetric behavior monetary policy time-varying nature parameters. taylor rule taylor rule interest rate feedback rule central bank set short-term interest rate achieve objective stabilize economy achieve price stability economic condition fluctuate. this could express as: 2 kydland, finn e. prescott (1977): “rules rather discretion: the inconsistency optimal plans”, journal political economy, 85 (3), 473–492. 3 taylor, j.b. (1993): “discretion versus policy rule practice”, carnegie-rochester conference series public policy, 39, 195–214. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the rule recommend short-term interest rate change accord deviation inflation predetermine target output potential level. essentially, combination inflation output gap determine appropriate policy rate would return economy potential level without cause inflation. if goal conflict sense inflation target economy grow potential vice versa, rule provide guidance balance compete consideration set appropriate level policy interest rate. while β γ could estimate data, taylor assume 0.5 each. in sense assign equal weight inflation growth objectives. this reasonable assumption consider central bank concern inflation growth. these dual objective build many central bank statutes, include us. he also additionally assume desire level inflation u 2 per cent per annum equilibrium real policy rate 2 per cent per annum. taylor (1993) show simple monetary policy rule, u feed raise interest rate inflation rate exceed 2 per cent implicit target real gdp growth high potential, describe quite well actual path feed fund rate 1987 1992. the linear framework taylor rule is, however, criticize many grind central bank asymmetric preference interest rate smooth depend direction monetary policy stance. in addition change discretionary rule-based policy regimes, economic theory provide several reason deviate sometimes symmetric linear policy rule framework (gerlach, 2000)4. an accept way represent behaviour literature assume actual interest rate gradually adjust desire rate as: ίt = ρit-1 +(1-ρ) ίt*, capture observe smooth policy rate central bank, i.e., smooth parameter. substitute original taylor rule formulation (1), modify taylor rule smooth take form as: it may note equation (2) linear parameter hence parameter ρ, α, β γ estimate observe data non-linear least square method. 4 gerlach, s., (2000): “asymmetric policy reaction inflation”, work paper, bank international settlements. bi central bankers’ speech 5 estimate india in india much research monetary policy rule partly underlie monetary framework largely rely direct quantity base instruments. moreover, commercial interest rate structure highly regulate till recently. in indian context, singh (2010) estimate taylor rule use annual data period 1950–2009 observe shift policy response towards inflation gap since 1990s.5 patra kapur (2012) estimate forward-looking exchange rate augment taylor rule find high degree interest rate smoothing.6 empirical estimation taylor rule require priori determination three parameters: desire level inflation, potential output equilibrium real policy rate. these parameter country-specific, hence need estimated. first, mid-1980s chakravarty committee (1985)7 suggest tolerable level inflation 4.0 per cent per annum facilitate change relative price necessary attract resource growth sectors. the reserve bank’s current assessment suggest threshold level inflation india range 4.4–5.7 per cent, imply mid-point rate 5.0 per cent (subbarao, 2013).8 draw research reserve bank, desire level inflation rate term year-on-year variation wholesale price index (wpi) assume 5.0 per cent. the actual inflation rate, however, remain threshold level post-crisis period (chart 3). chart 3: inflation post-crisis period

2012–13 (chart 4). chart 4: potential output estimate moderate post-crisis period third, determination neutral real policy rate complex issue observe real time. one way derive comprehensive general equilibrium model indian economy. another simpler, though satisfactory, way derive taylor rule estimate itself. the empirical estimate two alternative taylor rule estimate u suggest range 0.5–0.9 per

australia, along 10 jurisdictions, adopt capital element basel iii 1 january year. some major jurisdiction – eu u particular – little behind, though bcbs member jurisdiction least release draft

central bankers’ speech 1 már guðmundsson: recent economic financial development iceland speech mr már guðmundsson, governor central bank iceland, 52nd annual general meet central bank iceland, reykjavík 21 march 2013. * * * madame prime minister; ministers; madame chairman; director ambassadors; lady gentlemen: a convene 52nd annual general meet central bank iceland, domestic economic recovery begin mid-2010 continues, although slow recent months. at least degree, slowdown due development internationally. the margin spare capacity economy continue narrow. inflation prove persistent previously hoped, however. early on, wage increase far excess productivity growth play lead role raise inflation well inflation target, since last autumn weaken króna, trigger deteriorate term trade heavy foreign debt service burden, play great part. monetary policy respond development interest rate increase begin august 2011. the bank’s interest rate unchanged since november, however, intervention foreign exchange market support exchange rate recent term, thereby support monetary policy goal bring inflation back target. global output growth lose pace 2012, differ degree various regions. there contraction euro area marginal growth uk elsewhere europe. among iceland’s major trade partners, weight output growth measure 0.8% 2012, oppose 1.7% 2011. to degree, capital control shield icelandic financial system euro area crisis. the effect felt external trade unavoidable, however, iceland’s term trade deteriorate course year, import purchase power export revenue stagnated. this play part slow output growth, even though iceland’s growth rate much fast trade partner countries. accord preliminary figure statistic iceland 2012 whole, output growth measure 1.6% year, somewhat central bank’s february forecast 2.2%. on hand, year-2011 growth figure revise upwards, 2.6% 2.9%. this well line central bank’s first forecast gdp growth 2011. it uncommon output growth figure revise upwards upward cycles, detail investment figure become available. it interest see estimate 2012 develop. output growth 2012 drive growth private consumption business investment, items, net trade public consumption, make slightly negative contribution. this similar whole recovery phase 2010–2012, business investment private consumption contribute output growth le equally, business investment hold slight advantage. last year’s growth sound sense “borrowed” base underlie current account surplus measure almost 4% gdp. in spite slowdown gdp growth last year, slack economy continue diminish. the economic recovery continuing, current forecast provide gdp growth 2% year 3½–4% range 2014 2015. labour market statistic support forecast diminish slack economy. for instance, seasonally adjust unemployment measure 4½% labour force february, low point since november 2008. a survey carry regularly central bank collaboration confederation icelandic employer show that, first time 2 bi central bankers’ speech since march 2008, respondent wish recruit staff member outnumber interest downsizing. the slack economy still exists, developments, together disappoint inflation figure (which i mention late on), give rise question big slack is. every time take decision interest rates, monetary policy decision-makers must ask question, previous economic policy mistake iceland elsewhere – mistake end inflation instability – often originate overestimation output slack potential output growth. it vital seek structural reform could result high growth potential, important work direction currently underway. but equally important give rise unrealistic expectation fast potential output grow. the central bank’s analysis forecast work always aim answer question, one important monetary policy implementation. inflation subside somewhat 2012, fall 6½% begin year 4% year-end. the bank’s february forecast assume trend would continue, provide króna weaken further. accord forecast, inflation close target around middle next year. whether happen early late depend primarily development exchange rate. it therefore disappointment see much price rise february, raise twelve-month inflation again. it always imprudent read much individual measurements, yet come light much increase base temporary factors. furthermore, exchange rate rise 5% since begin year, could affect next measurements. nonetheless, inflation measurement give good reason caution, role temporary factor prof small might appear present inflation decline target slowly previously forecast, necessary, thing equal, withdraw monetary accommodation sooner would otherwise required. the central bank’s interest rate unchanged since november 2012, raise 0.25 percentage points. in november statement, monetary policy committee imply bank’s nominal rate could remain unchanged come month development line forecast additional pay rise negotiate wage settlement review early year. this bear far, committee keep rate unchanged december, february, march meetings. at present, central bank’s effective real interest rate positive 1%. although rise nearly 2 percentage point past year, still equilibrium real rate economy recover slack disappeared. if economic recovery maintain pace come months, therefore necessary withdraw accommodative monetary stance still further. the pace happen depend economic developments, degree normalisation take place high nominal central bank rate depend future development inflation. towards end last year past several weeks, central bank sell foreign currency interbank market. the bank also announce temporarily suspend programme weekly foreign currency purchases. these measure approve extraordinary meet monetary policy committee early january. the intervention measure amount 7 b.kr., include 4 b.kr. year. in comparison, bank net buyer foreign currency amount 60 b.kr. 2010–2012, foreign currency purchase make considerably low exchange rate recent sales. furthermore, 19 february bank conclude forward currency swap agreement landsbankinn amount 6 b.kr., mean landsbankinn need accumulate foreign currency comply bank’s foreign exchange balance requirements. the monetary policy committee opinion intervention type justifiable order mitigate temporary exchange rate volatility address effectively bi central bankers’ speech 3 instrument interest rates. in recent weeks, foreign exchange market characterise unusual combination features: weaken term trade, foreign exchange accumulation anticipation heavy foreign debt service, foreign exchange mismatch banks’ balance sheet and, part, self-fulfilling expectation currency depreciation. because condition part temporary increase foreign exchange inflow expect spring advances, limit one-off foreign currency sale central bank consider appropriate prevent excessive currency depreciation stem tide self-fulfilling expectation market participants. this consistent strategy outline bank’s report monetary policy after capital controls, publish late 2010. capital control impose early winter 2008 part government’s imf programme. in addition change expiry date controls, major amendment make twice: october 2009, cross-border transfer krónur prohibit outflow derive new investment liberalised; march 2012, exemption central bank iceland require disbursement fail banks. parliament pass amendment foreign exchange act, broad-based support members. the central bank participate draft amendment support it. the amendment create strong foundation work lie ahead find solution settlement banks’ estate consistent monetary exchange rate stability facilitate large step liberalise controls. the bank also welcome enhance understand nature capital control fact necessary evil, reflect consensus issue. the aim control arrest decline króna, provide shelter restructure private sector debt financial system whole, create space economic policy mitigate recession ultimately support recovery. in broad terms, goal realised. without controls, much strict monetary policy would require early stage crisis. the treasury would much le scope mitigate contraction 2009, domestic finance deficit would much expensive. in context, worth note that, average, real interest rate new domestic treasury borrow negative almost half percentage point 2009–2012. but stabilisation gain capital control diminish time. the capital control also efficiency cost associate – cost probably modest start increase time. there little research high cost present, assertion effect well founded. it still difficult make quantitative assessment risk accompany liberalisation controls, presumably great fast control lift economy le prepare it. from theoretical standpoint, lift control moment present value future efficiency cost exceed present value future stabilisation gains, include risk accompany speedy liberalisation. that precise moment never identify certainty, however, although sign indicate come yet, arrived, rapid liberalisation would underway. at point, likely benefit lift control gradually still great cost retain little longer. the pivotal issue tool give u order prevent settlement fail bank jeopardise financial stability. but none change fact must lift control soon safe so, economic cost retain iceland’s international obligations. in speech year ago, i say one complex task face icelandic authority time. that changed. a prerequisite success base effort best possible analysis problem potential solution it. until now, control view provide shelter 4 bi central bankers’ speech resolution balance payment problem cause collapse financial system. if non-residents’ potentially volatile claim resident pay short period time, iceland would pay foreign debt much rapidly desirable. if bad come worst, deleveraging could amount roughly half iceland’s gdp relatively years. under circumstances, króna would depreciate significantly, least considerable period time, banks’ liquidity would weakened, public sector finance would likewise. domestic foreign treasury finance would much difficult expensive come by. but analysis correct? be iceland face balance payment refinance problem rather debt sustainability problem? the difference two lie fact household, firm, national treasury, nation face debt sustainability problem cannot service debt available revenue surplus matter long debt stretch out. then debt relative income rise without limits. in case, three solutions: increase revenue surpluses, reduction debt, reduction interest rates. on hand, payment refinance problem exist long loan duration would eliminate temporary debt service shortfalls. but two proviso must make here. first all, boundary two always clear. unlimited loan duration available. a sustain refinance problem lead default debt sustainability problem. it also change debt sustainability problem interest rate rise steeply upon refinancing. second all, nation’s debt different nature debt individual. a nation consist numerous legal entities, cannot handle debt, need severe consequence part whole, provide sovereign involved. under flexible exchange rate regime, national debt service excess surplus also cause currency depreciate surplus grow. but process without limits. early week, central bank publish report iceland’s underlie external position, address question whether iceland face debt sustainability problem balance payment problem i define them. but order answer question, necessary peer settlement estate result financial crisis – process nowhere near completion – correct effect certain international corporation operate country. these company profound effect iceland’s international investment position measure accord international standards, would negligible impact state domestic economy default debt. a result, task require great deal estimation entail uncertainty, previous find shown. the estimate reliable before, however, time clarify number factor concern fail banks’ estate analyst gain access best available data. the result previous appraisals, however, sign debt sustainability problem i define it. iceland’s net underlie debt position estimate 60% gdp, low since 1999. furthermore, low many country one would claim face sustainability problem. new zealand’s net debt position, instance, hover around 80% one decade. base outlook iceland’s underlie trade balance prospect domestic output growth, would sufficient reduce debt position 18 percentage point gdp 2017. consider uncertainty estimate, likely net external debt position lay range 35–80% gdp year-end 2012. but upper end range enough create debt sustainability problem as, even case, iceland’s debt still continue decline period. in addition, note estimate assume current stock offshore krónur assess onshore exchange rate fail banks’ isk asset assess nearly full book value onshore exchange rate. that case, course. in order gain perspective amount involved, useful note 25% reduction valuation follow sale asset estate expatriation bi central bankers’ speech 5 iceland reduce measure debt position full six percentage point gdp. the final figure much large this, course. be problem, then? yes, is. the report show balance payment problem could become substantial year domestic access foreign capital refinance improve. it estimate surplus underlie current account balance year – 4% gdp – exclude estate fail bank effect pharmaceutical company actavis. iceland could therefore reduce net external debt amount. the problem is, however, calculation show bank’s report assume surplus could contract come year may even turn deficit time rise foreign debt service borrower without access foreign refinancing. if party gain access market acceptable term near future, capital inflow forthcoming, significant downward pressure icelandic króna inevitable. weigh heavily context debt owe new landsbankinn old bank. negotiation concern possible lengthen maturity debt underway. it possible argue outlook base extremely pessimistic assumptions. market access already open up, arion bank’s recent foreign borrow show. the calculation bank’s report assume foreign interest rate return pre-crisis level years, sign present. it also assume import ratio return pre-crisis levels. the central bank examine additional scenario possible development balance payment come years, development market access come month significant effect outlook. in spite proviso necessity present unrealistically pessimistic scenario could undermine confidence needlessly, scenario go far, must determine prevent outcome. economic policy structural reform must ensure iceland’s competitive position deteriorate expect follow normal rise real exchange rate historically low levels, give current account surplus work way bulk debt. it important public sector finance well surplus period attempt make ensure high level national save prevail iceland crisis. furthermore, clear scope use current account surplus release non-residents’ isk asset extremely limit come years. how likely it, then, lift capital control next years? obviously, would much easy new capital inflow forthcoming, either new foreign borrow foreign direct investment. in addition, clear decisive step take lift control suitable solution find settlement fail banks’ estates. that solution could take many forms, would affect subsequent approach lift controls. a revise liberalisation strategy would therefore look quite different depend route choose settlement fail banks’ estates. a solution problem must therefore come first. i won’t discus possibility great length here, great deal work lie ahead, would unwise show hand point. furthermore, necessary one option hand, case one seem best outset prof infeasible late on. it possible, however, make comment enhance general understand need happen. if portion estate settle composition agreements, key importance isk asset recovery add little possible (or nothing all) stock volatile isk asset own non-residents. it important bear mind sell bank relatively low price foreign investor interest short term handsome dividend payment solve problem could even exacerbate it. 6 bi central bankers’ speech it role estate divest asset make payment creditors. the question is, however, realistic price assets, exchange rate convert foreign currency. that depend want buy will able bring necessary currency, cannot come export revenue bank’s foreign exchange reserves. in lift capital controls, face question far will go. shall return way thing crash? history show iceland generally do best maintain open business tie rest world. iceland alone regard, course, history economic theory show international trade generally enhance well-being. this also true capital transactions. but also fact severe financial crisis small, open economy like iceland originate, least part, excessively volatile capital flow country, foster debt accumulation asset bubble upswings shut main downward cycle. unrestricted capital flow thus couple benefit also risk. this risk mitigate sound economic policy appropriate regulatory supervisory framework, never disappear entirely. consequently, number sign that, contrary generally accept idea free trade good services, financial integration outside world actually go far. this support study indicate “thresholds” term benefit financial integration form matters. for instance, foreign direct investment usually jeopardise economic stability, short-term movement carry trade riskier. it argue iceland go far financial integration year financial crisis. in part this, central bank recommended, 2012 report entitle prudential rule follow capital controls, capital control lifted, restriction place financial firms’ foreign exchange risk ability expand foreign currency balance sheet associate maturity mismatches. restriction would also place foreign-denominated borrow households, firms, municipality without income borrow currencies. these idea develop honed, could implement entry force new liquidity foreign exchange balance rule central bank intend issue year. it say reassessment monetary policy framework must take place capital control lift full. this perhaps critical might seem, however, country unrestricted capital flow various kind monetary policy framework. nonetheless, necessary review monetary policy, bank publish report topic recent term, one entitle monetary policy after capital control entitle iceland’s currency exchange rate policy options. in addition, could number policy formulation task ahead central bank beyond scope speech today, financial system structure – include question extent restriction place maturity mismatch financial institutions’ balance sheet system’s public good element protect leverage speculation. honour guests: in closing, i would like thank central bank’s many collaborator successful co-operative relationship past year. first among ministry bank work closely – particular,

address mr jwala rambarran, governor central bank trinidad tobago, sixty third annual general meet telephone workers’ credit union co-operative society limited, port spain, 16 march 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, i sincerely thank board telephone workers’ credit union kind invitation deliver feature address sixty third annual general meeting. it indeed honour part occasion. in june 1950, telephone workers’ credit union open door 38 member share capital $51. sixty three year later, boast membership excess 5,000 resource base nearly $415 million. this endure journey build wealth generation member certainly testimony significant resilience telephone workers’ credit union clear indication live motto “progress self reliance”. in fact, i aware credit union whose journey broadly similar telephone workers’ credit union boast achievements. for reason, i want underscore central bank recognize important contribution credit union make society, especially reach ordinary work men woman underserved traditional financial institutions. indeed, i find fit tribute global credit union movement, always stress brotherhood man that, new pope know concern poor, choose first time name saint francis assisi, whose prayer widely recognize official prayer credit union worldwide. for 65 years, credit union movement trinidad tobago put ideal brotherhood man practice socio-economic field. credit union help member develop save habit, educate financial matters, finance small business start ups, even experience considerable turbulence consolidation. today, one-third population member credit union collectively manage $9.5 billion assets, almost 4 percent total asset entire financial system. in effect, lady gentlemen, credit union movement contribute financial deepen trinidad tobago economy, bring financial service close members, family communities. and this, turn, encourage great financial inclusion i commend local credit union movement. nonetheless, growth development credit union sector take place within legislative framework provide formal prudential regulation supervision. a know, present legislation govern credit union movement – co-operative society act – date back 1971 fall short prudential framework protect members’ save help safeguard integrity domestic financial system. i remind insightful word independent senator subas ramkhelawan contribution last december debate security industry bill. senator ramkhelawan indicate “financial regulation whole like build fortress, important build fortress wall must equally fortified, marauder gate always look weak point infiltrate”. 2 bi central bankers’ speech we indeed see marauder gate, breach fortress regulation, insurance credit union sectors. and still experience painful emotional financial cost citizen economy. accordingly, i would like take opportunity morning speak issue relate new propose regulatory regime credit unions, expect come effect sometime second half 2013. • first, i explain central bank prudential regulator credit union trinidad tobago; • second, i wish highlight key principle underlie propose credit union regulatory regime, fundamental difference co-operative society act draft credit union bill; • finally, i address linger concern national credit union movement. prudential regulation credit union sector central bank lady gentlemen, many would recall cabinet decision july 2005 bring credit union regulatory authority central bank initially meet disquiet credit union movement. this uneasiness, perhaps rightly time, stem fear central bank really understand unique character credit union would unfairly treat like banks. the fact original proposal bring credit union regulatory authority central bank envisage division movement asset size little ease fears. i please see come long way past decade. the central bank certainly appreciative understand special nature credit union value democracy, volunteerism, member equality participation, member education training, community development. a far i judge, today credit union movement whole strongly supportive need specific legislation recognize special characteristic credit unions, support rationale behind central bank prudential regulator entire credit union sector. of course, still view increase resource improve skillsets office commissioner co-operatives well effect amendment exist cooperative society act suffice regulate credit union sector. the fact, however, “light regulatory touch” usually le effective credit union member need most. i assure that, base data available central bank, several credit union improve operation accordance sound prudential principle espouse legislation. perhaps compel reason central bank regulator credit union trinidad tobago credit union deposit-taking entities. this place fiduciary responsibility director officer credit union safeguard members’ deposits, require credit union subject prudential oversight regime. in trinidad tobago, central bank responsible prudential regulation supervision. lady gentlemen, i readily admit skill expertise central bank’s current pool supervisor bias towards regulate bank insurance companies. in regard, bank already create specialize unit within financial institution supervision department work development credit union legislation supervise financial activity credit unions. in addition, bank strengthen supervisory capacity recruit person in-depth knowledge understand business, governance risk management practice credit unions. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a prime regulatory agency, central bank sacred responsibility ensure member sleep peacefully nights, secure knowledge life save credit union well protect sound management, effective governance strong prudential oversight. apart fiduciary argument, i would like draw attention world council credit union (woccu), also make case agency like central bank regulate credit unions. in july 2008 technical guide regulation supervision credit unions, woccu maintain ministry agency regulate financial institution also supervise credit unions. woccu consistently find credit union supervise financial sector regulator enjoy great public confidence trust well strong financial performance. take broad perspective, i must point economy scale one prudential regulator within jurisdiction. such mega-regulator help minimize risk regulatory arbitrage negate need coordination regulation supervisory action among multiple regulators. many may recall mega-regulator concept consistent 2004 white paper reform financial system trinidad tobago envisage “a single regulatory authority necessary power authority integrate regulation sector” trinidad tobago. principle underlie propose credit union legislation lady gentlemen, i turn propose credit union legislation. at outset, i must draw attention fact central bank engage extensively stakeholder craft new, robust regulatory regime credit unions. these stakeholder include ministry finance, ministry labour small micro enterprise development, co-operative credit union league, association credit union presidents, member credit union movement. over past six years, central bank issue three policy proposal document (ppds) view develop best possible legislation credit union sector. the first ppd issue 2006. it serve basis initial discussion consultation key stakeholders. the second third ppds issue 2007 2009, respectively. these ppds incorporate wide range view credit union key actor credit union sector consultations. i must mention consultation well attend stakeholder participate actively, provide relevant comments. in 2009, central bank form committee make representative league, association presidents, ministry finance commissioner’s office finalize various policy provision draft bill well amendment cooperative society act. a draft credit union bill send consultation november 2011. in january 2012, bank hold information session draft bill sector. the bank currently review comment feedback representative league association presidents. lady gentlemen, i must indicate draft credit union bill recognize co-operative principles, democratic structure, service member social goal credit unions. permit point example recognition propose legislation. • first, draft credit union bill recognize member ultimate decision-making body credit union. appointment external auditor, election fit proper director approval audit financial statement make member agm. a such, credit union member determine fitness 4 bi central bankers’ speech propriety elect officer director require approval central bank, unlike obtain bank insurance companies. the central bank supervise work board ensure determination fitness propriety effective. • second, draft credit union bill recognise credit union operate principle volunteerism board comprise person membership. a result, requirement quorum independent director board, require banks. notwithstanding this, central bank encourage board supplement expertise risk management, financial analysis compliance, external advisors, may required. • third, draft credit union bill affirm democratic principle “one vote per member”, irrespective number share held. this, therefore, remove necessity provision regulate “controlling shareholder”, obtain bank insurance companies. • finally, draft credit union bill uphold principle “service members”. a such, credit union engage non-financial activities, limit. beyond limit, credit union pool resource cooperative continue provide service members, large scale. difference cooperative society act draft credit union bill lady gentlemen, fundamental difference approach regulation supervision commissioner cooperative development central bank. these fundamental difference bear legislation. permit point relevant ones. first, commissioner involve operation credit union. the commissioner approve by-laws, individual investment transactions, provision non-financial service use reserve funds. the central bank, hand, place permit activities, prohibition limit draft credit union bill regulations. this remove need inspector financial institution engage time-consuming task approve individual transaction activity credit unions. second, cooperative society act deficient prudential criteria, governance, enforcement/sanctions protection members’ funds. the prudential criterion cover capital borrow require credit union must establish 10 percent surplus reserve fund borrow limit set annually agm. by contrast, heart draft credit union bill regime prudential criterion cover capital, liquidity, asset quality earnings, borrowing, credit exposure non-financial activities. the prudential framework align pearl financial ratio adopt main local credit union sector. third, key responsibility board outline co-operative society act cover preparation annual balance sheet, convene vote agm election board members. by contrast, draft credit union bill capture standard effective governance board. it outline fit proper criterion directors, term limits, consideration multiple directorships, annual attestation compliance fit proper requirements. it also call board approval policies, assurance arms-length basis transaction establishment additional risk investment committee support work board. finally, offence exist co-operative society act. these include corrupt practice bribery, falsely obtaining, withhold misapply property, deal property subject charge. under draft credit union bill, central bank wide enforcement authority. the inspector financial institution may recommend, direct, bi central bankers’ speech 5 suspend apply judicial management credit union operate unsafe unsound manner, may illiquid insolvent violation act. linger industry concern lady gentlemen, despite compel case regulation credit union central bank extensive, broad-based stakeholder consultation propose new regulatory regime, industry concern still linger. most recently, president credit union league express concern term “serious deficiencies” propose legislation could stint growth credit union movement (guardian newspaper, february 2013). he list follow four concerns: • restrict term limit directors; • potential conflict two regulators; • non-recognition evolution credit union service beyond “collecting people’s money loans”; • regime criminalize violation credit union bill hamper volunteerism movement i would like address concern order dispel, far practicable, linger fears. first, respect restrict term limit directors, i please announce minister finance agree extend transition period eighteen month three year act come effect, cause undue disruption governance structure credit union sector. in limit impact study, central bank find board many large credit union director would excess initially propose term limits, compliance could pose severe disruption function boards. second, respect potential conflict two regulator important make distinction regulatory role commissioner cooperative central bank. the commissioner continue look registration, membership, education train development credit unions. the central bank prudential regulator specific emphasis safety soundness credit unions. there little, any, potential conflict interest. a i indicate earlier, commissioner central bank work closely draft credit union bill amendment cooperative society act make sure overlap duplication two piece legislation. we intend continue work closely together regulation credit union sector, focus regulatory remit area competence. third, past years, credit union have, approval commissioner cooperatives, venture non-financial services. these include travel agency services, resorts, gym facilities, daycare services, retail outlet real estate development. we recognize non-core activity provide supplementary source earn credit union provide additional service credit union membership. however, non-core activity represent potential drain limit managerial capacity expertise many credit unions. moreover, non-financial activity pose risk outside supervisory responsibility central bank. a consequence, draft credit union bill allow credit union provide non-financial service subject certain limit revenue assets. these limit seek ensure financial intermediation remain core business credit union credit 6 bi central bankers’ speech union minimize balance sheet risk arise non-financial activities. in fact, woccu recommend “the sum non-financial investment exceed 5 percent total assets”. in event non-financial service grow beyond propose limits, member credit union must direct board establish new cooperative, singly conjunction credit unions, continue provision services. i wish emphasize prohibition propose legislation credit union new cooperative governance structure composition, allowance request sector. finally, draft credit union bill make violation act failure comply direction issue bank, criminal offence, credit union officer director. lady gentlemen, i wish advise that, practice, inspector financial institution first call credit union officer fix problem, letter advice, recommendation compliance direction. in give direction, inspector follow due process law give credit union time make representation cause violation submit plan correction. i also wish advise central bank exercise option bring matter court credit union opt payment administrative fine. a such, even though provision criminal charge law, use last resort else failed. conclusion lady gentlemen, propose credit union legislation important step towards place credit union movement position great strength, safety soundness. a transition robust regulatory regime, central bank use time passage new legislation analyze audit financial statement credit union respond request copy statements. over last year, receive statement 35 credit unions. we renew request shortly credit union send u recent audit financial statements. the central bank also encourage credit union ass impact propose legislation operation share result concern bank. we response large credit union term director small credit union member league share data calculate ratio prudential criteria. we encourage credit union participate exercise valuable mean orientation new regime. go forward, key institutional support new regulatory framework establishment mandatory deposit insurance system credit union sector. not would insurance system cover deposit must include share represent vast majority sector’s savings, situation unique trinidad tobago. in jurisdictions, protection fund credit union sector cover deposit only. we central bank expect credit union movement continue play critical financial inclusion role financial sector. we feel strongly, however, robust regulation supervision urgently need support growth development credit unions. in closing, lady gentlemen, i thank board telephone workers’ credit union invite agm, i wish member well future contribution community, economy national development. i thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 patrick honohan: the european union – financial, fiscal, economic

presidency union first time 2011; role rotate ireland perform seventh time 40 year membership. a know, semesters, national government, support national administrative structures, seek progress council’s role strategic legislative programme union. poland’s effective presidency, steer turbulent discussion economic governance one pressure episode economic crisis, secure agreement reinforce fiscal coordination so-called “six-pack” legislative measures, recall strikingly successful one. eighteen month later, though systemic financial crisis euro area le acute, even employment growth resume countries, unemployment record level conspicuous evidence depth persistence recessionary time europe. it would astonish institutional deepen reform economic infrastructure european union still centre stage legislative agenda 2013 i assure large intensive effort mount administrative resource irish economic financial authority try progress agenda. before mention detail element current legislative debate, let stand back bit, though ask eurosystem need relaunch. how come great expectation euro single currency european union seem fully realized? why commentator identify euro source weakness rather strength euro area economies, well which, like poland, intertwine euro area (i see, example, well half poland’s export go euro area)? and reform currently 2 bi central bankers’ speech discuss correct type sufficient scale set thing back kind path expect advance, current crisis actually achieve practice, low inflation anchor inflationary expectations, also modest fall debt ratios, convergence financial market conditions, reasonably steady growth – notably – considerable reduction unemployment? in case doubt relaunch needed, may useful note key entry-requirement indicator government debt, government deficit bond yield show considerably great divergence entry (even though entry criterion apply relatively liberal manner. but need kind fiscal restraint clearly prerequisite restore something close envisage indicator threshold level entry – task six-pack two-pack legislative measure – deep reform policy behaviour ensure divergence easily recur, construction institution help rebuild trust confidence market participant partner country within outside euro area. for this, need understand go wrong. it easy point global financial crisis culprit, certainly crisis, origin unite states, devastate impact. but problem particularly deep intractable euro area? after all, euro area country equally affected. germany, take large strike example, emerge shock last year low unemployment before. and, adversely affect countries, imbalance excess experience quite diverse. greece’s problem emerge result large under-appreciated fiscal deficits, italy’s result high debt persistent lack growth dynamism, ireland banking-driven boom-and-bust cycle. what common feature syndromes? this important u understand need deepen relaunch system, also, course, vital country contemplate prepare future euro membership. i believe key mystery lie fact euro represent commitment device, policy straitjacket which, accompany behaviour country implicitly explicitly commit join currency union, lead improve economic performance relative otherwise achieved. the commitment course policy retain macroeconomic balance, require fiscal discipline, international competitiveness price non-price dimensions. for decades, many european union country chequer history macroeconomic imbalances, generally resolve devaluation cost relatively high inflation, high nominal real interest rates, contribute growth-damaging uncertainty. in addition considerable microeconomic benefit eliminate currency conversion cost exchange rate risk intra-euro area transactions, main advantage currency union see low inflation interest rates, contribute stable growth platform. yet policymakers market participant believe result would happen semi-automatically. government would adopt restrain fiscal policy fear market reaction, didn’t market would quickly penalize interest penalty would incentivize get back track. bi central bankers’ speech 3 likewise loss competitiveness due wage rate increase fast currency area would result quick damage employment divergence would short-lived. above all, private capital flow could rely upon stabilize sustainable. with strong force macroeconomic stability, need anyone pay attention fiscal cost competitiveness? but market effective task-masters, allow old pattern imbalance persist. indeed, fluidity large-scale international capital flow (partly attributable currency union itself, even – see parallel experience country iceland latvia – technology-driven liberalization finance) allow imbalance become large ever. the difference old adjustment device – devaluation inflation – eschewed. imbalances, allow emerge, even costly consequence safety valve – imperfect corrosive though – available. high debt ratio sweat or, impossible greece, effect write down. the need fiscal contraction remove demand trigger double-dip recession several affect countries, unemployment soared, especially extent inflexibility nominal wage rate inhibit need restoration cost-competitiveness. the solvency banks, country suffer adjustment, extend large advance across border within currency union, come suspicion. on top this, severity need adjustment make market question ability member state stick single currency – doubt whose elimination require invention ecb’s outright monetary transaction (omt) programme. in sum, continue failure maintain fiscal, cost financial discipline countries, despite implicit commitment embody euro area membership, much severe consequence previous decade autonomous often weak currencies. how poland ensure life euro (whenever come about) could accomplish without mishap imbalance characterize several euro area country financial crisis? i believe ireland’s experience suggest done, error make could avoid without much difficulty, long commitment require membership widely appreciated. thus one would envisage decisive response – macro prudential fiscal tool – big property price construction boom make ireland record-breaker mid-decade; degree fiscal balance become dependent boom-time revenue could good recognized, public expenditure keep check accordingly; finally, thing get point wide scale bank failure, crisis management could allow low socialization losses. in avoid pitfall future, new euro-area institutional arrangement help, fact well-managed economy nothing fear euro. the consequence misbehaviour policy fail respect commitment, economic performance stress countries, also spilled-over wide concern function economic monetary union. cross-border interbank lend dried-up, introduce sizable divergence cost credit different member state which, though wide one point, 4 bi central bankers’ speech remain substantial represent departure come expect single currency area. credit long seem flow seamlessly across border without incur de facto country premium stress countries. it often remark nothing wholly justify risk-premium present start. that could true interest charge market lend governments. but i sure hold non-government borrowers: seem largely spillover fiscal macro-prudential risk cannot easily avoid firm stress country even firm-specific condition would warrant high risk premium. this not, course, country-specific national source competitive advantage disadvantage. tax rates, social benefits, infrastructure, name few. so emergence interest differential lend unique. but departure envisage outset single currency hold important integrate function euro. and sudden awaken market credit risk lend government much damage now, government accumulate much debt, constant outset. stress country naturally turned, imf, also partner european union assistance circumstances. the country avoid error call upon provide financial assistance rather large scale five stress countries. the assistance grant form loans, even taxpayer electorate may fear save threaten lend market reluctant go. the fear seem system effect spread cost policy error country taxpayer country maintain discipline. this fear influence design crisis management measures. thus, often case come finance stress borrowers; neither borrower lender content. herein lie fundamental rationale relaunch euro: need ensure collaborative arrangement command confidence stress strong. that confidence underpin quick comprehensive crisis management base strong sense trust, solidarity common purpose among member state yet fully evidence. the fiscal aspect crisis first receive attention point view reform strengthen institutional structures. a successive financial assistance package greece, ireland, portugal cyprus put place conjunction imf deal loss market access country crisis, institutional deepen also works. the initial fund vehicle, efsf, succeed permanent successor, esm, incorporate risk-sharing mechanism base mutual national guarantee proportional share ecb capital. but one dimension fiscal institutional reforms. i already mention pass progress towards strengthen surveillance

ingredient build confidence strong country bank weakness expose stress country go recur persist supervisory inadequacies. to sure, single resolution authority common deposit guarantee system also need bank union complete. the former build current draft legislation national resolution systems, actively negotiate presidency, latter’s importance underlined, i believe, recent developments. let describe little detail progress discussion presidency. a over-riding theme presidency, ireland seek see “a recovery country drive recovery europe”. thus, try build national experience considerable domestic effort recovery help consolidate fiscal economic stability across european scene. ireland long enter endeavour inspire certain core values: • ireland always uphold community method rather

deutsche bank woman european business conference “competition versus coalition – quest growth?”, frankfurt main, 20 march 2013. * * * dear ms. siebert, dear mr. leithner, lady gentlemen, thank much invite speak woman european business conference organise deutsche bank. the topic year’s conference – quest growth – could scarcely relevant europe today. a audience know good most, low growth environment pose serious challenge businesses. uncertainty future drag confidence barrier new investment. it cause bank cut back lending, especially small- medium-sized firms, critical help growth rebound. and all, low growth deeply affect life ordinary people europe. a result, many frustrated, even desperate. they doubt whether european strategy deal crisis right one. they asking: “will ever come it, ever cut austerity?” and right legitimate ask this. “power masses” key theme conference. we democratic society europe important choice future country monetary union require proper public debate. but debate also need base substance. rage alone solve problems. just angry politician officials, even justified, help citizen understand crisis. people need present real choice face – even mean take hard decision make sacrifices. offer allegedly easy solutions, present false alternatives, abandon debate populist gamble long-term prosperity societies. so today i would like present view choice face europe – so, expose myth misconception european approach manage crisis. concretely, i want answer two questions: • first, alternative current strategy, so, real consequences? • second, condemn “lost decade”, find new source growth lift u crisis? 1. the reality alternative policy-makers sometimes speak certain course action without alternative – “alternativlos” say german. of course, true. there always alternatives. the question whether superior, especially assess likely impact longer-term consequences. 2 bi central bankers’ speech so let begin look alternatives. a know, one pillar crisis response europe consolidate government budgets. progress far good: european commission estimate that, end year, euro area whole budget deficit 3% gdp. but progress also cost short term: growth turn low forecast unemployment rise steeply. almost 19 million people euro area currently without job – include almost one every four young people. in face hardship, strategy reduce deficit come increase criticism commentator politicians. some urge “exit austerity cage”. others claim that, continue cut deficit growth low, policy-makers ignore evidence, even ideological. to exit crisis, say, europe must engage urgent change course: time, le austerity; public money, le reform. let clear: i also concern high level unemployment. i would also like see strong growth. but propose change course, need think consequences. this responsible policymaking means. and put simply, consequence stop cut deficit increase public debts. be feasible sustainable solution problems? the real consequence change course in view, answer “no”. first, regardless merits, strategy would work private investor will finance high borrow reasonable rates. and certainly big “if”, especially country whose debt already high rising. second, illusion think debt answer debt crisis. recent research show high public debt level euro area hamper growth, serious negative effect start debt exceed 90% gdp. average euro area public debt already level – almost 95% gdp – add debt put u danger zone. third, strategy increase debt simply push problem future. any benefit current generation come expense future generations. high borrow today mean high interest payment tomorrow – pay tax tomorrow’s citizens. moreover, today’s generation consumes, future generation save get debt level back again. and this: part new eu debt rule, euro area country legally bind start reduce public debt 60% gdp. to give sense means, take example italy. public debt almost 130% gdp, halve next generation abide debt limit. around 80 billion euro year go debt service – 10% annual budget, spend education infrastructure. on top this, future generation face number hide cost yet factor debt figures. these include effect age society unknown consequence change climate. bi central bankers’ speech 3 to take example germany, european commission project 2012 age report work age population fall 30% 2060. at time, age-related spend continue increase. this mean that, year year, ever small number worker support ever large social security system. our obligation future generation in words, future generation already carry major burden. be fair them, increase debt today, make heavy still? the economist john maynard keynes famously dismiss long-term consideration argument “in long-run we’re dead”. this true – are, child grandchild not. by ensure fiscal soundness today, represent voice current debate. to sum up, i question benefit change course, i satisfy current situation, alternative available worse. they mean place short-term expediency long-term sustainability – which, me, opposite responsible policy-making. citizen take decision great importance future – directly ask ballot box. by cast votes, make choice determine lives, also generation come. they deserve full picture alternative face do. 2. the potential european strategy but citizen still rightly ask: growth come from? this lead second theme address today. be euro area condemn “lost decade” low growth high unemployment? or new source growth exploit get crisis? here, answer depend government themselves. the truth option come growth. there new source growth tapped, even budget cut. but so, implement pillar european strategy. they enact deep-rooted economic reform increase potential economy grow. reform open markets, increase competition, remove bureaucracy. reform advance innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, help public administration actually serve public. these reform easy implement. they require tough choices, perseverance confront vest interests, patience effect become visible. reform path growth… but potential huge. to give sense achieved, recent research imf1 find euro area country could boost gdp 3% five year open market competition reform tax systems. and could also lot support growth remove remain barrier single market europe – particular complete single market services. 1 barkbu, b., rahman, j., valdés, r., “fostering growth europe now”, imf staff discussion note, june 2012 4 bi central bankers’ speech the european commission estimate implement service directive – cover activity make around 40% eu gdp – could reap additional gain 330 billion euro, 2.5% eu gdp, five ten years. and require implement legislation already agreed. …and fairness high growth benefit reforms: also contribute social fairness. a oecd go growth 2012 report put it, “double dividend” structural reforms. commentator criticise social consequence european strategy often forget element focus effect budget cut – sometimes fall hard vulnerable group society. but well-designed reform opposite effect: fact create opportunity people margin society. let allude this: in spain, rigid two-tier labour market protect insiders. this mean young people, flexible contracts, bear burden economic downturn. a result, almost 6 10 currently unemployed. in another country, administration tax collection weak lead enormous amount tax arrears. a result, ordinary people tax salary pay make difference. these case lack reform lead unfair outcome – structural reform could help towards fair society. ultimately, structural reforms, winner outnumber potential losers. it time message get attention. the never-ending race however, fall trap think struggle country need take hard decisions. we compete today, within europe rest world. there sit back, country. germany decade ago call “the sick man europe”; people wonder publicly “germany saved”. since then, country become showcase well-designed reform turn situation around. but example also serf warn – others quickly catch up. if struggle country continue pursue ambitious reforms, germany rest laurels, could country leave slow lane. so also need tap new source growth, like professional services, remain unreformed. 3. conclusion let conclude. the challenge avoid false alternatives, take hard decisions, new one. niccolo machiavelli observe 16th century that, “there nothing difficult carry institute new order things. because reformer enemy profit old condition lukewarm defender may well new.”2 2 niccolò machiavelli, the prince, 1532 bi central bankers’ speech 5 we ecb different: also structural problem address. and since i speak “women european business” conference, let focus one particular: underrepresentation female staff management position govern bodies. for long time, i personally favour kind affirmative action, i convince qualify woman would eventually make way top. but i come realise case – neither work environment i familiar with, wide scale. i strike i hear take 70 year achieve gender-balance uk’s large 100 company current rate change maintained.3 the ecb’s executive board recently discuss enhance gender diversity management decide that, on, talk diversity – act. all study show commitment top key bring change. the commitment – want new measure board ask human resource department provide us. other international financial institution like imf eib well european commission advance introduce gender targets, define specific quantitative – albeit non-binding – goal employ woman various levels. we think learn experience institution target may serve benchmark us. this mark significant change, especially generally rather conservative world central banking. all change imply challenge, especially top organisation. but leadership must challenge keep relevant – another theme conference. the key issue how, challenged, answers. the current concern europe head challenge leadership. they properly answered. not resort populism false alternative – reaffirming, clearly honestly, path take right one. thank attention. 3 equality human right commission, 2008 bi central bankers’ speech 1 spencer dale: inflation growth – role monetary policy? speech mr spencer dale, executive director, monetary policy, chief economist bank england, asian business association chinese business association london chamber commerce industry, bank england, london, 15 march 2013. * * * i would like thank stephen burgess, matt trott garry young considerable help prepare speech. the view express necessarily reflect member monetary policy committee. monetary policy spotlight. the previously sedate world inhabit middle aged, grey suit – often, male – central banker turn upside financial crisis. a global debate rag role monetary policymakers – – play try stimulate growth economies. here uk, breadth urgency debate unlike anything see since birth inflation target 21 year ago. nobody surprise this. our recovery financial crisis prove long arduous. at time, inflation remain stubbornly target. the monetary policy committee (mpc) face tough choice try support recovery bring inflation down. and away home, central bank undergo considerable change: federal open market committee (fomc) unite state bank japan recently make policy change emphasise commitment provide monetary stimulus economy recover. against backdrop, people understandably ask role monetary policy uk play determine growth inflation? this important debate one likely central economic policymaking next years. what i would like today offer think issue. i want focus two aspect particular. the first concern objective monetary policy. the inflation target, give mpc uk government, state primary objective ensure cpi inflation equal 2%. but also make clear that, doing, mindful implication policy action growth employment. how go reconcile different objectives? the second issue relate current operation monetary policy. what make view, repeat many quarters, trade growth inflation may unusually favourable present circumstances. that could buy quite bite extra growth little cost term high inflation? do free lunch really exist? the two objective monetary policy let’s start objective monetary policy mission mpc hit 2% inflation target way support growth employment. those twin objective highlight starkly last month committee’s reaction update forecast inflation contain february inflation report. inflation project rise near-term – 3% second half year – remain 2% target next two year so. but rather tighten policy, issue statement explain that, present circumstances, think appropriate bring inflation back target slowly usual. our reaction partly drive judgement protract period above-target inflation would, part, reflect high university tuition fee domestic energy 2 bi central bankers’ speech bills. importantly, price rise largely consequence regulatory decisions, rather market forces. in contrast, cost price pressure result balance demand supply domestic economy look well contained. although inflationary impact high administer regulate price likely persist several year – impact recent weaken sterling also push inflation – likely wane time. a such, inflation expect fall back around 2% target end 2015. but committee also explicit willingness tolerate period above-target inflation drive weakness economy concern attempt bring inflation back target quickly would risk derail recovery. indeed, desire support growth well control inflation characteristic mpc’s behaviour since onset financial crisis. cpi inflation 2% target much past 5 years, period cut bank rate 5% 0.5%, conduct asset purchase programme – qe – scale equivalent almost 25% nominal gdp, launch fund lend scheme boost credit growth real economy. i accept much period committee expect inflation fall back target quickly actually did. even so, remain case monetary policy loosen aggressively time inflation persistently target near certain knowledge would lead deep potentially much painful recession. the suggestion make quarter mpc slavishly follow inflation target recent year – fixate inflation expense growth employment – simply odds facts. base mpc’s central projection inflation publish last month, decade end 2015, cpi inflation average close 3%. it 2% target 90% time, 3% 40% time. yes: might result poor forecasting. but much important recognition low profile inflation possible tighten monetary policy cost even deep recession even large rise unemployment. monetary policy frontline support economy financial crisis continue so. indeed, strike criticise mpc focus narrowly inflation, others argue we’ve worry much real economy take eye inflationary ball. “is mpc’s job hit inflation target not”, ask? ha inflation target become sham? the remit give monetary policy committee make clear job hit 2% inflation target. but also acknowledge inflation occasion deviate target result shock disturbances, “...attempts keep inflation inflation target circumstance may cause undesirable volatility output”.1 although language arcane, mean clear: monetary policy try prevent damage boom bust output employment. this secondary objective matter central recent conduct monetary policy. to repeat: could deliver low inflation recent years, 1 the relevant clause remit state “the framework base recognition actual inflation rate occasion depart target result shock disturbances. attempt keep inflation inflation target circumstance may cause undesirable volatility output.” see http://www.hmtreasury.gov.uk/d/open_letter_from_chx_to_boe_22032011.pdf bi central bankers’ speech 3 expense provide le support growth employment midst significant economic downturn generation. that monetary policy concern growth well inflation nothing new. indeed, way back 1997 – year mpc first establish – mervyn king, lowly chief economist bank england, refer value “constrained discretion” build inflation target regime.2 the “discretion” relate speed inflation return target. in response certain kind development – jargon, so-called “supply shocks” move output inflation opposite direction – inflation return target relatively slowly order minimise harmful fluctuation output. but subject “constraint” inflation ultimately return target do way maintain target’s credibility. inflation target sham: discipline inflation target paramount. but operate manner also support output employment long – long – credibility maintained. without credibility discretion. this concern consequence growth employment within inflation target regime sometimes refer “output smoothing”. monetary policy ability affect level output long-run, help smooth cyclical variations. more recently, underpin reference “flexible inflation targeting”: mpc flexibility vary speed inflation return target depend circumstances. most colourfully observation, make mervyn king, inflation target compel policymakers behave like “inflation nutters”: scope care stabilise output employment well control inflation.3 that monetary policymakers concern implication action real economy – growth output strength employment – must surely seem right us. the late eddie george – who, together mervyn king, perhaps anyone cement importance bank england low stable inflation – stress repeatedly low inflation “is end .... [it is] necessary mean end sustainable growth output high live standards”.4 it’s important don’t lose sight override aim. eddie equally clear that, long run, best contribution monetary policy could make achieve prosperous vibrant economy deliver endure price stability. he see first hand pernicious cost high variable inflation 70 80s: company household unable budget plan efficiently; resource misallocated; long-term contract avoid fear large swing inflation would end bite one party other. the value hard-earned save eroded. out pain misery emerge consensus – hard consensus – low stable inflation prerequisite economic prosperity. more recently, though, worry sign crack may appear consensus. a sense inflation somehow yesterday’s war. that central bank focus growth. that period high inflation may even aid recovery. this dangerous talk. it sometimes feel like we’ve before. one mistake make policymakers late 1960s allow inflation get control nearly two decade price 2 king (1997), “inflation target 5 year on”, speech give london school economics. 3 king (1997), “changes uk monetary policy: rule discretion practice”, journal monetary economics. 4 george (1999), annual cornwall lecture. 4 bi central bankers’ speech stability. a sir alec cairncross, work host senior economic role heart civil service period, put “...governments last year 1960s …allowed inflation expectation develop prove increasingly difficult extinguish” (cairncross 1992). there little doubt policymakers time strong aversion inflation, complacent risk pose stimulus. it would irresponsible repeat mistake again. how ensure lesson yesteryear forgotten? that period relative price stability breed complacency? that collective national memory maintained? a key part answer find role regime institutions.5 individual policymakers official come go. intellectual idea pop fashion. the inflation target mpc result long painful search credible money anchor. they provide memory ensure don’t return inefficiency inequity 70 80s. they provide memory underpin consensus low stable inflation perquisite economic prosperity. and provide memory guard dangerous talk late. let sum section twin objective monetary policy. the mpc objective growth well inflation. the current inflation target regime provide considerable flexibility mpc support output employment. and recent years, mpc use flexibility full. indeed, argue excessively so. the mpc forefront support growth employment continue so. but flexibility constrain discipline monetary policy must set manner consistent inflation come back target. without credibility, monetary policy wouldn’t flexibility support real economy. and ultimately deliver low stable inflation best contribution monetary policy make achieve robust sustainable recovery. the trade growth inflation let turn second issue i want discus today concern operation monetary policy and, particular, likely trade-off growth inflation current environment. a i said, february mpc make clear think appropriate bring inflation back target slowly usual order support nascent recovery. but case monetary policy go even further? what if, commentator claimed, possible mpc inject additional monetary stimulus, thereby provide even great support growth, relatively little consequence inflation. strong growth little high inflation: surely would good use mpc’s flexibility? there two strand argument put forward current trade-off growth inflation may unusually favourable. the first cost price pressure current environment may relatively insensitive degree slack economy. if case, economy could grow relatively rapidly, absorb spare resource capacity, without put much upward pressure wage prices. in economists’ speak, so-called phillips curve – sketch relationship spare capacity cost price pressure – may relatively flat moment. 5 king (2012) tucker (2012) make similar argument context financial stability role newly form financial policy committee play respect. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the second possibility effective capacity economy supply good service depend state demand: strong demand, great somehow capacity company employee meet it. the likely responsiveness supply increase demand, it’s argued, mean would possible economy grow relatively rapidly without significantly reduce degree slack economy without add markedly cost price pressures. let’s consider briefly possibility turn. the suggestion phillips curve may relatively flat appears, least first blush, consistent experience recent years. follow bad recession live memory, economy barely grow past two years. output well pre-crisis level, unemployment close 8%. but inflation remain stubbornly target. the trade-off output inflation indeed remarkably flat. but doesn’t mean flatness trade-off rely upon continue future: depend inflation sticky. much slack economy concentrate labour market, unemployment remain painfully elevated. and, would expected, high unemployment associate mark moderation wage growth. indeed, show chart 1, relationship wage unemployment past three year look pretty similar experience mid-90s unemployment rate similar today. there strong evidence suggest wage phillips curve uk flat twenty year ago.6 if labour market, possible spare capacity within company may le impact usual price decisions? maybe, especially cash-struck company le will able cut price order utilise spare capacity gain market share. but best tell survey measure intelligence gather network agents, current margin spare capacity within company particularly pronounced. so even companies’ price strategy become le sensitive space capacity, unlikely explain much recent stickiness inflation. all told, i’m particularly persuade relationship economic slack cost price pressure become unusually weak. wage growth moderate broadly expect give rise unemployment. and appear significant margin spare capacity within companies. what unusual moderation wage growth reflect correspond fall domestic cost pressures. from account perspective, reflect unprecedented weakness productivity recent years. the level private sector productivity around 15% level imply continuation pre-crisis trend. this weakness productivity mean that, despite mute pay growth, unit labour cost – single big determinant companies’ cost – grow historical rate much four year since financial crisis. and indeed, it’s weakness productivity underpin second argument put forward relationship growth inflation may currently unusually favourable. the suggestion recent stagnation productivity – supply side economy generally – large part direct consequence demand weakness. if demand pickup, – – would prompt increase effective supply capacity companies. the economy could recover without significantly reduce degree spare capacity little additional inflation. 6 my mpc colleague ben broadbent make similar point speech last year (broadbent 2012). 6 bi central bankers’ speech the possibility persistent demand weakness may erode supply capacity new. indeed, central economic doldrums characterise economy first part 1990s. but different many channel important detract supply capacity don’t seem operate particularly strongly today. in particular, scourge long-term unemployment discourage job seeker leave labour market typify malaise early 90 far le evidence downturn. the rate long-term unemployed able move back employment remain around historical average (chart 2). and labour market participation hold pretty well (chart 3). likewise, surge corporate insolvency associate increase capital scrap see early 90 repeat (chart 4). if demand deficiency weigh supply side economy, it’s via different channel past. but deny may happening. there number mechanism persistent demand weakness may eat away effective supply capacity economy. indeed, many may experience firsthand. the need retain core skill maintain minimum staff level mean demand fall company – especially small company – able reduce workforce correspond amount. others choose hold experience workers, even currently underutilised, fear lose valuable experience knowhow. company comment u time resource need win new business secure contract increase sharply face weak demand.7 i’m sure mechanism many like work today. but sufficiently strong u confident likely relationship growth inflation would unusually favourable demand increase strongly? why mechanism much pronounce previous recessions? wouldn’t seem equally important past? i find hard believe type effect entire – even main – explanation weakness productivity. what unusual downturn associate severe prolong financial crisis. several bank still position lend normally. many firm economise work capital cost increase availability reduced. the ability many smes raise finance fund new investment business expansion constrained. the efficiency bank able (or willing) reallocate fund outdated business sector towards new dynamic company stunted. it seem implausible assume impairment bank system – life blood market economy – affect productivity general efficiency company operate.8 if case, may le confident supply capacity economy pickup markedly purely response increase demand, unless credit friction repaired. where leave us? the argument it’s possible grow economy without much increase inflation is, course, seductive enticing. it’s like offer free lunch. and yes, grind think trade-off growth inflation may well unusually favourable. but strong mechanism actually far clear. and seem 7 for detail discussion points, see mccafferty (2013). 8 there number empirical study suggest financial crisis material effect productivity output. see, example, furceri, d mouragane, a (2009), oulton, n sebastía-barriel, m (2013), imf world economic outlook (2009). bi central bankers’ speech 7 particularly optimistic assume financial crisis near cripple bank system play little role recent limp supply-side performance economy. take limit, argument monetary policy use expand demand little implication inflation challenge consensus best contribution monetary policy make long-term health prosperity economy deliver price stability. that consensus base painful experience monetary policy can’t affect level output long run. that can’t generate permanently high output permanently high employment simply print money.9 we nervous quickly overturn consensus. conclusion summary let conclude. the financial crisis thrust rather reserve world central bank monetary policy spotlight. that understandable healthy. monetary policy fail prevent financial crisis. and many countries, include uk, fail stimulate growth long see. it’s right inflation target – dominant paradigm govern operation monetary policy much industrialise world – question challenged. and mind good story tell. the inflation target ensure primary objective monetary policy deliver price stability. but afford flexibility operate way support output employment. the mpc use flexibility full recent years: forefront provide support economy aftermath financial crisis continue so. but must remember mistake past. without credibility flexibility. and ultimately, best contribution monetary policy make sustainable growth long-run prosperity deliver endure price stability. that important remember face suggestion inflation somehow yesterday’s battle focus monetary policy turn even firmly towards growth. it also remember make difficult judgement likely trade-off growth inflation far push mpc’s flexibility. 9 this consensus reflection belief long-run phillips curve vertical. take literally, suggestion possible monetary policy stimulate increase output little increase inflation point near horizontal long-run phillips curve, least range output expansion. 8 bi central bankers’ speech

necessary component financial integration. inefficiency barrier clear settlement make market access difficult investor issuers. the european security market cannot say fully integrate post-trade arrangement harmonised, ensure safety, full competition absence barrier across national markets. this authority industry player make great effort achieve post-trade harmonisation. today, offer comprehensive overview currently happen europe post-trade level. on behalf commissioner barnier, mr pauli highlight how, crisis, speed financial reform accelerated. many participant underscore importance transparency achieve safe post-trading increase exist level competition industry. we hear interest discussion legal initiative currently undertake eu level remove barrier hind single market objectives. mifid revise increase investor protection improve function eu capital markets. emir enter force summer 2012, require standard derivative contract clear central counterparties establish stringent organisational, business conduct prudential requirement central counterparties. the european commission’s 2 bi central bankers’ speech proposal csd regulation improve security settlement scrutiny eu legislators; enhance legal operational condition cross-border settlement union general, strong emphasis place today importance timely adoption. i note majority audience saw need adopt csd regulation late start 2014, also view allow sufficient time technical standards. the representative parliament commission highlight importance feasibility objective. finally, another initiative pipeline harmonise security law legislation, establish eu-wide framework ownership security increase legal certainty cross-border environments. combined, review mifid, emir, csd regulation security law legislation consistently build harmonise legal framework whole security transaction chain – trade clear settlement. important progress also make operational business levels. the notable example mention many today t2s, project huge potential market integration. t2s enable participate csds focus value-added service basic settlement service provide via single t2s platform. t2s thereby make easy business move one csd another. the actor harmonise t2s great chance reap full benefit t2s widen business. conversely, european csds harmonise may see security issue via csd settle predominantly another csd participate t2s. an area opportunity mention several time speaker today collateral management. some regulatory initiative i mention before, aim enhance safety financial markets, generate great demand high-quality collateral. at time, crisis make collateral scarcer: shift unsecured secure fund great recourse central bank liquidity. the increase demand collateral prompt market participant well eurosystem develop innovative way make good use exist collateral, i.e. make asset easily available, needed. harmonisation area crucial facilitate efficient mobilisation collateral across europe. example auto-collateralisation functionality offer t2s platform several initiative underway establish tri-party settlement interoperability. it clearly emerge discussion today post-trade harmonisation gain momentum achieve concrete results. the example hear detail progress make t2s harmonisation agenda. the t2s community post-trade industry engage implementation harmonise standard market practice area cut-off times, iso messages, corporate action processing, account number settlement finality. a jean-michel godeffroy illustrate early today, ambitious plan place come month sound record achievement far. i note audience express moderate optimism “priority one harmonisation topics” would achieve launch t2s. however, still lot work do order complete projects. it interest regard hear experience professor giovannini, whose name closely associate harmonisation market integration. in particular, analyse problem face giovannini group early 2000s. these reflection important u learn past experience able achieve concrete result go forward. the large participation conference today, distinguish speaker almost 250 participant europe, testimony joint willingness european national institution market player achieve post-trade harmonisation, thus contribute financial integration europe. let stress cause process contribute – single market – one make europe strong bi central bankers’ speech 3 attractive national well cross-border investment, thus activate sustain growth. to conclude, i wish thank much participation. particular thank go speaker panellist make discussion lively thought-provoking. finally, i would like take opportunity thank those, european commission ecb, involve prepare interest conference. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stefan ingves: manage structural risk swedish bank sector speech mr stefan ingves, governor sverige riksbank chairman basel committee bank supervision, affärsvärlden’s “bank & finans outlook”, stockholm, 20 march 2013. * * * today i intend speak riksbank’s view structural risk swedish bank sector managed. a often recent years, i take crisis 2007–2009, risk reassessment banks, investors, researcher decision-makers world force make result crisis, start point. i begin say word international work regulation arise consequence crisis. then i go little detail structure special characteristic swedish banks. on basis this, i present view possible implication implementation follow-up basel iii regulation swedish banks. the risk associate bank operation need limit first, however, i would like give small example risk talk about. the u mortgage crisis become acute 2007 mark start global financial crisis. at time, capital adequacy ratio, amount capital relation risk-weighted assets, major swedish bank average around 7 per cent. this mean every sek 1 000 risk-weighted assets, bank fund operation sek 70 money sek 930 borrow money. this fact rather generous calculation include capital turn dubious quality. decision also make time allow bank use internal risk model great extent calculate capital adequacy requirements. the bank thus able substantially reduce risk weight assets, include mortgages, long term. the major banks’ internal risk model indicate risk associate mortgage lend extremely low. in several case mean risk weight typical mortgage could easily low 6 per cent, mean 6 per cent mortgage would need covered. with capital adequacy ratio 7 per cent risk weight mortgage 6 per cent, mean bank could fund sek 1 000 mortgage loan sek 996 borrow money sek 4 money. the risk bank take lend sek 2 million purchase house thus correspond sek 8 000 capital. there fact transitional regulation initially mean bank able calculate liberally, regulation would apply long term thus bank investors, often authorities, primarily focus on. give banks, sweden countries, need small amount capital, give often assume back government guarantees, highly profitable take substantial risks. the bank carry small part risks, turn banks’ customer taxpayer carry major part. in several country – spain, ireland denmark example, addition unite state – see substantial fall price banks' assets, mainly form mortgages, lead major economic problems. the point risk capital bank shareholder provide limit value share capital. but society’s risk great this. a mainstream assessment economic research national crisis financial system cost economy around 60 per cent gdp. in sweden, would equivalent sek 2 000 billion, 2 bi central bankers’ speech sek 200 000 per swede. this two half time joint stock market value four major swedish bank turn year 2012/2013. in sweden, succeed manage acute phase financial crisis 2008 2009 way make possible limit cost society. one contribute factor probably crisis 1990s fresh mind bank thus limit risk-taking might otherwise case, least regard operation sweden. a know, country lucky. the negative effect crisis still evidence large part world – least several country central southern europe – probably remain time come. in retrospect, easy note combination shortcoming regulation profit motif participant financial market contribute one bad financial crisis modern era. the detail regard build-up risk course crisis describe several time i repeat here. it enough time note bank limit amount capital bank high degree market fund prove vulnerable storm broke. these insight crisis lie behind regulatory work underway sweden abroad today. there broad agreement risk-taking bank sector must limit cost must take account bank investor great extent. important step take direction global agreement future standard regulation bank sector refer basel iii accord. the worlds’ bank safe implemented, benefit everyone. basel iii increase safety margin system the basel iii regulation represent introduction much-needed standard require bank hold good capital. the minimum requirement cet 1 capital, share capital retain earnings, raise 4.5 per cent risk-weighted assets. in addition minimum requirement capital-conservation buffer, countercyclical capital buff buff systemically-important banks, sharpen requirement level cet 1 capital. in total, basel iii accord represent capital-adequacy requirement 7 12 per cent cet 1 capital depend important bank global systemic perspective country's economy credit cycle. this much high level previously. the countercyclical capital buff particularly interesting. this build good times, credit growth high normal, aim create airbags protect bank sector trouble times. so far, instrument international agreement reach field macroprudential policy, policy comprise measure prevent financial crisis direct system whole. a leverage ratio requirement also introduce which, irrespective risk weights, bank's asset may exceed 33 time capital. a leverage ratio requirement represent extra safety measure also limit banks’ possibility use internal risk model actually keep risk weight down. basel iii also set quantitative standard banks’ liquidity, short-term (liquidity coverage ratio, lcr) long-term (net stable fund ratio, nsfr). the short-term measure mean every bank sufficient liquid asset survive least 30 day stress scenario. the long-term measure, principle, limit gap maturity bank’s asset maturity liabilities. the standard stipulate basel iii accord implement national legislation 2010s implement entirety 2019, several interim target along way. bi central bankers’ speech 3 establish good regulation banks’ capital liquidity represent major step forward. however, wide perspective note even future worlds’ bank capital amount per cent assets. this almost within margin error valuation total assets. the equity/assets ratio bank sector one fifth, even one tenth, company sectors. however, central element basel iii accord standard minimum regulation – country want impose strict requirement may so. we already see case – example unite states, unite kingdom switzerland. decision also make unite state unite kingdom structural measure protect central function financial sector, example dodd-frank act follow-up vickers report. in eu, liikanen report take issue ring-fencing, separate different operation bank other. the reason financial system different different part world. it therefore important design regulation tailor bank system comply them. we also need maintain respectable distance minimum regulations. consider know swedish bank system, good reason ensure swedish bank comply global standard broad margin. the swedish bank system special it thus important put swedish bank system perspective. the total domestic foreign asset four major bank group amount 400 per cent sweden's gdp. in words, bank system huge. relatively speaking, par bank system unite kingdom, example. the swedish bank system also highly integrated, mean problem one bank easily lead crisis confidence entire system. if hit financial crisis, cost society could thus high. with mind, i intend focus detail two vulnerability swedish financial system interlinked. the first indebtedness swedish households. the second banks’ fund foreign currency dependence currency-swap market. the swedish mortgage market structural weakness an issue widely discuss recently indebtedness swedish household risk fall house prices. experience several country show indebtedness development house price main explanation country hit hard others economic crises. similarly, crisis precede credit house boom tend long severe economic crises.1 a fall house price may lead household save rather consume order compensate fact value home fallen. if many household behave way, may weaken economic activity, increase unemployment create loan loss banks' lend companies. this, example, happen neighbour country denmark recent years. what note credit condition mortgage change early 2000s. interest-only mortgage become increasingly common time loan-to-value ratio increased. the bank also begin fund mortgage issue so-called cover 1 see claessens, s., a, kose, m, terrones (2011), “financial cycles: what? how? when?”, imf work paper. cepr discussion paper, no.8379. 4 bi central bankers’ speech bond financial market increase extent. easy access inexpensive fund combination high demand mortgage lead rapid credit growth. now, debt swedish household high historical international terms. although rate credit growth slow loan-to-value ratio fall – mortgage cap introduce 2010 probably contribute – still structural weakness swedish mortgage market. for instance, mortgage survey recently publish finansinspektionen identify one weakness: approximately half new mortgage interest-only loans.2 this increase scope household take large loans, turn increase debt stock. figure 1 show household debt relation disposable income. it also illustrate indebtedness household sector grow different assumption amortisation. this raise number question future. for example, average loan-to-value ratio banks' mortgage stock develop old mortgage pay new interest-only mortgage pay out? what long-term consequence weak non-existent amortisation culture peoples' private finances, national economy expectation economic policy? these question consider analyse together finansinspektionen. figure 1 household debt different assumption regard amortisation behaviour percentage disposable income note. the figure present simple illustrative calculation indebtedness may develop give different assumption households’ amortisation behaviour future. the figure interpret riksbank’s forecast. sources: statistic sweden riksbank. the banks’ extensive market fund foreign currency make system vulnerable another structural weakness swedish bank system degree market fund high. we see this, example, look lend relation deposits. lend significantly high swedish bank system many european 2 accord finansinspektionen’s mortgage survey 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 5 country (see figure 2). this partly swede large extent save fund rather bank accounts. another reason swedish bank retain mortgage loan balance sheets, bank many country “sell” securitise them. figure 2 lend relation deposit bank system european country per cent note. refer monetary financial institution sources: the ecb riksbank. swedish bank thus highly dependent capital market fund lending. a large proportion, almost 45 per cent, fund capital market foreign currencies. this borrow fund asset swedish kronor foreign currencies. this dependence market borrow foreign currency give rise two risks. the first relate extent participant prepare buy banks’ mortgage bond necessary convert borrow foreign currency swedish kronor. the second lie fact maturity asset liability foreign currency differ. few counterparties fund long-term lend swedish kronor the borrow foreign currency also fund lend swedish kronor extent, example house purposes. the swedish bank typically fund mortgage loan issue cover bond mortgage act collateral. a large proportion bond issue foreign currencies, mainly euro u dollars. the reason bank choose get fund foreign market probably want spread source fund across different markets. this also something credit-rating agency encourage. it also often prove inexpensive method fund mortgage loans. however, broaden investor base may also mean consist large percentage volatile investors. problem swedish house 0%50%100%150%200%250%300%350% 6 bi central bankers’ speech market may therefore lead bank find difficult refinance mortgage loans. we actually believe bank manage rather substantial fall market value housing, investors' assessment risk increase may choose buy swedish banks' bonds, despite fact entail minor credit risk. such concern may also make type market fund expensive inaccessible investor choose reduce exposure swedish bank sector. we saw example autumn 2008, foreign investor wish offload swedish mortgage security market demand liquid instruments, particularly swedish government securities, increased. the swedish national debt office carry extra issue treasury bill provide loan reverse repos cover mortgage bonds. at time, riksbank expand list approve form collateral. all all, mean principle government assume risk lay outstanding stock swedish mortgage loans. in order convert borrow foreign currency lend swedish kronor without take currency risk, bank usually conduct currency swaps. in simple terms, do like this: a swedish bank borrow euro germany maturity five years. however, bank really need euro need kronor fund mortgage loan swedish households, bank exchange euro kronor. to protect currency risk, bank enter currency swap euro exchange kronor today agreement exchange kronor back euro predetermine rate five years’ time. in way bank match currency asset (the mortgages) liability thereby eliminate currency risk. the swedish bank thus dependent acquire kronor long-term counterparty currency swap. they principle three ways: foreign bank, another swedish bank insurance company. today, often foreign bank act counterparty swaps. the foreign bank usually natural access swedish kronor. they therefore fund part lend kronor borrow kronor short-term swedish banks. however, risk foreign investor leave swedish market problem arise, swedish krona small currency. there also reason believe number foreign bank act counterparties swedish bank limited. moreover, participate swap market often central part operation foreign banks. this turn consequence liquidity price swap market. we saw example last extraordinary loan riksbank offer bank crisis mature autumn 2010. uncertainty arise money market, consequently swap counterparties abroad acquire short-term fund kronor swedish bank become le will enter swap agreement swedish banks. it thus become expensive difficult swedish bank convert foreign currency swedish kronor long maturities. to certain extent, swedish bank also act counterparties swaps. however, perspective swedish bank system really matter redistribute maturity risk. the fact bank act counterparties also forge link within swedish bank system even tighter. a natural counterparty swedish bank could swedish life insurance pension companies. these company long-term liability kronor form pension save partly invest asset abroad. at present, company active long-term currency swap market great extent. the swedish bank therefore dependent tight circle counterparties currency swap markets. a small concentrate market mean turn considerable risk disruption contagion effects. bi central bankers’ speech 7 long-term asset short-term fund foreign currency create risk swedish bank substantial asset foreign currency also deposit deficit, dependent market funding. a large part market fund short term, liquidity risk foreign currency also arises. the u dollar currency risk clear. follow collapse lehman brothers, dollar market practically close while, riksbank need lend equivalent almost 250 billion kronor u dollar bank system prevent liquidity risk spread real economy. however, riksbank cannot create liquidity foreign currency way swedish kronor, limit size liquidity risk bank take foreign currency without pose risk financial stability. there therefore good reason bank examine match maturity asset liability foreign currencies. the market bank certificate kronor shrink it long-term fund take place foreign currencies. a large part banks’ short-term fund also take place foreign currencies, mainly u dollar euros. the swedish bank are, example, important counterparties u money-market funds. sweden second-largest european market money-market fund – large unite kingdom germany. although indicate high level confidence swedish banks, also entail risks. during crisis, saw money-market fund among volatile investors. a high degree fund money-market fund also make bank dependent u regulatory framework legislative processes. for short-term fund swedish kronor market bank certificates. however, market shrink (see figure 3). we may wonder market decline dramatically seem incentive maintain it. a thrive domestic market bank certificate kronor would increase banks' scope diversification. their dependence market foreign currency swap market would reduced. although market usually work well swedish bank currently good reputation among investor always need case, saw 2008 2009. we course think create liquid market bank certificate kronor. one problem benefit market fall bank collectively cost form high borrow cost fall bank individually. in perspective may necessary investigate whether cost individual bank pay short-term fund foreign currency reflect true cost swedish financial system swedish society. 8 bi central bankers’ speech figure 3 outstanding certificate issue bank swedish kronor sek billion note. refer certificate issue banks, mortgage institution credit institutions. source: statistic sweden swedish condition require complement reform agenda the swedish bank system thus mark number characteristic make somewhat special international perspective – characteristic either increase risk problem economic cost society problem arise bank sector. there therefore good reason establish safe margin – respectable distance – minimum regulation basel iii accord. a know, already take several step strengthen swedish bank system, commitment basel iii entails. in november 2011, riksbank, ministry finance finansinspektionen announce four major swedish bank would meet capital adequacy requirement 10 per cent risk-weighted asset 1 january year 12 per cent 1 january 2015. all four major bank cet 1 ratio high 10 per cent accord definition basel iii. three bank also 12 per cent. the swedish authority also say bank meet short-term liquidity measure basel iii (the lcr) total separately euro u dollar. this requirement compulsory eight large swedish bank since 1 january year.3 the riksbank also recommend bank improve public information liquidity risk degree encumber assets. this great transparency increase confidence market discipline. i please say banks’ public 3 these nordea, swedbank, handelsbanken, seb, sbab, svensk exportkredit, kommuninvest länsförsäkringar bank. bi central bankers’ speech 9 report improve line riksbank's recommendations, although work still remain do (see table 1). table 1 the banks’ public information liquidity risk these measure contribute relative stability swedish banks. but i don’t think finish yet. the financial system important, risk system must constantly reviewed. let give example area i believe need investigated. a i mention earlier, swedish banks’ high dependence market fund entail increase risk suffer liquidity problem stress situation. it course always possible riksbank lend swedish kronor, unreasonable bank take liquidity risk base expectation riksbank provide extraordinary loan thing go accord plan. the ability bank comply liquidity coverage ratio basel iii accord therefore investigated. the difference maturity banks’ asset liability foreign currency i describe also potential source concern trouble times. the riksbank cannot offer unlimited liquidity currency own. a know, riksbank therefore recently strengthen foreign-exchange reserve situation foreign-exchange market seriously disrupt riksbank able provide extraordinary loan u dollar euros. the aim course strengthen riksbank’s preparedness safeguard basic work financial system thereby help u avoid major economic costs. give swedish bank benefit riksbank’s foreign-exchange reserve, would unreasonable share cost maintain it. if price effective way also give bank incentive reduce currency risks. this would reduce risk financial stability swedish economy. 10 bi central bankers’ speech it course secret also look mortgage loan asset side banks’ balance sheets. a i already point out, banks’ risk weight low. finansinspektionen intend begin apply risk-weight floor 15 per cent banks’ portfolio swedish mortgage loans. the riksbank support proposal risk-weight floor 15 per cent. we also believe good reason analyse whether floor need raise even further. one important reason public sector non-financial company would bear large part risk debt-servicing ability household weaken. i also speak risk arise fact large proportion mortgage loan interest-only loans. in context, swedish bankers’ association’s recommendation mortgage exceed loan-to-value ratio 75 per cent amortise course welcome, although one may ask whether enough. mortgage amortise great extent decade ago, time inflation automatically reduce real debt ratio. i believe amortisation may needed, especially current situation low stable inflation. however, authority impose amortisation requirement may worth review aspect provision loans. one example may different amortisation alternative present borrowers. another may demand borrower financial scope amortise loan certain rate. the important thing restore amortisation culture households’ margin safeguard economy protected. the riksbank focus issue wish safeguard swedish financial system. all analysis measure aim reduce risk sweden incur major economic cost bank sector get trouble. a complement, sweden also need put clear framework macroprudential policy place. the global financial crisis demonstrate need complement traditional financial supervision – micro supervision – focus risk individual institutions, supervision focus risk financial system whole. in january, financial crisis commission present interim report propose responsibility macroprudential policy could allocate sweden. we therefore need consider riksbank's stance issue. a guide principle u body give responsibility macroprudential policy need clear mandate right obligation take action risk arise appropriate tool use limit risks. the discussion macroprudential policy also comprise issue riksbank’s balance sheet, particularly foreign-exchange reserve. a know, inquiry conduct harry flam recently present proposals. here too, riksbank process formulate stance. the public entitle expect authority act prevent manage financial crisis best possible way all thing i talk measure aim reduce risk financial crisis recurring, limit damage financial crisis nevertheless break out. the international process come expression basel iii accord create good regulation bank countries. this also benefit u sweden. over this, however, manage swedish bank system special characteristics. sweden small open economy currency large banks. we need special regulations. this mean we, like number countries, want proceed quickly impose strict requirement basel iii bi central bankers’ speech 11 accord. however, measure take far already clearly strengthen swedish banks. the financial sector central every modern society. we cannot afford recur crisis threaten basic function financial sector. the public entitle expect authority act prevent manage financial crisis best possible way. regulation cover special characteristic structural risk swedish bank sector central instrument work promote financial stability. bi central bankers’ speech 1 guy debelle: some recent (and recent) trend australian debt market address mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, kanganews dcm summit 2013, sydney, 19 march 2013. * * * thank christian vallence tom williams help. thank invite speak again. today, i’m go talk local debt market. i’ll talk current state play well bite history. market development this time last year, debt market globally weren’t great shape, though local market wasn’t fare badly. a year on, global debt market much good position, issuance strong across part market, spread considerably low absolute level yield low historical standards. the market’s assessment likelihood extreme outcome declined. the risk europe still predominantly negative, china, u non-japan asia, risk much balance – one even conceive upside surprises! australia’s financial market influence global factors. at time, domestic market benefit strong international demand australian dollar assets. local issuer continue view favourably offshore investor look diversify credit exposures. yield commonwealth government security move line global government bond yields. they around post-federation lows, long-run graph demonstrate (graph 1). semi-government spread tend move fairly tight range. yield state government debt also around low since federation, notwithstanding occasional rat downgrade. graph 1 2 bi central bankers’ speech demand cgs offshore investor remain strong (graph 2). the share foreign ownership come recent peak net purchase still continued, line pace issuance. there report japanese investor selling, large part high level aud/jpy exchange rate, sale compensate increase purchase investors.1 the foreign ownership semi relatively constant, partly reflect preference foreign official sector generally display sovereign highly rat supranational paper rather state provincial debt. instead, much increase semi supply past couple year meet demand domestic bank balance sheet look boost liquid asset holdings. graph 2 for financial institutions, cost unsecured wholesale debt fall sufficiently make economical replace government guarantee securities. a note recent box statement monetary policy,2 bank begin repurchase debt large amount towards end last year, buyback total around $19 billion since end september (graph 3). a result, contingent liability scheme generate australian government fall quickly imply maturity profile guarantee securities, currently stand $53 billion. 1 some demand asset come official sector. reflect increase official holdings, imf recently announce separately identify australian canadian dollar reserve asset report, alongside five major reserve currencies. give imf move reflect decision already take reserve managers, unlikely reclassification generate new source demand australian dollars. nor imf classification benchmark reserve asset allocation decision major reserve asset managers. instead, move reflect reality evident time. 2 see rba (2013), “box d: buyback government securities”, statement monetary policy, february, pp 54–55. bi central bankers’ speech 3 graph 3 the ability issue cover bond also help repurchase guarantee debt, bank offer investor aaa mandate alternative asset invest in. cover bond enable bank diversify investor base, provide issuer wholesale fund source le sensitive risk event traditional unsecured funding. after strong issuance begin 2012 bank ramp programs, cover bond issuance australian bank slow year progressed, large part reflect banks’ desire spread maturity profile. the major bank utilise around 30 per cent issuance cap date. spread cover bond tighten significantly since first transaction late 2011, reflect general improvement global risk sentiment, also increase familiarity product widen investor pool. australian cover bond price level close much long establish cover bond program (graph 4). 4 bi central bankers’ speech graph 4 graph 5 bi central bankers’ speech 5 the general decline borrow cost second half 2012 help entice number issuer back wholesale market, volume pick across market towards end last year first quarter 2013 (graph 5). in unsecured market, bank continue keep stock term debt relatively constant, is, issuance broadly line maturities. this strategy result number different considerations, include relatively subdue growth balance sheets. but one dominant cause desire maintain strong rating, latent threat downgrade wholesale issuance grow “too large”. this reflect somewhat misplace assessment “deposits good, wholesale fund bad”. a result, bank currently pay price 3-month term deposit 5-year debt issue. bank take advantage increase risk appetite lengthen tenor issuance. the average tenor unsecured issuance 5 year since middle last year, compare little 4 year since begin financial crisis. increase tenor also feature markets. for example, australian office financial management (aofm) extend average tenor cgs issuance 2011/12 year 7.7 years,3 past 12 month tenor corporate issuance increase nearly 11 years, compare average 8 year since begin financial crisis. the securitisation market recently catch trends, lag behind segment debt market. issuance pick late spread tighten considerably follow early sizeable tighten cover bond spreads. encouragingly, recent issuance complete little support aofm due strong private investor demand, primary market spread tight level since 2007 (graph 6). this spread tighten low cost mortgage lend small bank non-bank lender rely securitisation large part funding. graph 6 3 see aofm (2012), australian office financial management annual report 2011–12. available <http://www.aofm.gov.au/content/publications/reports/annualreports/2011-2012/index.asp>. 6 bi central bankers’ speech condition also pick kangaroo market. ten kangaroo issuer debut market 2012. the diversity new issuer also notable feature, include asian name non-financial corporates. another positive development re-emergence non-ssa issuer see since start global financial crisis, recently number european issuer return market absent much 2012. kangaroo issuance support broad-based reduction spreads, attractive basis, foreign investor look beyond aaa instrument australian dollar exposure. these foreign investor notably active asian investor participation particular continue grow. some recent rba initiative australian debt market i briefly discus two recent rba initiative concern local debt market. firstly, reserve bank process sign two-way credit support annex swap counterparties. a number agreement already operational, include bank’s large counterparties, expect agreement place counterparties come weeks. this move line best practice risk management. a market participant collateralise exposure directions, also free collateral system (in aggregate), enhance liquidity resilience australian derivative markets. secondly, late last year, reserve bank announce new data report requirement repo-eligible rmbs. the information require bank include loan-level transaction specific data issuer must also make publicly available. these initiative design help bank ass quality rmbs provide collateral also improve transparency market whole. for investors, data easy access report template standardised, investor good compare underlie credit characteristic different deals, also use data analytics. the consultation period propose report template close end last year. the bank currently review consultation find finalise report template next month so. a long-run perspective australian corporate bond issuance i turn corporate bond market. non-financial corporate issuance also robust, particularly strong towards end last year, lead large deal mine sector. the december quarter strong record domestic activity, bhp’s $1 billion transaction receive significant interest. the deal large ever non-credit wrap transaction domestic market corporate issuer. to place recent trend longer-term context, i’d like take moment consider australia’s corporate debt market evolve present form. the current corporate bond landscape result number significant development past century, outline recent reserve bank research discussion paper publish late 2012.4 this paper result substantial data collection exercise extend understand australian bond issuance back 1917. broadly speaking, trend bond issuance australian corporation break three distinct period (graph 7). the first, extend throughout first half 4 see black s, j kirkwood, a rai t williams (2012), “a history australian corporate bonds”, rba research discussion paper no 2012–09. bi central bankers’ speech 7 20th century, actually saw peak size corporate bond market relative gdp. this period, particularly prior world war ii, characterise significant issuance government-owned public trade enterprise (ptes). private investment, hand, largely finance internal funds, modest private bond issuance occur mostly fund mine investment, much corporation late go become bhp. graph 7 the bulk issuance government-owned corporation take place 1920s. the proceed use mostly fund public work programs, investment ptes account much 7 per cent gdp. half bond issuance victorian water sanitation board alone. public work project undertake sydney, hand, include build sydney harbour bridge sydney’s underground railway system, mostly fund directly governments. over 1930s 1940s, stock corporate bond outstanding decline government reallocate resource away ptes finance war-related expenditure. by end second world war, corporate bond market shrink around 18 per cent gdp. a economy expand follow world war ii, stock corporate bond remain relatively small share gdp. at time, corporate bond market begin shift towards large share private issuance, part fund mine investment, corporation look source capital outside heavily regulate bank system (graph 8). 8 bi central bankers’ speech graph 8 graph 9 bi central bankers’ speech 9 bond issuance trend change significantly early 1980s onwards australian economy financial system undergo large structural changes. financial deregulation liberalisation late 1970s early 1980s saw bank rely le deposit instead turn capital market fund balance sheet growth. a know, bank bond issuance since grow rapidly, bank become large issuer australian bond (graph 9). some notable trend since early 1980s include large number privatisations, result share quasi-government bond fall close zero, growth asset-backed market. on investor side, compulsory super increase offshore issuance cause shift away direct hold household towards indirect hold superannuation fund non-resident investors. another important development abolition capital control float australian dollar. prior 1980s, range constraint capital flow intend prevent discourage firm undertake foreign borrowing. since control relaxed, bank corporation obtain significant proportion fund offshore bond markets. since 1986, stock bond issue offshore australian resident exceed size onshore market (graph 10). graph 10 the liberalisation capital account also contribute development “kangaroo” bond market. kangaroo issuance also encourage by, contribute to, development active cross-currency interest rate swap market australia. i finish think current state domestic corporate bond market. there fair amount discussion size, liquidity functionality local market. let raise three issue worth considering: • be local corporate sector banked? the u often hold comparator here, respect u exception, size australian corporate bond market similar europe uk example. that doesn’t mean local market shouldn’t bigger, it’s unusual. • in many recent discussion state local market, i room issuer investors. the issuer say enough 10 bi central bankers’ speech demand paper. the investor say enough supply. but actually seem go bid-ask wide. it basically issue price. ironically, discussion often chair investment banks, whose mandate, i would thought, would intermediate issuer investors. • finally, nascent level activity develop different mean finance sub-investment grade corporates traditional bank financing. bank would still credit process potentially package pool sub-investment grade loan security would attractive investors. two issue around strategy are: first, whether margin would attractive enough investor, bank charge credit process; second, whether investors, particularly super sector, credit skill appropriately ass risk price product, give super sector’s corporate skill traditionally confine list corporate sector. bi central bankers’ speech 1 karolina ekholm: monetary policy, business cycle stabilisation macroprudential policy speech m karolina ekholm, deputy governor sverige riksbank, meet confederation swedish enterprise, stockholm, 13 march 2013. * * * the view express speech necessarily share member executive board riksbank. i would like thank kerstin hallsten, kerstin af jochnick, cecilia roos-isaksson, lars e. o. svensson, anders vredin barbro wickman-parak comment magnus wiberg help draft speech. a i sure know, i recent year advocate expansionary monetary policy policy actually conducted. that i do recently, growth swedish economy relatively weak, perhaps surprising. on hand, may difficult understand reason stance 2010, swedish economy growth rate 5 per cent. however, i intend explain today, i believe demand low sweden ever since global financial crisis seriously affect swedish economy autumn 2008. the low level demand ultimately result weak economic development around world, subdue demand swedish export make household company pessimistic. in opinion, however, could counteract expansionary monetary policy. today i intend describe factor view indicate aggregate demand low recent years, explain why, i see it, monetary policy fiscal policy use great extent counteract low demand. my explanation large possibility use monetary policy fiscal policy stabilise aggregate demand limit concern financial stability. even though sweden cop well financial crisis, i believe leave decision-makers feel near-death experience. financial stability therefore come seem far important standard business cycle stabilisation. this prioritisation may well reasonable. however, i believe important swedish economy effective policy business cycle stabilisation time conduct policy promote financial stability. i discus do towards end speech. low aggregate demand since financial crisis when sweden hit collapse demand swedish export product end 2008, gdp fell heavily. however, take long gdp rise 2010 growth

development abroad weaken optimism household companies. the fact unemployment relatively high sweden already prior financial crisis (as see figure 2, unemployment average 7 per cent since 1999) current account surplus substantial since second half 1990s, raise question whether aggregate demand weak even long perspective. my colleague lars e. o. svensson has, example, claim unemployment

the much strong state public finance many country largely consequence fiscal policy framework gradually develop since 1990s.5 this put sweden much good initial position term public finance financial

partly result automatic stabiliser partly result government intervention financial sector deal systemically-important bank experience problems. in countries, scope influence economy use fiscal-policy

public finances. the need save rainy day also probably appear great much easy manage financial crisis public finance strong outset. it reason i believe willingness use fiscal policy stimulate demand

also conduct so-called unconventional monetary policy purchase asset provide liquidity long maturity normal ways.10 all all, lead expansionary monetary policy large part rest world sweden, despite fact repo rate historically low level. the fact swedish monetary policy le expansionary many country may seem reasonable consider swedish economy also perform much good many countries. this particularly true comparison european countries, show figure 1. but, problem monetary policy expansionary enough keep inflation rate around 2 per cent bring unemployment long-run sustainable rate. 11 why hasn’t monetary policy expansionary enough? one reason certain extent overestimate strength duration temporary recovery swedish economy 2010 therefore also overestimate inflationary pressures. another reason fear expansionary monetary policy would increase risk associate household indebtedness. here, event country financial crisis give rise fears. in several country high level household indebtedness high house prices, substantial fall house price lead fall consumption demand, turn weaken development real economy. in areas, also lead high loan loss risk financial stability. risk associate household indebtedness personally, however, i believe risk associate household indebtedness represent weighty argument conduct expansionary monetary policy recently. there course every reason avoid situation house price fall dramatically. however, i find difficult see current development regard house price loan household sweden justify measures. house price households’ debt percentage disposable income rise substantially sweden mid-1990s start financial crisis. a see figure 8, real house price also increase dramatically nordic country period. however, situation different recent years. the rate growth loan household fall significantly debt ratio therefore level out, although historically high level (see figure 9). increase house price also much subdue recent years. a finland, real house price seem 10 in unite states, central bank add liquidity market purchase bonds. the central bank unite kingdom japan also launch extensive asset-purchase programmes. the ecb offer loan european bank form three-year ltro loan (long-term refinance operations). the ecb also announce new support programme, outright monetary transaction (omt) enable unlimited purchase government bond country apply emergency loan thus accept condition loans. 11 in monetary policy report publish july 2012, riksbank’s assessment long-run sustainable unemployment rate interval 5–7.5 per cent. the mid-point estimate interval thus 6.25 per cent. there also estimate long-run sustainable unemployment rate. in late issue report “wage formation sweden”, national institute economic research ass rate around 7 per cent present, fall around 6 per cent year immediately ahead (see wage formation sweden 2012, national institute economic research). accord calculation lars svensson deviation actual inflation rate inflation target affect unemployment, mid-point riksbank’s estimate interval 5.5 per cent (see “correction riksbank’s estimate long-run sustainable unemployment rate”, appendix 2,

whether development pose risk financial macroeconomic stability. the development household indebtedness could lead problem house price begin fall reason unemployment begin increase sharply connection downturn. in order ass extent constitute risk need analyse risk fall house price extent level debt make household vulnerable. in case latter, important determine asset household addition housing. the relatively high level private save sweden advantage lead situation household relatively substantial financial asset (see figure 9). analyse risk fall house price easy, natural start point try find good indicator price fall base experience gain countries. accord study imf, likelihood fall house price increase growth loan percentage gdp high, current account deficit house investment high relation gdp.12 put simply, one say risk fall house price high economy loan-financed build boom loan largely back fund abroad rather domestic saving. credit growth indeed relatively high sweden number years, basis indicator reason believe increase risk fall house prices. however, situation regard current account house investment rather opposite associate increase risk price falls. a i mention earlier, sweden substantial surplus current account case many years. figure 4 also illustrate development number country house price fallen, ireland, spain unite states, see current account deficit relatively substantial countries. one explanation relatively low level overall investment sweden, one factor behind current account surplus, fact low level investment house (see figure 10). there thus sign credit growth experience finance build boom associate low level domestic saving. in recent years, number new-builds house sector sweden around 20 000 per year, low figure historical terms.13 the low level new house construction thus important factor behind rise house prices.14 12 when three factor deviate significantly normal pattern time, 56 per cent probability substantial fall house prices. see imf (2009), world economic outlook, october. 13 this level last 50 year low year 1990s (statistics sweden, 2012 “housing construction low long time”, scb economic indicator, no. 2012:92). 14 peter englund, among others, point low level house construction sweden one reason sharp increase prices; see englund, peter (2011), “swedish house price international perspective”, chapter i.1 the riksbank’s inquiry risk swedish house market. 12 bi central bankers’ speech figure 10. house investment proportion gdp per cent note. average value 2001–2007 2008–2010. no figure available 2010 case ireland japan, red bar refer 2008–2009. source: vredin et al. (2012), report economic policy group 2012. simple rules, difficult time – stabilisation policy need changed? other indicator fall house price also proposed, example positive deviation house price long-term trend, present relatively high sweden.15 however, point picture provide typical indicator fall house price mix sweden. some appear alarm others practically opposite typically case fall house prices. this course mean certain price fall, still important background clear order able ass risk house market. if development period ahead seem justify take measure dampen house price household indebtedness, i nevertheless doubtful use repo rate this. it would good reduce level loan-to-value ceiling finansinspektionen recommend bank stay below, raise banks’ risk weight mortgages.16 another alternative would reduce tax deduction interest payment somewhat. unlike repo-rate increases, measure aim directly mortgages. these course measure lie within riksbank’s mandate, everyone’s interest ensure risk associate swedish house market manage effectively. so i use repo rate influence house price household indebtedness? the main reason cost – form inflation target 15 for example, borio drehmann (2009) present indicator financial crisis base trend deviation private loan percentage gdp property price paper “assessing risk bank crisis – revisited”. the latter component intend capture likelihood magnitude fall property prices. 16 finansinspektionen recently propose floor 15 per cent risk weight mortgages. this floor could raise seem need dampen banks’ lend house purposes. 0246810120246810122001-20072008-2010 bi central bankers’ speech 13 unemployment – appear high relation rather uncertain gains. most analysis indicate policy rate little impact house price thus also household indebtedness.17 use repo rate would justify see credit boom throughout swedish economy. but seeing. household indebtedness increase approximately rate disposable incomes. the rate growth bank lend company typically vary business cycle, present rate low (see figure 11). all all, credit growth relatively low swedish economy. figure 11. lend household company monetary financial institution annual percentage change source: the riksbank. another problem use monetary policy influence household indebtedness also impact exchange rate. all else equal, high interest rate lead strong currency and, else equal, strong currency lead low inflation low resource utilisation. there thus clear cost associate use monetary policy way. the alternative – good one – separate monetary policy policy aim promote financial stability. this could do establish effective framework macroprudential policy policy aim counteract risk financial system whole. 17 see example kuttner, kenneth (2012), “low interest rate house bubbles: still no smoke gun”, publication the role central bank financial stability: how ha changed?, claussen, carl andreas, magnus jonsson björn lagerwall (2011), “a

institutionscompanieshouseholds 14 bi central bankers’ speech a separate macroprudential policy in january 2013, financial crisis commission present interim report discusses, among things, financial crisis prevent sweden. the commission propose set council macroprudential policy. this would entail exist council cooperation macroprudential policy riksbank finansinspektionen establish law complement independent expert observer ministry finance. the council also work develop macroprudential policy instruments, analyse risk discus appropriate measures. the intention responsibility decide whether apply macroprudential policy instrument would lie either finansinspektionen riksbank. the commission’s proposal well-reasoned wise, but, i see it, one flaw: unclear ultimately responsible conduct macroprudential policy. a usually question take measure unpopular – example limit possibility household borrow money way restrict choice live, limit possibility financial company earn money – vital someone make responsible ensure measure actually taken. this may well be, commission suggests, riksbank finansinspektionen. however, i sceptical authority responsible, easy blame crisis actually develops.18 it course natural riksbank play central role macroprudential policy, financial stability precondition macroeconomic stability risk financial stability therefore analyse ongoing basis.19 however, responsibility macroprudential policy may potentially come conflict independence riksbank field monetary policy. this independence base realisation politically-governed monetary policy tend inflationary, may tempt political reason renege promise low inflation conduct inflationary monetary policy reduce unemployment short-term.20 however, independence go hand hand clearly-defined objective monetary policy constantly evaluated. macroprudential policy different nature, objective prevent crises. it course possible constantly register whether crisis occur not, crisis occur difficult determine whether measure take well-designed not. a case unpopular measures, one might think would advantage decision make people practice cannot dismissed. but may particularly good solution democratic point view. at time, macroprudential policy may address issue macroeconomic stability way come close monetary policy aim achieve. the historically-high level household indebtedness sweden perhaps first instance pose risk financial crisis macroeconomic development long term. a fall house price connection economic slowdown increase unemployment could lead severe downturn household react significantly increase save compensate decline wealth.21 this risk relate financial macroeconomic 18 similar criticism express colleague kerstin af jochnick speech “monetary policy macroprudential policy”, 25 january 2013. 19 the european systemic risk board (esrb) highlight role central bank recommendation institutional framework national macroprudential policy (see recommendation european systemic risk board 22 december 2011 macroprudential mandate national authorities). 20 see example kydland, finn edward prescott (1977), “rules rather discretion: the

sheet macroeconomic assessment”. bi central bankers’ speech 15 imbalance rather financial stability. they also imbalance must view much long perspective perspective usually adopt make decision repo rate. financial macroeconomic imbalance type course result financial crises, automatically. we therefore distinguish avoid imbalance avoid crisis threaten financial system. in case i believe need active policy alongside standard stabilisation policy. i sure everyone agree riksbank central role play analyse emergence financial macroeconomic imbalances. however, role riksbank come decide measure counteract imbalance long term open question present. in view, important macroprudential policy put place separate policy area. this would good financial stability, also good macroeconomic stabilisation. the proposal financial crisis commission circulate comment i member executive board riksbank formulate joint response proposal spring. conclusion i thus believe many indication demand weak swedish economy principle case ever since autumn 2008. one exaggerate expectation monetary policy achieve come reduce relatively high level unemployment sweden. however, long inflation expect clearly target 2 per cent i believe scope use monetary policy try alleviate situation labour market. i argue one reason fiscal policy monetary policy use actively increase demand swedish economy concern financial stability. the risk public finance radically weaken government force intervene support bank crisis seem argument cautious public finance present. the risk low interest rate increase household indebtedness turn increase vulnerability household if, example, house price fall reason put forward argument low repo rate.22 personally, i believe latter risk particularly serious present rate increase lend household decline significantly since financial crisis. nevertheless, risk take account monetary policy decisions. all all, therefore, economic policy sufficiently counteract effect weak development abroad pessimistic household companies. how establish effective policy business cycle stabilisation sweden without time expose economy considerable risk regard financial stability? one important step establish separate policy area explicit responsibility prevent financial crises. if succeed create effective framework policy area, monetary policy would good able focus main tasks: stabilise inflation around inflation target resource utilisation around sustainable level. the interim report financial crisis commission, proposal set council macroprudential policy, welcome context.

include labor supply demand condition follow reduction excess capacity manufacture sector surplus labor rural areas, well supply demand condition resources. attention therefore need pay risk change impose constraint chinese economy. on hand, so-called shale revolution unite state may buoy u.s. economy decline energy material prices. with regard japanese economy, various economic measure likely boost growth rate time being; meantime, however, uncertainty extent economic measure promote virtuous circle firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectation rise result progress regulatory reforms. a prices, attention need pay possibility materialization aforementioned risk economic activity could exert considerable effect development prices, include supply demand balance. ii. monetary policy “price stability target” next, i would like turn bank’s conduct monetary policy current economic price situation. in order japan’s economy overcome deflation early possible return sustainable growth price stability, bank pursue aggressive monetary easing. at monetary policy meet hold january 21 22, 2013, bank take decisive additional step provide monetary accommodation. specifically, bank decide introduce (1) “price stability target” place “price stability goal medium long term”, (2) “open-ended asset purchase method” asset purchase program. furthermore, bank release “joint statement government bank japan overcome deflation achieve sustainable economic growth” 4 bi central bankers’ speech government. in addition, provide strong support lend financial institutions, bank make effort ensure firm household make use accommodative financial conditions. in follows, i explain aim of, think behind, bank’s policy measures. a. introduction “price stability target” 2 percent 1. what “price stability”? i would like explain detail “price stability target”. the bank conduct monetary policy base principle monetary policy shall aim “achieving price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy”. on basis, i would like explain price development bank perceive “price stability” reason set target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi. “price stability” define conceptually state various economic agent may make decision regard economic activity consumption investment without concern fluctuation general price level, must achieve sustainable basis. the bank consider “price stability” situation economy improve balance sustainable manner, accompany increase employment, wages, corporate profits, price rise moderately result. to put simply, bank aim achieve “price stability target” create environment corporate profit wage rise sustainable manner primarily reflect increase productivity. for example, import price rise, may push inflation rate, increase inflation accompany improvement economy term trade deteriorate real income household firm fall. this type inflation bank aim achieve. in japan, give inflation hover low level close 0 percent year year prolong period, low inflation expectation become entrench firms’ households’ decision making. give this, “price stability target” 2 percent may see somewhat high. however, i explain earlier, year-on-year rate change cpi project move close 1 percent fiscal 2014 support recovery economy. if, situation, effort wide range entity raise competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy bear fruit firms’ households’ inflation expectation rise result, inflation rate consistent price stability sustainable basis rise well fiscal 2014. the bank continue provide support financial side measure pursue aggressive monetary ease support strengthen foundation economic growth order underpin sign recovery currently seen. the bank utmost cpi rise steadily target 2 percent target achieve early possible time. 2. inflation mechanism now, i would like briefly explain mechanism inflation rate rises. from somewhat long-term perspective, mild positive correlation rate increase cpi aggregate supply demand balance. if, result improvement economy, aggregate demand economy whole increase relative production capacity and, therefore, balance aggregate supply demand improves, rate increase cpi rise time lag several quarters. since mid-1990s, japan’s economy tend face shortage aggregate demand rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) moderate decline trend since latter half 1990s, exception 2007 2008. the aggregate supply demand balance reach nearly minus 8 percent lehman shock, although recently narrow minus 2 3 percent, upward bi central bankers’ speech 5 momentum price sufficiently strong. this shortage demand reflect cyclical factor also structural ones. a result globalization unparalleled decline birth rate age population, environment surround japan’s economy change dramatically economic structure slow adapt. a consequence, economic growth decline trend, low growth expectations, turn lead chronic shortage demand. due shortage, many firm cut costs, mainly reduce wages. despite efforts, however, corporate profit increase fierce price competition prevent firm raise price goods. consequently, unable foresee clear improvement profits, firm inevitably turn cautious increase fix investment, employment, wages. 3. importance strengthen growth potential in order overcome situation, essential strengthen growth potential economy raise firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectation resolve chronic shortage demand. because impossible halt decline birth rate age population short run, prerequisite strengthen growth potential economy secure labor force raise value add per worker (value-added productivity). in order secure labor force, important (1) make labor market flexible, (2) make easy labor move one industry another woman elderly participate labor market. if situation remain unaddressed labor force continue decline, push japan’s annual economic growth rate 2010s approximately 0.6 percentage point. this population issue unique japan. china’s labor force also start decline 2012, give rise sense crisis. a shrink labor force problem many advance emerge country face near future. in japan, estimate labor force participation rate woman rise level sweden 2030 elderly (those age 60 over) also rise, japanese labor force would increase annual rate 0.2 percent 2010s. a employment elderly, view gradual rise pensionable age national pension 65, start april 2013 mandatory firm provide employment elderly worker wish keep working. give japan succeed shift retirement age 55 60 toward 1980s, possible create society normal work age 65 beyond institutional reform change way people work. to raise value-added productivity, necessary build economic environment innovation broad sense – include development new business model – achieve easily. recently, firm make active effort wide range area capitalize social changes, include business focus elderly, environment energy, information telecommunications. if firm accelerate effort front reorient strategy concentrate price competition competition base new good services, accompany increase labor force value-added productivity, firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectation rise amid vigorous economic activity. b. foster accommodative financial conditions: maintain virtually zero interest rate policy increase asset purchase i explain bank’s powerful monetary ease measure achieve “price stability target” 2 percent. the bank pursue aggressive monetary ease commitment continue virtually zero interest rate policy purchase financial asset long bank judge appropriate. through asset purchase program establish balance sheet, bank purchase various financial asset – japanese government security (jgss), cp, corporate bonds, exchange-traded fund (etfs), japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) – conduct fixed-rate funds-supplying operation pool collateral. the program aim encourage 6 bi central bankers’ speech decline longer-term interest rate various risk premium foster accommodative financial condition firm household raise sufficient fund low interest rates. the size asset purchase program, set 35 trillion yen time establishment october 2010, successively increased, amount outstanding program 65 trillion yen end december 2012. the bank continue significantly increase amount outstanding program reach 101 trillion yen end december 2013. in addition, bank decide monetary policy meet hold january 21 22, 2013 introduce, complete current purchase method, method purchase give amount financial asset every month without set termination date. specifically, january 2014, bank conduct purchase financial asset total 13 trillion yen month time. a result, amount outstanding asset purchase program increase 10 trillion yen 2014 – 111 trillion yen – expect maintain thereafter. c. strengthen policy coordination government bank on january 22, 2013, bank release “joint statement government bank japan overcome deflation achieve sustainable economic growth”. the bank announce set “price stability target” 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi, that, target, would pursue monetary ease aim achieve target early possible time. the bank state would ascertain whether significant risk sustainability economic growth, include accumulation financial imbalances. the government, hand, announce would formulate strongly promote measure strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy, steadily promote measure aim establish sustainable fiscal structure view ensure credibility fiscal management. the government play crucial part strengthen growth potential economy. specifically, strengthen growth potential hinge cumulative effort firm financial institution create expand new business. in context, government play pivotal role fostering, regulatory institutional reforms, environment encourage private sector take new challenges. while bank continue pursue aggressive monetary ease measure large-scale purchase jgss, japan’s fiscal imbalance – among serious world – could hamper effect monetary easing. if credibility japan’s fiscal management falter, interest rate would likely rise, thereby make fiscal management difficult undermine effect monetary easing. in order fully ensure effectiveness monetary easing, important government ensure market credibility fiscal consolidation. in regard, joint statement profound significance show government bank clearly acknowledge other’s role work together overcome deflation achieve sustainable economic growth. d. make use accommodative financial conditions: provide boost loan support program give bank’s aggressive monetary ease i describe earlier, financial condition japan extremely accommodative historical international comparison. to specific, term firms’ fund costs, short- long-term average interest rate new loan contract hit 1 percent – unprecedented level. in term households’ borrow costs, variable mortgage rate 1 percent even 35-year fix mortgage rate around 2 percent. moreover, financial institutions’ lend attitude remain accommodative, issue condition cp corporate bond remain favorable bi central bankers’ speech 7 whole, environment maintain household firm feel secure gain access funds. meanwhile, even time strong headwind generate great east japan earthquake european debt problem, extremely accommodative financial condition firmly maintained. in order japan’s economy achieve sustainable growth price stability, important firm household actually make use accommodative financial condition fund increase investment spending, turn lead improvement aggregate supply demand balance. a recent development credit demand, although firm show sign increase demand mainly work capital fund relate merger acquisitions, business fix investment finance cash flows, indicate accommodative financial condition use full possible extent. to promote full use accommodative financial conditions, bank establish loan support program, consist fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth (hereafter growth-supporting fund facility) fund-provisioning measure stimulate bank lend (hereafter stimulate bank lend facility). these facility offer use. 1. the growth-supporting fund facility the growth-supporting fund facility introduce aim support flow fund area growth potential. with facility, bank provide long-term fund low interest rate financial institution lend investment area expect contribute strengthen japan’s growth potential, medical nurse care; environment energy; agriculture, forestry, fisheries; tourism. in addition lend arrangement main rules, bank establish special rule lend arrangement extend loan financial institution equity investment asset-based lend (abl). in abl, asset account receivable inventory use eligible collateral. moreover, bank establish special rule another lend arrangement small-lot investment loan well u.s. dollar lend arrangement 12 billion u.s. dollar – equivalent 1 trillion yen – use u.s. dollar reserve already hold bank, foreign currency-denominated investment loans. the total size lend arrangement make growth-supporting fund facility set 5.5 trillion yen, nearly 4 trillion yen already disburse bank. the amount lend investment actually provide financial institution use facility greatly exceed amount loan disburse bank. this indicate bank’s measure produce positive effect catalyst. 2. the stimulate bank lend facility in october 2012, bank introduce stimulate bank lend facility aim prompt financial institution take active stance stimulate great proactive credit demand firm households. with facility, bank provide long-term yen-denominated fund low cost financial institution increase lending, request, amount equivalent net increase lend period 15 month end march 2014. the lending, base net increase calculated, either yen-denominated foreign currency-denominated. while may extraordinary central bank support lend – particularly foreign-currency denominate lend – firm locate overseas lend domestic financial institutions’ overseas offices, japanese firms’ international operation well financial institutions’ activity provide fund operation essential capture global demand, bank’s measure support lend contribute strengthen japan’s growth potential. base recent lend data, amount fund provide stimulate bank lend facility expect reach 15 trillion yen end march 2014. 8 bi central bankers’ speech e. quantitative aspect monetary ease the bank provide massive amount fund exceed 50 trillion yen end march 2014 asset purchase program loan support program, amount outstanding program exceed 120 trillion yen. look amount fund disburse bank term monetary base, ratio relative nominal gdp japan currently 27 percent, high level among advance economies. when consider additional fund 50 trillion yen provided, ratio rise 10 percentage point almost 40 percent. a figure show, bank proceed unprecedentedly massive monetary ease year. on basis, continue closely examine financial economic environment, make policy decision timely appropriate manner. if large amount fund provide low cost basis accommodative financial condition utilize effectively invigorate corporate activity, bring improvement firms’ profit prospect increase expect rate return new investment. once virtuous circle take hold, accommodative financial condition even strong effects, virtuous circle become sustainable. a mention earlier, “price stability” achieve situation economy improve balance sustainable manner, accompany increase employment, wages, corporate profits, price rise moderately result. the bank utmost fulfill responsibility achieve “price stability target”. bi central bankers’ speech 1 graeme wheeler: decision make reserve bank new zealand speech mr graeme wheeler, governor reserve bank new zealand, university auckland business school, auckland, 7 march 2013. * * * i’m sure central bank furthest thing mind british mountaineer, eric langmuir aptly said: “a decision without pressure consequence hardly decision all”. central banker often criticise avoid decisions, although leave policy set unchanged often major decision itself. sometimes accuse communicate secret code real mean know central bankers. so undertake important policy decision reserve bank endeavour communicate? i) operational independence in 1990, reserve bank become first modern central bank legislate structure government take lead set objective, central bank operational independence in, formal accountability for, execution monetary policy. new zealand also lead way flexible inflation targeting, framework widely adopt central bank across oecd region. the 1989 reserve bank new zealand act state “the primary function reserve bank formulate implement monetary policy direct economic objective achieve maintain stability general level prices”. the legislation create provision policy target agreement (pta) minister finance governor bank. in practice, pta define objective bank, specify inflation range represent price stability outline consideration bank must give weight frame monetary policy decisions. the current pta, sign 20 september 2012, introduce goal keep future average cpi inflation near two percent target mid-point one percent three percent range. like predecessor ptas, also require bank seek avoid unnecessary instability output, interest rates, exchange rate. the governor’s responsibility obligation confer impose 1989 reserve bank new zealand act, 2009 amlcft act, 2010 insurance (prudential supervision act), expect add non-bank deposit taker legislation currently house. the governor power act bank matter within ambit act require deal board reserve bank (which relate appointment, remuneration removal deputy governors). the governor may delegate decision make authority officer bank. ii) the bank’s span responsibility the reserve bank full service central bank responsibility broad central banks. not central bank responsible prudential regulatory oversight bank payment systems, authority undertake exchange rate intervention. in addition, bank extensive programme financial stability-related initiative underway include open bank resolution, introduction macro-prudential instruments, review payment system, implementation basel iii capital requirements. the bank also take responsibility anti-money launder regulation insurance company non-bank deposit takers. 2 bi central bankers’ speech iii) important check balance the check balance accountability mechanism relate bank considerable include: • publication annual report, least two monetary policy statement (we four), two semi-annual financial stability reports. the bank’s report review parliament’s finance expenditure committee, board director reserve bank, bank provide press conference around monetary policy statement financial stability report. • external audit bank’s financial reporting, oversight audit committee reserve bank board, strong in-house internal audit function report governor work closely board’s audit committee. • publication regulatory impact assessment prudential policy adopts. • monitor oversight board director reserve bank, act agent minister finance review well bank meet legislative responsibilities. the board review bank’s performance pta, effort promote maintenance sound efficient financial system. in consider bank’s monetary policy decisions, director receive paper discuss bank’s monetary policy committee, write advice governor receive individual member monetary policy committee, webcasts governor’s press conferences. the board meet nine time year (four time year outside wellington reception hold business community) provide advice governor various management issues. the board ass bank’s performance meet obligation responsibilities, discus minister finance, publish review bank’s annual report. • the minister finance’s power reserve bank new zealand act direct bank formulate implement monetary policy different economic objective specify section 8, determine basis foreign exchange intervention bank. the coercive power exercisable register bank may exercise minister, consent. these power must exercise transparently, date used. iv) the policy decision make framework in order assist major policy decisions, recently introduce govern committee, comprise governor, two deputy governor assistant governor, chairmanship governor. the govern committee discus major monetary financial policy decision fall bank’s responsibilities, include decision monetary policy, foreign exchange intervention, liquidity management policy, prudential policy (both micro macro) regulatory policies. to date, individual governor take responsibility particular area bank, operations, monetary policy financial stability. go forward governor individual collective involvement key decision take across area bank. this decision make framework adopt bank canada, also single decision maker model. a bank canada, governor retain right veto committee decisions. the committee formalise expand past practice. several central banks, include central bank brazil, mexico, sweden, make monetary policy central committee comprise governors, although sometimes internal member included. these committee benefit decision make pool knowledge, wisdom, expertise individual governors. such committee bi central bankers’ speech 3 bring strength, especially considerable uncertainty involved, mitigate extreme preference individual. the bank’s governor team extensive experience inside outside reserve bank. while change represent management rather governance initiative, govern committee maximise knowledge experience governor individually collective, rigorously test idea build consensus around major policy decisions. analytical policy paper discuss several important committee include monetary policy committee, macro-financial committee, financial system oversight committee, asset liability committee (which examine impact portfolio decision change relative price bank’s balance sheet). these committee clear term reference, mainly meet fortnightly, chair governor. usually decision take committee meeting, major complex policy decision often refer govern committee. management decision take weekly meet bank’s senior management group communication issue request discuss weekly communication committee. v) communicate policy decision we expand on-the-record speak increase number speeches, broaden range topic remain within reserve bank’s framework, increase number speakers. at time, bank continue extensive off-the-record brief group range size 15 400 people, become selective 80–100 brief provide year. we also expand communication social media, in-house videos, webcasts online channels. we provide considerable background brief media, announce policy decision publications, speeches, press conferences. we also provide six-monthly brief caucus political parties, redesign website expand information content increase accessibility. to effective, monetary policy require transparency term policy goal achieved. the former contain policy target agreement; latter monetary policy statements, ocr announcements, speech press conferences. in comment monetary policy decision especially relate official cash rate, conscious trader pre-position prior policy announcement exchange rate interest rate spread alter depend policy decision language accompany it. above all, want policy statement accurately reflect economic conjuncture outlook see it, range consideration weigh fulfil responsibilities. in case monetary policy, include implement monetary policy sustainable, consistent, transparent manner, regard efficiency soundness financial system, seek avoid unnecessary instability output, interest rates, exchange rate. the 90-day interest rate projection contain monetary policy statement form forward guidance expectation movement bank’s official cash rate. it intend help business household plan great confidence manage consumption pattern save investment decisions, help shape expectation future path inflation interest rates. this also help market participant anticipate reserve bank’s policy response new data become available. a conditional projections, interest rate path affect risk uncertainty usually increase time. in practice, balance language around projection least important projection shape expectation outlook. when market expectation adjust smoothly efficiently, diminish need large policy adjustment central bank could otherwise unsettle market great impact asset price spend decisions. 4 bi central bankers’ speech conclude comment global financial market still deal major regulatory change massive adjustment take place government, corporate, financial sector household balance sheet economy generate around two third world output three quarter cross border capital flows. the spill-overs adjustment fiscal monetary response especially challenge small open economy strong growth prospects, high expectation central bank achieve. the reserve bank endeavour provide accurate assessment implication challenge adjustment new zealand economy. in so, seek clear cannot influence, government policy instrument private sector response increase effectiveness. at time we’ve extend regulatory oversight, build protection available taxpayer event bank failure, increase range scope instrument help deliver price stability increase efficiency soundness domestic financial system. within bank look team governor debate major policy matter lead decisions, increase frequency scope on-the-record reporting. bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr: the philippine economy – prime sustainable solid growth speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor bangko sentral ng pilipinas (the central bank philippines), euromoney philippine investment forum, manila, 12 march 2013. * * * secretary cesar purisima, government officials, mr. tony shale, ceo euromoney institutional investor asia, distinguish leader member business investor community, honor guests, lady gentlemen, good afternoon. over recent period, welcome spate rosy positive commentary philippine economy. we describe emerge asian tiger. the venerable new york time label philippine economic bright spot asia. the world bank observe macroeconomic stability new normal philippines. the imf single philippine country whose growth forecast upgraded. the imf 2013 growth forecast set 4.7 percent early revise twice reach 6 percent january.1 the imf multilateral financial institution upgrade growth forecast philippine economy. the world bank upgrade outlook philippines’ 2013 economic growth 5 percent (october) 6.2 percent

receive philippine even credit rat many country downgraded. in fact, could say financial market already vote philippine investment grade evident price credit default risk range investment grade economies. all assessment drive mainly solid performance philippine economy across various metrics. these include: • robust broad-based economic growth; • low stable inflation; • strong external

2012 3 asian development outlook 2012 2 bi central bankers’ speech • sound stable bank system; • much improve fiscal performance. these macroeconomic condition happen chance. far it. in fact, trend noteworthy happen backdrop persistent strong headwind global economy. the progress economic front outcome prudent discipline monetary fiscal policymaking. and condition sustainable strong well-grounded policy framework place. these include: 1. the government commit sound fiscal policy. the government appropriately focus strengthen quality fiscal adjustments. it increase spend critical social priority economic infrastructure keep watchful eye medium-term objective fiscal consolidation. 2. the government continue pursue reform agenda aim raise economy’s flexibility unlock country’s growth potential. 3. a forward-looking monetary policy framework help strengthen commitment non-inflationary economic growth. we meet inflation target past consecutive four year (2009–2012), even economy’s engine power ahead; 4. an enhance policy toolkit gear respond challenge bring strong capital inflows; 5. finally, supervisory regulatory practice benchmarked international best practices. this reflect well-capitalized better-governed bank able efficiently perform financial intermediation risk management. there therefore fundamental reason believe continue macroeconomic discipline reform push growth trajectory path allow economy survive global headwind adapt thrive challenge operate environment. a aware headway made, equally mindful challenge risk favorable economic outlook. i assure lot “responsible adults” room. these policymakers attentive overt well underappreciated risk philippine growth story. what challenges? what latent pressure point economy? let cite three major ones, bsp’s standpoint: 1. manage capital flow surge – issue repeatedly mention morning 2. ensure financial stability 3. go distance structural reform in challenge period strong capital flow expectation continue strong capital flows, one economist call whipsaw huge capital movements, question – monetary authority still firepower yet market-friendly policy responses? to this, response yes. the bsp recognize long ago need deploy deep toolkit address contemporary challenge confront emerge market central bank receive end strong capital flows. it use variety instrument achieve low stable inflation, prevent excessive volatility exchange rate maintain broad financial stability. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a result bsp’s signature circumspection, evidence suggest sizable fx inflow lead significant adverse macroeconomic financial consequences. • reserve accumulation response surge capital inflow appear lead excessive money creation. • the limit impact capital flow monetary aggregate growth suggest sterilization policy broadly effective. • credit growth contribute macroeconomic imbalances, inflation remain low. a second – relate – challenge need ensure continue financial stability. the recent global financial crisis show sole focus price stability sufficient attain macroeconomic stability. policymakers need deliver stable price achieve sustain stable growth. price stability guarantee financial stability. the bsp, therefore, attentive pressure point could impact price stability financial stability. to ensure financial stability utilize prudential measure manage capital inflow moderate, prevent, build-up excess specific sector bank system. prudential policy instrument choice employ first line defense financial stability risks. give current regime low interest rate – drive large part surge foreign capital domestic financial market limit absorptive capacity economy short term – bsp keep watchful eye development asset markets. we pay particular attention happen equity property markets, market interest-rate sensitive could prone bubbly behavior. we see activity market buoyant, key indicator grow broadly within trend, reflect cyclical well structural fundamental forces. it also important note indebtedness philippine still quite low. domestic credit-to-gdp ratio 50.4 percent (q4 2012) still rank one low region.4 this would suggest risk excessive leverage le threat financial stability likewise lower, asset price correct. the third challenge involve go distance pursuit reform agenda. 1. we implement capital adequacy framework basel iii january 2014. we also closely study build block basel iii reform agenda see incorporate domestic regulatory environment. 2. capital market reform priority. this include ensure appropriate market infrastructure place. the infrastructure improve quality markets, help mitigate financial stability risk. but infrastructure also promote absorption inflows, ultimately lead expansion economy. by improve financial intermediation system, well-functioning capital market help unlock economy’s productive potential strengthen capacity withstand shocks. right now, see economy even keel, sure footing, poise high growth, rid momentum change offer promise strong growth also one inclusive durable. 4 note: late available: indonesia 40.2; malaysia 133.3; singapore 151.8; thailand 129.4; japan 221.2; china 153.1; korea 104.1 4 bi central bankers’ speech the challenge keep momentum positive change strong. the appropriate response current favorable wind sit back relax, pop champagne cork william ask morning, treat ideal opportunity strengthen underpinnings economy’s foundations. the bsp strive monetary policy provide environment credit liquidity growth remain supportive economic growth maintain price stability. we also continue work reform deepen financial system. we continue monitor financial asset market responsive emerge risks. we continue work government push agenda

subbarao, governor reserve bank india, london school economics, london, 13 march 2013. * * * first many thank london school economics invite deliver fifth i.g. patel memorial lecture. it honour i attach immense value. dr. i.g. patel 2. dr. i.g. patel represent special bond two institution – reserve bank i represent lse lecture instituted. dr. patel lead institution great dignity distinction, love respect institutions. 3. because occasion demand it, i must repeat i say reserve bank’s platinum jubilee celebration 2010. 4. those interest history science would know sir isaac newton known, among things, also intellectual arrogance. when friend rival, robert hooke write him, laud theory gravity, newton, arrogance, write back uncharacteristic humility: “if i able see little farther others, i stand shoulder giants.” 5. that statement i relate to. a governor reserve bank excite times, i owe intellectual debt gratitude extraordinary men lead reserve bank several challenges, make mark economic history india. among distinguish dr. i.g. patel. i privilege lineage him. 6. during long illustrious career india, dr. patel make significant last contribution economic governance india. he governor reserve bank critical time indian economy battle balance payment crisis trigger second oil price shock late 1970s. he play active role secure accommodation india imf’s extend fund facility, arrangement large fund’s history time. 7. indeed, dr. patel intellectual force behind resolve big macroeconomic challenge time. a governor reserve bank today, i involve address india’s current macroeconomic challenges. the leadership predecessor provide confront challenge always remain source motivation inspiration navigate challenges. i think best way i honour memory late dr. i.g. patel talk india’s current macroeconomic challenge reserve bank’s perspective. india – current macroeconomic context 8. india clock average growth 9.5 per cent three year period global financial crisis (2005-08). for nation believe “hindu rate growth” destiny, remarkable growth performance cause celebration. it also trigger set aspiration double digit growth. 9. today, sharp reversal. growth decelerated, inflation still high stubborn, investment rate decline sharply external sector beset 2 bi central bankers’ speech record high current account deficit. this downturn cause widespread anxiety may get derail high growth trajectory. it also raise number questions. be growth story faltering? ha india’s potential growth rate declined? be growth driver work way 2003–08 still intact? ha world lose confidence india’s growth promise? when reach double digit growth, indeed get there? 10. my short answer question india growth story still credible long term growth driver still intact. if right things, get back high growth trajectory. equally, nothing inevitable india growth story. we accelerate growth improve welfare effectively implement wide range economic governance reforms. slip amount costly potentially irreversible squander away opportunities. 11. the government center lead process economic revival. a central bank regulator large segment financial sector, reserve bank important role play this. what i propose today discus important macroeconomic challenge reserve bank’s perspective. 12. in particular, i discus three challenges: (i) manage growth-inflation dynamic (ii) mitigate vulnerability external sector (iii) manage political economy fiscal consolidation first challenge: manage growth-inflation dynamic growth 13. the global financial crisis affect virtually every economy world, india exception. but recover crisis much sooner even emerge economies. in crisis year 2008/09, growth drop 6.7 per cent, recover smartly thereafter. in fact, two year crisis, 2008/09 2009/10, growth average 9.0 per cent compare favourably average growth 9.5 per cent three year crisis. however, last year, 2011/12, growth moderate 6.2 per cent, first advance estimate suggest growth year may drop 5.0 per cent, low decade (chart-1). 14. to understand late downtrend, important first understand pre-crisis growth surge. several explanation offer india’s growth acceleration pre-crisis period: impact economic reform 1990s; india’s rapid integration global economy; rise entrepreneurism; increase productivity. 15. underlie factor massive increase capacity investment jump 26.9 per cent gdp 2003/04 38.1 per cent 2007/08 (chart-2). this increase investment finance grow domestic saving, accompany increase productivity drive improvement technology, organization, financial intermediation external domestic competitiveness. the current account deficit (cad) period average 0.3 per cent gdp suggest contribution foreign save domestic investment relatively modest. but extent foreign save come way foreign direct investment (fdi), raise productivity overall investment result high exports. 16. in immediate post-crisis period, even investment slowed, private consumption demand, account 57 per cent gdp, hold rural income grow robustly back crisis drive stimulus well expand safety-net programme government. this keep growth also fuel inflation reflect excess demand supply. bi central bankers’ speech 3 17. so, explain downturn growth last two years? the answer would slow demand across board. private investment decelerate sharply, part reflect global downturn, largely owe domestic factors. business profitability dent tighten infrastructure constraint increase input price stem high food fuel inflation. business confidence hit rise fiscal deficit, vacillate commitment reform governance concerns, dampen investor perception return investment. 18. on top decline private investment, private consumption demand, bulwark quick recovery crisis, start slow recent year exacerbate growth slowdown (chart-3). it estimate slow 4.1 per cent current year, average 8.3 per cent previous two years. inflation 19. just india recover crisis sooner countries, inflation catch u sooner elsewhere. inflation, measure wholesale price index (wpi), go briefly negative territory month 2009 start rise sharply thereafter, clock peak rate 10.9 per cent april 2010. average wpi inflation 9.6 per cent fiscal year 2010/11, 8.9 per cent 2011/12 7.5 per cent first ten month 2012/13 (chart-4). the story therefore 8.7 per cent, average inflation last three year high average inflation 5.4 per cent previous decade (2000–10) what drive inflation? 20. both supply side demand side factor contribute buildup inflationary pressures. 21. a major driver supply side food inflation, structural cyclical components. the structural component arise rise incomes, especially rural areas, lead shift dietary habit cereal protein foods. inflation protein food price remain double digit much last three year bar month (chart-5). the cyclical component food inflation arise monsoon relate spike price food item vegetables. notwithstanding talk drought proof economy, timely onset monsoon spatial temporal distribution continue influence inflation outlook india. 22. the second major factor drive current episode inflation global commodity prices, especially price crude oil. india import 80 per cent oil demand. the global price oil therefore important variable determine inflation outlook. the depreciation rupee, start october 2011, compound inflationary impact oil prices. 23. if domestic petroleum sector free market global price pass domestic prices, demand would arguably decline response rise prices. but demand adjustment block administer (subsidized) price regime petroleum products. 24. subsidization not, however, protect u inflation pressure – cost subsidy raise fiscal deficit fuel inflation. so, soften inflation gain subsidization offset large fiscal deficit. 25. there debate india macroeconomic welfare dimension subsidy financed, government surpluses, government borrowing. an argument de-subsidization inflationary. sure, inflationary short-term, price pressure even medium term. also, inflation impact overstated. to extent low subsidy result low fiscal deficit, would 4 bi central bankers’ speech disinflationary impact even short-term. finally, reduction subsidy remove price distortions, improve efficiency provide much good investment environment. 26. the third major factor fuel inflation wage pressures. nominal rural wage increase double digit rate last five years. indeed, increase rapidly that, despite high retail inflation, real wage growth surge close double digit last three year (table-1). the government’s social safety-net programme contribute to, sustained, wage-price spiral. in economy per caput income u $1500, increase income quickly translate increase consumption demand exactly witness india. producer able, recently, pas high input price form high output price without sacrifice margins. growth-inflation dynamic 27. india’s growth-inflation dynamic pre-crisis post-crisis present study contrast. in three year period crisis, economy expand 9.5 per cent average, aid growth fix investment 15 per cent per year. this expand production capacity match grow demand keep core inflation check. post-crisis, story reversed. investment decline half pre-crisis rate whereas consumption demand remain pre-crisis level last year, owe partly government’s entitlement welfare programmes, open positive output gap 2009–11 stoke core inflation. two question growth-inflation dynamic 28. the growth-inflation dynamic recent year i briefly summarize raise two interest relate policy questions. the first india’s potential growth rate second inflation persist elevate level even face steeply moderate output growth. let briefly address them. what india’s potential growth rate? 29. there considerable evidence research do imf bank international settlement (bis) potential growth rate may decline significantly advance emerge economies. india too, despite le integrate global economy emes, see drop potential growth rate. reserve bank estimate show potential growth crisis range 8.0–8.5 per cent. this estimate scale 7.0 per cent crisis owe host factor – decline pace capital formation, supply constraints, especially infrastructure, pressure factor productivity tepid progress reform high fiscal deficit. 30. some analyst contend potential growth rate may dip even reserve bank’s post-crisis estimate 7 per cent. the argument growth dip 7 per cent last year project dip even low year, see inflation current account deficit soften. on hand, inflation persist elevate level current account deficit likely high ever, suggest economy grow beyond capacity potential growth may low even 7 per cent. why india’s growth-inflation dynamic contrarian? 31. the second relate question india’s macroeconomic dynamic contrarian. in particular, last two years, many peer emes also experience growth deceleration, line standard theory, several also see moderation inflation rates. in india, however, inflation come line growth deceleration. several idiosyncratic factor put forward explain uniqueness macroeconomic situation: supply bottlenecks, particularly infrastructure, bi central bankers’ speech 5 sectoral imbalances, rise wage without correspond increase productivity, high fiscal deficit large depreciation exchange rate case peers. reserve bank’s action curb inflation 32. to control inflation, reserve bank reverse crisis period’s accommodative monetary stance quick order. we raise policy interest rate (repo rate) 13 times, cumulatively 375 basis point (bps) – 4.75 per cent 8.5 per cent. also raise reserve requirement bank – cash reserve ratio (crr) – 100 bps 5 per cent 6 per cent. monetary policy know work lags, consequence tight monetary policy, wpi inflation peak 10.9 per cent april 2010, come 6.6 per cent january 2013. 33. in response deceleration growth decline inflation, reserve bank ease monetary policy stance start january 2012 cut repo rate (by 75 bps) crr (by 200 bps). criticism reserve bank’s monetary policy stance 34. the reserve bank criticize anti-inflationary stance. let address main strand criticism illustrate dilemma face manage growth-inflation trade-off. monetary policy stifle growth, tame inflation 35. by far common criticism tight monetary policy stifle growth tame inflation. my response criticism following. first, inflation come peak 4 percentage points. admittedly, growth moderated. however, reserve bank’s anti-inflation stance motivate dictum inflation inimical growth situation price stability consumer investor make inform choices. 36. it important also note order contain inflation, monetary policy seek curb demand which, turn, restrain growth. a per logic, reduction growth inevitable outcome tight monetary policy. but sacrifice short-term. in medium term, growth-inflation trade off; contrary, low stable inflation secure sustain high medium term growth. and reserve bank aim at. 37. it important note context relationship growth inflation non-linear. at low level inflation stable inflation expectations, trade-off growth inflation – inflation tolerate grease wheel growth. but certain threshold level inflation, relationship reverses, conventional trade-off disappears, high inflation actually start take toll growth. estimate reserve bank use different methodology put threshold level inflation range 4 6 per cent. inflation 6 per cent would therefore justify, indeed demand, tighten monetary policy stance. it understand inform reserve bank’s monetary policy stance. monetary policy tighten inappropriate combat supply shock drive inflation 38. a second relate criticism reserve bank’s anti-inflationary monetary policy stance india’s recent inflation drive supply shock food fuel item monetary tighten help restrain inflation case. it result avoidable sacrifice growth. 39. i several response criticism. the first inflation drive supply shock demand pressure well, evidence output expand fast potential growth rate immediate post-crisis year 2009/10 2010/11, large grow current account deficit rapid growth consumption demand. 6 bi central bankers’ speech 40. admittedly, supply shock too, addition demand pressure stoke inflation pressures. monetary policy response supply shock deliberate balance act error costly term lose growth. if judgement supply shock transitory (such cyclical increase vegetable prices), prefer policy response respond monetary tightening. if hand, judgement supply shock structural nature persist, monetary policy respond since persistent inflation, matter driver, stoke inflation expectations. monetary policy inevitably first line defence guard inflation get generalize unhinge inflation expectations. the reserve bank’s policy response guide consideration. 41. to sum up, surmise challenge pose growth-inflation dynamic following. today’s investment tomorrow’s production capacity. india need reverse investment downturn also increase significantly raise production match grow consumption demand. increase investment necessary also raise production export thereby create job home. make happen require supply response government way provide public good create conducive environment private investment. meanwhile, reserve bank ensure inflation bring threshold level maintain there. second challenge: mitigate vulnerability external sector 42. over last two years, india’s balance payment (bop) come grow pressure evidence clearly large increase current account deficit (cad). the cad last year (2011/12) 4.2 per cent gdp, historically highest; cad current year expect even higher. 43. many recall india go balance payment crisis 1991 which, fact, trigger wide range structural reform give market orientation economy. despite india’s grow integration global economy, external sector remain robust 15 year that. the current episode bop pressures, cad high peak 1991 bop crisis (3 per cent gdp) is, therefore, cause apprehension whether capacity stem pressure restore bop sustainable path. 44. the increase cad quite evidently consequence import grow fast exports. (table-2) 45. the increase import largely account oil gold imports. to understand pressure two item put bop, instructive note following. net oil gold imports, cad last year would surplus 3.8 per cent gdp contrast deficit 4.2 per cent gdp. the surge gold import explain largely erosion real return asset owe inflation. the reason oil import price inelastic due fact nearly 60 per cent petroleum product pas administer price regime; oil demand extent adjust price increases. on hand, export help even though real exchange rate depreciated, reflect fact subdue global economy, export sensitive income (i.e. global demand) price. 46. reflect current capital account bop, exchange rate depreciate nominal real term (table-3) three concern cad 47. there mainly three concern cad balance payments: (i) quantum cad; (ii) quality cad; (iii) finance cad. let briefly address these. bi central bankers’ speech 7 quantum cad 48. reserve bank’s estimate show sustainable cad india 2.5 per cent gdp. a cad sustainable level, year year, clear macroeconomic risk raise concern ability meet external payment obligation erode confidence potential lender investors. 49. an additional concern large cad even face slow growth. this perplex economic logic suggest cad improve slow economy due decline import demand. cross country evidence fact support hypothesis. such adjustment manifest india though because: (i) oil gold import relatively inelastic income changes; (ii) non-oil imports, domestic supply still unable compete imports, (iii) supply constraint subdue external demand impede exports. quality cad 50. the concern quality cad arise composition imports. if import capital goods, maybe countenance high cad investment capital good imply build production capacity tomorrow. on hand, import gold, largely hedge inflation, deadweight burden, especially time cad beyond sustainable level. finance cad 51. even cad high, able finance combination “push” “pull” factors. on push side amount surplus liquidity global system consequent upon extraordinary monetary stimulus provide advance economy central banks. on pull side measure take u attract capital flow liberalize fdi, expand limit foreign investment corporate government debt ease restriction external commercial borrow corporates. 52. in try finance large cad, expose economy risk sudden stop exit capital flows. this case extent capital flow pursuit short-term profits. should risk capital exit materialize, exchange rate become volatile cause knock-on macroeconomic disruptions. monetary ease context large cad 53. while external sector vulnerability cause concern number count i indicate above, also pose special challenge calibrate monetary policy stance. 54. in quarterly policy review end january year, reserve bank cut benchmark repo rate 25 bps response growth-inflation dynamic i outline earlier. several analyst commentator question wisdom logic monetary ease time cad rising. there two element argument: (i) interest rate cut raise aggregate demand, hence demand imports, aggravate already elevate cad; (ii) interest rate cut narrow interest differential india advance economy source capital, could potentially lead capital exit. 55. let respond strand criticism: 56. the risk cad widen stimulus offer rate cut much le apprehend host reasons. first, growth sluggish case now, rate cut unlikely translate import demand. second, rate cut response soften inflation. low inflation improve competitiveness exports. third, rate cut effect phase ease commodity price – particularly oil – reduce pressure cad. finally, empirical evidence 8 bi central bankers’ speech show emerge economy india, import demand le function low interest rate increase income. in words, marginal propensity import borrow money small. 57. on criticism impact capital flow require finance cad, must note interest rate differential one several push pull factor influence capital flows. moreover, debt equity flow traditionally respond differently rate cut. while debt flow may sensitive narrow interest rate differential, equity flow may actually increase see signal low inflation good investment environment. this experience india lead analysis this, “indian exceptionalism”. 58. the last think i want leave issue manage external sector vulnerability go day monetary policy could calibrate entirely domestic macroeconomic considerations. a india integrate rapidly world year ahead, perforce take account spillover global situation determine monetary policy stance. third challenge: manage political economy fiscal consolidation 59. the large fiscal deficit government remain one india’s big macroeconomic challenges. receive wisdom today fiscal profligacy 1980s spill external sector fuel balance payment crisis 1991. in 2011/12, combine fiscal deficit centre state government 8.1 per cent, quite close figure 9.1 per cent bop crisis year 1990/91 (chart-6). quite understandably, concern adverse macroeconomic consequence twin deficit problem – large persistent fiscal deficit along high cad. 60. there welcome, although much delayed, action correct cad fiscal deficit last six months. the government raise custom duty gold import effort restrain gold imports. more notably, recent budget firmly embrace fiscal responsibility restrain fiscal deficit next year consistent road map recommend kelkar committee. 61. in pre-crisis period, india’s fiscal consolidation largely track, consistent target adopt fiscal responsibility budget management (frbm) act, 2003. however, consolidation get interrupt crisis induce fiscal stimulus. thereafter, government adopt revise road map get fiscal consolidation back track, adhere target 2012/13. nevertheless, combine fiscal debit centre states, budget 7.2 per cent gdp 2012/13 still high. notwithstanding political economy compulsions, credible fiscal adjustment along transparent, predictable road map imperative growth macroeconomic stability. why fiscal deficit bad? 62. fiscal deficit bad number reasons. large persistent fiscal deficit threaten government’s debt sustainability. the grow interest burden eat resource available discretionary expenditure. importantly, crowd private sector debt market, inhibit private investment affect future production capacity. fiscal deficit also spill trigger balance payment pressure indeed happen india 1991. 63. by far big concern stem large fiscal deficit, especially reserve bank’s perspective, add aggregate demand thereby inflation pressures. by crowd private sector, fiscal deficit could also inhibit, impair, monetary policy transmission private sector. credible fiscal consolidation is, therefore, necessary pre-condition stabilize inflation secure non-inflationary growth. bi central bankers’ speech 9 fiscal consolidation growth 64. there concerns, admittedly marginal, fiscal consolidation sluggish growth environment dampen growth thereby adversely impact revenue push economy vicious downward spiral. there validity argument. but growth slow-down account fiscal consolidation unavoidable. growth slow-down mitigated, indeed growth aided, provide attention paid, along quantum fiscal adjustment, also quality. experience demonstrate even total expenditure proportion gdp curtailed, need dampen growth; contrary, switch current expenditure capital expenditure, fiscal consolidation actually stimulate growth “crowding in” private investment. 65. empirical estimate india validate find – even context decline total public expenditure proportion gdp, fiscal consolidation improve medium-term growth prospect government increase capital spending, offset moderate impact growth short-term. these result reflect high long-run fiscal multiplier capital expenditure low long-run multiplier current expenditure. 66. the economics fiscal consolidation quite straight forward. the complexity arise political economy. tax increase expenditure compression – two strand fiscal consolidation – never politically popular, especially democracy political executives, virtually everywhere world, characterize high discount rates. they much tempt short-term political pay off rather long-term sustainability. fiscal consolidation, definition, long-term game. in short-term political cost may exceed benefits; long-term, economic political benefit far outweigh costs. it congruence economic political virtue must inform fiscal consolidation. summing-up: india growth story intact 67. let sum up. i speak follow three macroeconomic challenge confront india i give reserve bank’s perspective them. (i) manage growth-inflation dynamic (ii) mitigate vulnerability external sector (iii) manage political economy fiscal consolidation 68. these formidable challenges, mean insurmountable. for people despair, important remember driver india growth story – get go entrepreneurism, demographic dividend, large grow middle class, opportunity productivity catch up, democracy decent legal system – intact. 69. the 12th five year plan aim growth rate 8.2 per cent plan period (2012–17). growth pace minimum necessary. indeed, india need grow even faster, sustain double digit pace, pull hundred million people poverty. the india growth story ingredient deliver promise. 70. but india growth story inevitable. it materialize absence vigorous purposeful structural governance reforms. it reform must continue engage attention. 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 13 14 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 15 bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: the way back financial integration speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, conference “international financial integration fragmentation. driver policy responses”, organize reinvent bretton wood committee bank spain, madrid, 12 march 2013. * * * i would like thank bernd schwaab, simone manganelli lorenzo cappiello contribution speech. i remain solely responsible opinion express herein. dear governor linde, lady gentlemen, i would like start thank banco de españa invite speak conference. it great pleasure madrid. in speech i would like discus reason current state fragmentation euro area way remedy situation, include completion bank union. the point i make financial integration desirable efficient allocation resource economy, assume different form also ensure stability delivered. to end, i elaborate two interrelate issues. first, i consider past current development degree financial integration euro area. the financial integration report ecb document quite clearly financial integration steadily improve financial crisis erupted. the degree financial integration decrease number market segments, although sign improvement recently. in second part speech, i discus progress financial regulation supervision also benefit financial integration europe, addition make financial system resilient. i also argue le volatile cross-border source finance, hence different quality financial integration, could avoid considerable decline degree financial integration crisis. for instance, integrate retail bank system could mitigate sudden stop cross-border fund flow crisis, could enhance risk share needed. the build block bank union could potentially reverse trend financial “de-integration” euro area also increase quality integration. i finally suggest that, addition bank funding, arm’s length finance capital market stabilise role. 1. integration vs. convergence, rationale broad financial integration europe before comment current developments, let first explain i understand financial integration, integration different mere convergence asset price yields. in eurosystem, define financial integration situation whereby friction discriminate economic agent access – investment – capital, particularly basis location. this mean financial integration achieve equal market access, de facto de jure. in set one would also expect see significant cross-border hold financial assets, along convergence asset price yield across borders. the latter follow law one price, provide asset similar cash flow affect similar risk factors. this mean that, observe differentiation yield across borders, observation, itself, sufficient evidence market fragmentation. it may mean market price different risks. similarly, different interest rate loan 2 bi central bankers’ speech smes locate different country reflect different productivities.1 conversely, well-known convergence sovereign yield across country euro area low level financial crisis not, itself, imply market integration. the bottom line convergence price necessarily mean integration; necessary sufficient condition. in discussion today, i therefore refer price-based indicator quantity-based indicator cross-border holdings. surely, economist would agree international financial integration large beneficial.2 this several reasons. first, stable, integrate adequately supervise market facilitate efficient allocation resource time across national borders, enable investor fund profitable investment opportunity whenever wherever arise. second, financial integration allow inter-temporal smooth consumption response occasional income shocks, diversification households’ financial assets, protect revenue shock labour income. this second reason special importance monetary union, stability single currency require adequate risk-sharing mechanism goods, labour capital markets. third, high degree financial integration enhance competition among financial institution well among financial market infrastructure reduce cost financial intermediation. while international financial integration beneficial, vital case euro area. a highly integrate financial system necessary ensure impulse come monetary policy diffuse homogeneously financial market across euro area whole. the financial crisis make clear, however, unchecked financial integration also pose risk financial stability. it increase financial complexity, risk cross-border contagion risk sudden stop capital flows. these risk particularly pronounce absence strong institutional framework.3 such risk illustrate internationally within euro area recent year crisis. 2. financial integration europe: salient fact figure let turn financial integration europe. overall, degree financial integration progressively increase euro area since introduction euro. however, financial crisis 2007 2010 subsequent euro area sovereign debt crisis reverse trend degree.4 for reason i give earlier, development particularly problematic eurosystem. i refer development discuss effect bank union good financial integration. let show indicators. 1 see g. moëc (2013), “the trouble smes – quick fix”, deutsche bank research note, 8 march. 2 in non-oecd countries, welfare gain international capital mobility however find much small take-off domestic productivity, see p.o. gourinchas (2006), “the elusive gain international financial integration”, review economic studies, 73(3), 715–741. 3 see fecht, f., grüner, h. p, p. hartmann (2007), “welfare effect financial integration”, cepr discussion paper no. 6311, 1–35, fecht, f., grüner, h. p., p. hartmann (2012), “financial integration, specialization, systemic risk”, journal international economics, vol. 88(1), 150–165. 4 see ecb’s financial integration report (2012). bi central bankers’ speech 3 an integrate money market important ensure balance transmission ecb’s monetary policy stance. it also market segment financial crisis first begin august 2007. the money market become increasingly impaired, especially across borders. the standard deviation euribor rate across country within euro area move consistently correspond standard deviation within domestic borders. this sign market participant demand extra premium lend counterparties locate countries. this premium rise market condition tense. during crisis, case one-month rate 12-month rates. a consequence interbank market stress, ecb step intermediation role, react non-standard monetary policy measures, fixed-rate full-allotment liquidity policy. 4 bi central bankers’ speech there similar phenomenon overnight unsecured money market secure money market. the latter usually resilient time crisis. a significant rise price differentiation repo market occur market participant increasingly take “correlation risks” account: price risk become much dependent geographic origin counterparty collateral, particular country. an additional sign risk aversion market participant shift unsecured secure market. let address cross-border lend banks. look price-based indicators, see two different phases; first, 2007, gradual convergence across country rate bank charge new loan non-financial corporations. and then, 2008 onwards, considerable reversal trend. cross-sectional variation particularly pronounce small loan €1 million. of course, high credit risk lend firm country recession explain observe cross-country variation, high rate small loan may also indication high risk agency cost monitor small projects. quantity-based indicator point relatively slow pace financial integration retail bank sector crisis. overall, outstanding cross-border loan non-financial sector euro area country increase percentage point last decade. for sure, process financial integration retail bank – though steady significant – particularly slow. on positive side, reversal trend crisis also mute market segments. the evidence point towards slow erosion early slow progress toward financial integration. bi central bankers’ speech 5 in 2010, outset sovereign debt crisis, three relatively small country strongly affected. late on, however, bond yield large country also come pressure. a stark differentiation across sovereign bond yield clearly visible chart. doe stark differentiation imply market fragmentation, market merely price different quantity risk? to answer question, help get complementary perspective quantity-based indicators. cross-border hold government bond euro area monetary financial institutions, ratio total hold securities, decline trend since 2006. the ratio return level observe begin third stage economic monetary union. the reason initial decline 2006 share government bond hold portfolio reallocation corporate bond probably international asset well. the decline late crisis likely due increase propensity bank hold domestic government bonds. this problematic, reflect increase risk link sovereign domestic bank system. we also see european investment fund hold le european debt debt crisis intensified. the renationalisation government bond hold and, generally, safe financial asset also reflect eurosystem collateral post eurosystem’s counterparties. counterparties increasingly tend post collateral home country. this create risk negative feedback loop country level, high perceive credit risk cause drop asset valuation strain fund local banks. 6 bi central bankers’ speech allow summarise discussion far. we see pronounce financial de-integration interbank market, cross-border bank activity, renationalisation bond hold crisis. all development problematic perspective eurosystem, least exhibit strong pro-cyclical feature local level euro area countries. once unleashed, financial de-integration self-reinforcing. if leave devices, saw first half bi central bankers’ speech 7 2012, de-integration lead expectation disintegration – euro break-up, ecb counteract announce outright monetary transaction (omts). there sign recede financial fragmentation since summer 2012, follow announcement omts, visible sign adjustment euro area economy government commitment strong euro area governance. this see number important market segments. the median absolute deviation spread ten-year government bond yield correspond swap spread decline one-third july 2012 february 2013. euro area bank receive cumulate €164 billion capital inflow non-euro area investor august 2012 end-january 2013, sharp contrast €21 billion cumulate outflow january july 2012. a rough measure fragmentation bank fund market across euro area, target2 balance decline €200 billion since peak mid-2012. to give one example, target2 balance banco de españa decline one-quarter since august 2012. on lend side, dispersion lend rate non-financial corporation (nfcs) also declined, considerably le dispersion monetary financial institutions’ (mfi) fund rates. for example, median absolute deviation nfc lend rate fall 5.6% first seven month 2012 4.4% since then. this provide ample evidence recede financial fragmentation. but room complacency, overall level fragmentation remain high, disconnect dispersion mfi fund lend rate reveal persistent difficulty monetary policy transmission. during financial crisis, also become painfully apparent cross-border capital flow subject sudden stops, particular interbank market. a soon counterparty risk emerged, bank become reluctant lend one another. sudden stop would materialise extreme way integration occur different market segment le sensitive information counterparty credit risk.5 in particular, cross-border retail bank relatively limit crisis, term extend credit line bank branches, term build cross-border bank-client relationships. have retail bank activity spread out, bank would find difficult suddenly withdraw fund jurisdiction stress. a consequence, would le retrenchment national jurisdictions, high degree risk share time crisis, hence less need eurosystem take intermediation role. 3. the bank union financial integration in second part speech, i would like ass invert trend financial de-integration. i argue bank union help u move towards environment good financial integration. it clear u strong independent supranational supervisor contribute significantly smooth function monetary union restore confidence bank sector. regain confidence, turn, also key reverse financial fragmentation restart fully function cross-border markets. the main objective bank union build integrate framework safeguard financial stability minimise cost bank failures. indeed, bank union, together new regulatory standards, help mitigate financial stability risk arise market become integrate previous regulatory supervisory framework fail avert period lead crisis. a complete bank union require four build blocks. 5 see, example, f. heider, m. hoerova, c. holthausen (2009), “liquidity hoard interbank market spreads: the role counterparty risk”, ecb work paper, 1126. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the first build block establishment single rulebook. such single rulebook exist agreement reach capital requirement directive iv. the single rulebook set guideline capital, liquidity compensation policies, contribute significantly create level play field financial institution across borders. second, single supervisory mechanism (ssm) enforce supervision consistently across participate member states. the ssm mechanism compose national competent authority ecb, possibility non-euro area member state also take part. the process establish ssm way, council’s proposal form basis current discussion european parliament. a third element bank union establishment single resolution mechanism (srm) single resolution authority (sra). the single resolution mechanism would build harmonise resolution framework, provide draft bank resolution recovery directive, existence single resolution fund finance industry. it would enable prompt coordinate resolution action, specifically cross-border bank concerned. for complete bank union credible fiscal backstop. any call backstop compensate ex post levy financial industry. indeed, srm bail bank public money. instead, minimise use public money. a credible backstop important respect one goal bank union project particular: mitigate negative feedback loop bank sovereigns. look ahead, fourth element bank union establishment common system deposit protection. this framework enable national deposit guarantee schemes, build common eu standards, interact srm. a european deposit guarantee undoubtedly important future ensure depositor confidence robustness european banks. i see least four main way european bank union, fully implemented, support broad stable financial integration europe. first, achieve financial stability financial market integration may possible national financial policies, least much difficult. this so-called “financial trilemma” schoenmaker (2011),6 state policy-makers choose two follow three objectives: financial stability, financial integration national financial policies, bank supervision resolution. one give way. national financial policy fail recognise externality generate cross-border bank difficulty. a result, generate under-provision supervision, capital trouble bank cross-border and/or systemic component. in addition, national supervisor may easily subject regulatory capture. both fact undermine financial stability. by set incentive correctly, fully-fledged bank union permit internalisation externality, make sure bank strengthen capital liquidity sunny day continue lend rainy days. second, single supervisory mechanism address cross-border externality typically neglect national supervisor thus contribute reverse retrenchment market fragmentation. since start sovereign crisis, country sound fundamental accumulate save rather channel fund country stress inter-bank intra-bank capital markets. during crises, supervisor act within national mandate may encourage domestic bank subsidiary abroad repatriate capital liquidity, subsidiary locate country stress. conversely, may encourage domestic subsidiary foreign bank send 6 see d. schoenmaker (2011), “the financial trilemma”, economic letters, vol. 111 (1). bi central bankers’ speech 9 fund parent bank locate country high-risk premia.7 in context strictly national supervisory system, rational behaviour, give objective national supervisory authority stability domestic financial system. that mean optimal behaviour, conducive stability euro area system whole ignore possibility adverse feedback instability elsewhere. an authority act within european mandate, however, would penalise cross-border lend way, lead le financial retrenchment renationalisation funding. third, financial crisis show sovereign credit risk health financial system closely related. in countries, weak sovereign finance feed domestic financial system, others reverse case. the introduction single supervisory mechanism single resolution mechanism help break deadly embrace. sever risk link sovereign bank system key maintain financial integration time crisis, limit pro-cyclicality counteract re-nationalisation bond holdings. fourth, large bank grow big expand across border could also incline take risk, due moral hazard ensue “too-big-to-fail” issue. the possibility resolve – may perceive credible national level, may possible supranational level within srm – would contribute contain moral hazard, hence addition decrease risk adverse loop sovereign debt bank system. together special treatment systemically important financial institution new regulatory framework, single resolution authority single resolution mechanism therefore important come contain contagion risk systemic risk naturally increase within integrate bank system. finally, development cross-border retail lend prompt bank union would reduce vulnerability sudden stop wholesale fund markets. the creation truly pan-european bank drive business decisions, encourage establishment single rulebook single supervisory mechanism, late on, common system deposit protection. it accept location bank activity within euro area determine basis efficiency arguments, industrial policy. then, then, link bank sovereign irreversibly severed. 4. the need balance finance mix my remark far address re-integration bank lend flows. while re-start integrate inter-bank intra-bank capital market clearly indispensable, significant financial intermediation occur traditional financial institutions. the role arm’s length finance, i.e. intermediation financial markets, neglected, integration respective market matters. let give two examples. first, integrate european market corporate bond may help firm raise finance bank deleveraging mode. indeed, recent evidence euro area u suggest corporate bond finance important substitute bank finance financial crisis, bank unwilling unable lend,8 substitution operate uniformly countries. the development 7 see d. gros (2012), “the single european market bank decline – ecb rescue?”, bank union europe: risk challenges, voxeu.org, 12 april 2012. 8 see f. de fiore h. uhlig (2011), “bank finance versus bond finance”, journal money, credit banking, 43(7), 1399–1421, adrian, colla, shin (2012), “which financial frictions? parse evidence financial crisis 2007–09”, nber macroeconomics annual 2012. 10 bi central bankers’ speech interconnection european corporate bond market particularly beneficial perspective. second, equity finance across borders, fdi flow equity portfolio investment, generally consider be, relatively speaking, stable source financing.9 the experience crisis cast serious doubt role debt solution moral hazard. the value equity sensitive underlie quality assets, whereas debt sensitive risk bankruptcy. equity holder balance upside downside risk equally equity therefore fairly price even environment little know risk firms,10 company risk country risk prove difficult disentangle. in addition, cross-border flow short-term debt always conducive efficient risk share great destabilise potential equity flows.11 finally, give critical need elevate growth potential, euro area country crucially need promote innovation entry new participant markets, support financial instrument venture capital.12 a integrate market equity finance would support rebalancing growth euro area economies. what i suggest europe abandon intermediate model finance complement – context structural deleveraging bank system – alternative source finance. the finance smes, heart europe’s effort increase productivity, source innovation, usefully support vibrant securitisation market. still, sme finance continue crucially rely bank lending. europe need healthy, competitive prudent bank sector. therefore, bank continue adjust balance sheet strengthen capital recreate capacity take risk lend company households, within beyond national borders. remove credit risk banks’ balance sheet, do early stage us, speed process – provide government will able take risk, individually jointly. let raise final point. a good quality financial integration would also mean provide framework cross-border capital flow go towards productive uses. this always case euro area. since introduction euro, see euro area capital flow go “healthier” (core) country “weaker” (or poorer, peripheral) countries. this superficially line economic theory would suggest: capital flow go rich poor countries, earn high return owe low level capital per worker. indeed, capital flow “downhill”, “lucas paradox” euro area global economy.13 however, many instances, capital flow go inappropriate sectors, fuel asset house price bubble instead go productive uses. it hope, least, improve financial supervision, particular supervision macro-prudential systemic focus, together 9 see hausmann, r., e. fernández-arias (2001), “foreign direct investment: good cholesterol?”, “foreign direct investment versus flow latin america”, edit de macedo, j. b., e.

bi central bankers’ speech 11 stringent enforcement macroeconomic imbalance procedure,14 help alleviate cross-border misallocations future. 5. conclusion let conclude. although still preliminary, recent sign financial re-integration across several financial market segment potential self-reinforcing unleash virtuous dynamics. the creation fully-fledged bank union set incentive good financial integration, way make euro area bank sector le vulnerable fragmentation along national border reduce pro-cyclicality euro area economies. on top conducive stable financial system, thereby conducive efficient allocation resources. for once, trade-off efficiency stability. 14 see online: european commission > economic financial affair > eu economic governance > macroeconomic imbalance procedure.

must comprehensively support asia’s long-term finance needs. let highlight two strategic area harness diverse financial ecosystem: debt capital market infrastructure financing. debt capital market in world deleveraging high regulatory constraint banks, urgent ever develop strong capital market complement bank lend help provide good match long term fund requirements. bi central bankers’ speech 5

pan-asian focus. with strong link key asian economies, singapore natural gateway international firm look access asia, asian business access world. there three new area opportunity play singapore’s pan-asian focus: asean connectivity, otc derivative infrastructure, offshore rmb business. 6 bi central bankers’ speech asean connectivity first, asean connectivity. singapore, partnership asean

go achieve seamless participation across region’s financial markets. but initiative good start. otc derivative infrastructure second, otc derivative infrastructure. earlier, i speak global regulatory reform drive revolution derivative market. this bring new market infrastructure developments, singapore make significant stride two key areas. the first area clearing. • sgx asiaclear, asia’s first otc clear facility, establish early 2006. • a counterparty buyer sellers, asiaclear mitigate counterparty credit risk otc transactions. • asiaclear’s value trade community extend record statement

position facilitate great rmb-denominated trade investment asean region. we deepen liquidity, establish key infrastructure, work industry expand range rmb product service singapore. bi central bankers’ speech 7 • in february year, industrial commercial bank china’s singapore branch designate singapore’s rmb clear bank. • just five day ago, ma people’s bank china sign enhance bilateral

heavily build competency financial sector workforce, provide train grant across broad range programme financial sector development fund (fsdf). perhaps important programme financial industry competency standard (fics), structure competency framework job-specific practice-oriented. look ahead, foster sustain strong financial sector workforce, ma take dual approach. we groom first-rate singaporean talent base, continue secure highly-skilled global professionals. ma step effort build strong core singaporean specialist leader finance. we work major financial institution here, several fronts: • nurture young singaporean entry level opportunity mentor senior leader broaden horizon across various functional roles; • give singaporean opportunity deepen specialist skill expand finance scholarship programme; • help mid-career singaporean take international post help prepare leadership positions. at time, stay relevant complex financial landscape tomorrow, singapore must remain open diverse talent expertise. the financial sector offer singaporean great opportunity well-paying, high value-added jobs. we need ensure entrant sector necessary foundational skill incumbent keep skill relevant update continuous professional development. the institute bank finance sharpen fics programme support this. conclusion let conclude. the global financial industry undergo great change. what kind financial centre want be? if i choose three words, i would say robust, trusted, purposeful • robust, sense build resilience shock manage risk prudently; • trusted, sense stay clean imbibe culture fair deal stakeholders; • purposeful, sense generate real value, create opportunity people, serve economic need singapore region. this vision cannot realise ma alone. it active partnership industry association like imas, make happen – singapore premier financial centre emerge landscape tomorrow. i wish fruitful conference. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 timothy lane: shed light shadow bank remark mr timothy lane, deputy governor bank canada, cfa society toronto, toronto, ontario, 26 june 2013. * * * introduction thank invite speak today. i would like take opportunity talk shadow banking, important area financial system reform, globally canada. shadow bank refer set activity outside formal bank system carry similar function perform banks. while term “shadow banking” tend suggest something secretive illicit, i argue that, whole, shadow bank serf useful purpose. at time, experience global financial crisis reveal shadow bank important fragilities. i talk certain common thread reform develop international level address fragility relevance canada. how shadow bank work? shadow bank comprise activity involve element maturity liquidity transformation, credit extension, risk transfer, conduct partly wholly outside “traditional” bank system. it cover wide range activities, include securitization, repos, money market fund (mmfs) well activity non-bank financial institution finance company credit hedge funds. different investor different time horizon different degree tolerance illiquidity risk. investor seek safe place park cash hold typically prefer hold asset short maturity liquid. the economy benefit existence safe asset – asset accept without constantly scrutinize issuer’s financial statements.1 at time, many productive long-term investment economy – investment essential build productive potential – inherently illiquid, long-term, risky. a result, clear role institution – either bank shadow bank – issue liability shorter-term, liquid safe hold longer-maturity, le liquid and/or risky assets. at time, role bring intrinsic risks, see bank run failure throughout history banking. such risk also illustrate implosion shadow bank activity – collapse asset-backed commercial paper run repos mmfs – global financial crisis. so establish confidence liability safe liquid? bank number feature help establish confidence. traditionally, seek build maintain reputation safety soundness, part earn profit base reputations. they typically engage broad range activities, diversify risk pursue profit opportunities. the scope activity many case make bank highly interconnect rest financial system. 1 a paper g. gorton, s. lewellen, a. metrick, “the safe-asset share,” american economic review 102 (3)(2012): 101–106, discus economic role safe asset – characterize asset “informationally insensitive” – show stable share total asset long historical period. 2 bi central bankers’ speech bank also maintain confidence capital liability structure. the capital invest shareholder available absorb losses. they hold liquid asset redeem deposit demand. at time, since bank highly leveraged, strong incentive manage risk exposed, notably credit risk, include collect information borrower monitor behaviour. strong bank long synonymous high capitalization levels, conservative balance-sheet structures, robust risk-management lend standards. despite traditional features, bank still subject run failures, carry enormous cost economy. from great depression great recession, instance bank failure lead public policy initiative make bank safer. central bank provide liquidity bank solvent run short liquid assets. deposit insurance reduce incentive depositor run bank time stress. these element “safety net” complement stringent regulation – require bank enough capital absorb loss enough liquid asset meet plausible potential drains. in addition, bank supervisor scrutinize many aspect operations. regulation supervision essential maintain depositor confidence ensure bank rely excessively safety net – thus limit moral hazard. so shadow banking? confidence shadow bank partly base collateral. for example, investor hold asset-backed security mainly strength underlie assets, rather reputation issuer – may anonymous special purpose vehicle create sole purpose hold asset issue securities. similarly, investor provide cash repo transaction because, even institution receive cash default, institution provide cash would claim underlie asset. in cases, shadow bank asset perceive safe narrow range activity engage. for example, mmfs provide close substitute bank deposits, partly invest liquid, short-term, low-risk securities. other shadow bank institutions, credit hedge fund finance companies, structure asset liability various way avoid subject runs. thus, shadow bank variety business model maintain investors’ confidence obtain access financing. these model different regular banks, one another. so advantage shadow banking, give bank already exist? for form intermediation, shadow bank may efficient provide healthy competition traditional banks. room banks’ balance sheet expensive, avoid use balance sheet save money free lend capacity. the regulation bank subject may also give le flexibility serve sector market, least restrict ability offer customer competitive package. where bank tread, shadow bank step fill gap make financial system efficient. a financial system diverse set business model may innovative resilient. and, give bank often highly interconnected, may advantage, interest financial stability, transfer risk outside bank system. in particular, use market mechanism distribute diversify risk, end bear investor will hold risk. at time, shadow bank form regulatory arbitrage, circumvent regulation bank subject. such behaviour create distortion additional risk system. a bank regulation tightened, incentive behaviour obviously increase. bi central bankers’ speech 3 while bank shadow bank separate function activities, important remember path intersect. shadow bank rely traditional banks. many form shadow banking, asset-backed commercial paper relate structure products, often require support bank liquidity line bring market. and bank turn rely shadow bank funding, example, repo residential mortgage back security cover bonds. what go wrong? the weakness traditional bank shadow bank clearly expose global financial crisis: prove vulnerable run-like behaviour despite feature intend bolster confidence. a number core fund market freeze financial institution lose confidence lend one another. the flight counterparty risk reflect vulnerability many banks, well fragility shadow bank system. i won’t dwell vulnerability bank addressed, since discuss considerable detail elsewhere, i discus weakness expose global shadow banking. during crisis, repo market come severe stress. market maker cash lender become le able will provide repo financing, and, result, repo borrower experience difficulty finance even good-quality collateral. borrow limit reduced, term transaction shortened, haircut private security accept collateral widen range security accept collateral narrow safest. the volume repo transaction drop sharply. such strain experience canada around world. market various asset-backed security collapsed. in unite states, market mortgage-backed security various structure product essentially closed: issuance stopped, price fell sharply, perception securities’ safety badly damaged. canada experience crisis non-bank asset-backed commercial paper mid-2007; coordinate action public private sector prevent potentially catastrophic system-wide repercussions. money market fund unite state experience substantial drains, fear emerge fund would “break buck.” the federal reserve introduce extraordinary liquidity facility unite state government provide temporary guarantee halt full-fledged run. these development similar traditional bank run – general withdrawal participation certain market fear counterparty risk. they also expose risk associate use collateral become difficult value dispose illiquid markets. we saw system come stress, market participant face prospect unload collateral fire-sale price – many case expose institution “wrong-way” risk inadequately prepared.2 for similar reasons, margin derivative transaction haircut collateral increased. these stress shadow bank system amplify stress financial system generally transmit globally. another underlie issue surface misalignment incentives. here, strike example case mortgage-backed securities, structure product “originate distribute” model. since investor could readily ass quality asset back 2 “wrong-way” risk refer risk value collateral likely decline circumstance counterparty likely default. (in words, collateral turn insufficient precisely need most). 4 bi central bankers’ speech securities, incentive originator use, over-issue, lower-quality assets, know would earn origination fees, investor would bear risk. moreover, complexity structure product obscure high level leverage, exacerbate loss underlie asset value declined.3 the linkage traditional bank shadow bank mean vulnerability spread. for example, asset-backed security come pressure, sponsor bank face significant drain credit liquidity line provided. in cases, end stand behind asset-backed security sponsored, largely maintain reputations, despite legal obligation so. at time, since shadow bank become important source fund bank themselves, stress shadow bank impact banks: example, repo market seize up, bank face severe fund pressures. how fix it? the experience crisis point need reform enable shadow bank continue play useful role address inherent risks. the purpose stamp risk, ensure risk appropriately understand managed. a relate purpose prevent increase shadow bank activity drive solely regulatory arbitrage response tighten regulation face banks. the financial stability board (fsb) map international work shadow banking, identify five work streams: link bank shadow banking; money market funds; shadow bank organizations; securitization; security lend repos. the fsb also begin monitor evolution sector associate risks. to guide key reforms, fsb establish basic principles. the regulatory measure be: • focused, target risk shadow bank creates; • proportionate risk financial system; • forward look adaptable emerge risk innovations; • effective, balance need international consistency well jurisdictional differences; and, finally, • regularly assess review follow implementation, improve necessary. i would like stress common thread run global reform agenda: reduce susceptibility run liquidity freeze good align incentives. let talk apply three shadow bank activities: repo markets, securitization mmfs. with repo markets, key element reduce vulnerability kind concern counterparty risk surface crisis. one important aspect reform discussion relate market participant set haircut – amount collateral require – repo transactions. the focus haircut question perception versus 3 in unite states, pre-crisis period, securitization disperse risk extent believed. in fact, amplify exposure many institution common shock link u.s. house mortgage market may increase interconnectedness within financial system. the widespread use credit rat structure mortgage product give investor mislead sense security rat primarily base idiosyncratic risk mortgage securitization pool, rather systemic risk collapse u.s. house market. the financial stability board since introduce principle reduce reliance rat credit-rating agencies. bi central bankers’ speech 5 reality. it recognize market condition good, low volatility low perceive level risk, haircut charge market participant fall level might consider prudent risk-management perspective. this result competitive pressure among financial institution haircut methodology place weight recent benign market movements. decline haircut level increase ability market participant obtain leverage, turn fuel increase asset prices. when shock hits, cycle quickly reverse asset price fall, volatility spikes, haircut raise margin call ensue.4 in light possibility, serious consideration give enforce minimum quality standard methodology market participant use set collateral haircut repos. this could include impose minimum numerical haircut certain type risky transactions.5 now let turn securitization. here, one priority align incentive institution originate loan investors. proposal focus need ensure originator “skin game,” require retain certain minimum share security sell, enhance transparency regard underlie assets. proposal reform mmfs focus reduce vulnerability run-like behaviour. like bank deposits, mmf traditionally promise redeem share par, is, constant net asset value. the mmf investor may thus incentive run case asset may insufficient back claim – instance, concern fund may suffer serious credit loss assets. various proposal address weakness table: move variable net asset value; require cushion capital impose tight requirement liquidity asset hold mmf; establish “gates” – i.e., restriction investors’ ability withdraw money short notice; combination measures. the goal make mmfs le vulnerable run without end usefulness close substitute bank deposit important source short-term fund number private public sector borrowers. what mean canada? so far, i’ve talk shadow bank issue mainly international perspective. now i would like focus issue apply home. in canada, shadow bank limit scale scope jurisdictions, especially unite states, competitive pressure regulatory restriction drive activity bank system. let’s look numbers. shadow bank canada represent 40 per cent activity traditional bank sector, average 50 per cent decade 2008. a share gdp, canadian shadow bank roughly 40 per cent, compare 95 per cent unite states.6 4 committee global financial system, 2010, “the role margin requirement haircut procyclicality,” cgfs publication no. 36. 5 financial stability board, 2012, “securities lend repos: market overview financial stability issues,” interim report fsb workstream security lend repos, 27 april. 6 see, t. gravelle, t. grieder s. lavoie, “monitoring assess risk canada’s shadow bank sector,” bank canada financial system review (june 2013): 55–63.this measure shadow bank activities, undertake bank regulate financial institutions. this contrast entity-based measure report fsb, comprise asset institution outside perimeter prudential regulation. accord fsb definition, asset shadow bank entity 6 bi central bankers’ speech the composition shadow bank also different canada elsewhere. one key element repo markets, important fund market canadian financial institutions. although repo market base primarily government security involve little credit risk, case least one counterparties regulate financial institution, crisis experience kind freeze occur countries. this experience motivate move toward central clear repos use canadian derivative clear service, go live last year.7 a important element shadow bank canada securitization government-guaranteed mortgages, essentially convert illiquid asset – mortgage – liquid, securitized debt instruments. this form securitization double past five years.8 when mortgage lend fund issue debt security back insure mortgages, move mortgage lend away traditional on-balance-sheet model whereby mortgage fund branch-sourced, retail deposits. this represent relatively low-cost form term fund financial institutions. here, key concern potential misallocation resource away non-mortgage lend toward mortgage credit – which, current economic environment, contribute buildup imbalance household sector.9 another aspect securitization insure mortgage increase role specialize mortgage-lending institutions. these institution subject level scrutiny bank instance don’t access stable diversify source funding. while small size suggest pose systemic risk, involve element shadow bank risk call careful monitoring. money-market fund make fairly small segment shadow bank canada. at end 2012, canadian mmfs approximately $30 billion asset management, le half peak level reach 2009. despite small size, risk run pose mmfs still exist must manage carefully. come shadow recognize benefit risk shadow bank sector, need continue work make safer. internationally, work partner fsb develop integrate set recommendation present g-20 meet st. petersburg september. the canadian authority need decide implement reform agree global level. some measure could consider include: • establish consistent standard haircut set repo transactions, include numerical minimum haircut type transactions; • require originate securitized product enough skin game align incentive good investors; canada 28 percent gdp 2011. the measure traditional bank liability consist gross deposit (including longer-term canadian-dollar unsecured debt), subordinate debt foreign currency deposit canadian residents. 7 a. côté. 2013. “toward strong financial market infrastructure canada: take stock.” (speech association financial professional canada (montréal chapter), montréal, quebec, 26 march). 8 the value securitized mortgage grow $160 billion 2007 $386 billion end-2012. 9 the bank canada’s june 2013 financial system review provide update assessment system-wide risk associate household sector imbalances. bi central bankers’ speech 7 • make money market fund le vulnerable runs, appropriate combination capital liquidity requirements, restriction withdrawals; • establish clear consistent framework regulate shadow bank institutions; • limit banks’ exposure shadow bank activity; • provide right degree transparency around many aspect shadow banking, market discipline work better. conclusion a i stressed, shadow bank deliver important benefit economy. there need liquidity maturity transformation, credit extension risk transfer provides. in deliver services, healthy alternative traditional bank system provide competition, diversity innovation. at time, reform need make shadow bank safer. shadow bank make le susceptible run-like behaviour contagion. align incentive – transparency appropriate regulation – also essential. canada stake reforms, beneficiary resilient global financial system shadow bank activity could make robust. since innovation one key benefit shadow banking, innovation also fact life regulate sector. shadow bank know reinvent continue response regulation. we need develop adopt principle broad-based enough encompass new activities. risk inherent global financial system. we can’t stamp out, would want to. rather, goal create incentive risk allocate manage appropriately, bank shadow bank activities, make entire financial system strong resilient. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jerome h powell: think unconventional monetary policy speech mr jerome h powell, member board governor federal reserve system, bipartisan policy center, washington dc, 27 june 2013. * * * view express speech mine may represent fomc members. i would like thank member board staff, include jam clouse, dan covitz, jon faust, john maggs, raven molloy, karen pence, jeremy rudd, brad strum. it great back bipartisan policy center. i comment briefly outlook economy turn monetary policy. near-term outlook our economy grow average annual rate 2 percent since recovery begin exactly four year ago. that modest pace notably weak experience past recovery would predicted, even account depth duration great recession.1 since 2009, question recovery decisively take hold begin deliver high level growth need put people back work quickly. against background, federal open market committee (fomc) meet last week, and, among tasks, 19 member committee submit individual economic projection growth, unemployment, inflation 2013 2015. these forecast combine summary economic projection (sep), high-level outline release chairman’s press conference last week. fomc participant generally expect acceleration recovery 2013 2014 continue strong growth 2015. while i make claim special forecast skills, individual projection within so-called central tendency projections. of course, economy look poise breakout several time since 2009, disappoint. will time different? there are, view, good reason believe economy continue gain strength. i would point particular house sector, prior recovery important engine growth. for first two year current recovery, house contribute nothing growth, house investment hover extremely low levels. house price decline sharply 2011, wipe half home equity restrain consumer spending. but house market finally begin recover early 2012, recovery seem proceed strongly. single-family house start rise 40 percent past two years, albeit low base. house price 10 percent past 12 months. a good house market help boost consumer attitude low level support consumer spending. the house sector still hold back limit credit availability less-creditworthy homebuyers tight condition homebuilders. but overall trend suggest house recovery continue many year become important contributor growth. 1 see greg howard, robert martin, beth anne wilson (2011), “are recovery bank financial crisis really so different?“ international finance discussion paper 1037 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, march); janet l. yellen (2013), “a painfully slow recovery america’s workers: causes, implications, federal reserve’s response,“ speech deliver “a trans-atlantic agenda share prosperity,” conference sponsor afl-cio, friedrich ebert stiftung, imk macroeconomic policy institute, hold washington, february 11. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the labor market also make real progress, i discus moment. auto sale nearly return pre-recession levels. our financial system far healthy good capitalize crisis. and lose one-half value financial crisis, stock market exceed pre-recession peak nominal terms. growth would high year u.s. fiscal policy. the congressional budget office (cbo) estimate federal tax increase spend cut slow pace real gross domestic product (gdp) growth 1–1/2 percentage point year.2 tight fiscal policy may also prevent fast reduction unemployment. i surprise well consumer spend – private domestic final demand generally – hold face pronounce fiscal drag. in first quarter year, consumer spend private domestic final demand rise annual rate 2–1/2 percent. more-recent indicator household business spend suggest private demand continue advance reasonable clip despite fiscal tightening. this strength reason optimism. indeed, even real gdp rise 2 percent year—which bottom end range projection june sep—it would still represent solid performance face fiscal headwinds. there still long way go achieve full recovery. the heal process take time, continue make real progress. let’s turn monetary policy, start dual mandate, pursuant congress direct federal reserve conduct monetary policy foster stable price full employment. dual mandate – inflation inflation currently run fomc’s 2 percent long-term objective personal consumption expenditure (pce) price inflation, read attention. but inflation often fluctuate transitory reasons. we generally try look transitory movements, whether objective. there reason think recent low read partly reflect transitory factors. other factor point gradual increase inflation. while measure longer-term inflation expectation move down, others remain stable. most fomc participant anticipate inflation gradually move fomc’s 2 percent target come years. continue low fall inflation could, however, raise real concerns. inflation low well high. i doubt committee monitor carefully defend inflation goal “from below,” necessary. dual mandate – full employment the employment side dual mandate different story. from payroll employment’s peak january 2008 trough february 2010, u.s. economy lose nearly 9 million jobs, unemployment rate rise average 4–1/2 percent 2007 high 10 percent october 2009. a economy recovered, regain three-fourths lose jobs. unemployment 7.6 percent may come 2–1/2 percentage point peak. a broad measure include find part-time work, well want job stop looking, 13.8 percent last month; 2007, measure average 8–1/4 percent. in addition, long-term unemployment remain high – 4.4 million american 37 percent unemployed work six month more. these number 2 congressional budget office (2013), the budget economic outlook: fiscal year 2013 2023 (washington: cbo, february). bi central bankers’ speech 3 represent tragedy hardship worker families, course, also represent crucial economic challenge. the long worker unemployed, great likelihood skill erode worker lose attachment labor force, permanently damage economy’s dynamism potential output. to summarize, although inflation target, expect observer return time committee’s 2 percent objective. the committee continue carefully monitor inflation developments. but still far full employment. the case continue support economy monetary policy strong. implication monetary policy the federal fund rate near zero since late 2008, since fomc provide accommodation two relatively new policy tools. these tool “forward guidance” future level federal fund rate, interest rate charge overnight loan banks, large-scale asset purchase program (“asset purchases,” lsaps). in part, forward-guidance tool embody threshold fomc adopt last december. the committee indicate intention hold short-term rate near zero least long unemployment remain 6.5 percent, provide inflation one- two-years ahead project high 2.5 percent.4 3and current flow-based lsap program, adopt last year, purchase $85 billion month long-term treasury security agency mortgage-backed security (mbs). although level purchase may vary depend economic conditions, program continue substantial improvement outlook labor market, context price stability. i see first tool, forward guidance rates, really extension traditional central bank rate-setting policy. by state intention hold rate low link intention path economy, forward guidance affect path longer-term rate allow market make adjustment rate economic condition evolve. the second tool large-scale asset purchases. by purchase hold large amount treasury security mbs, put additional downward pressure term premium long-term rates. asset purchase innovative, unconventional policy. their likely benefit may accompany cost risks, nature size remain uncertain. these two policy complementary play somewhat different roles. asset purchase deploy add near-term momentum economy. after purchase eventually completed, purchase asset remain fed’s balance sheet time continue put downward pressure rates. the committee continue use interest rate policy, include forward guidance short-term rates, return full employment. provide inflation remain check, committee begin ass whether increase short-term rate unemployment reach 6.5 percent. two important consideration likely arise time. first, inflation remain low, expected, would signal still significant slack economy. second, variety information shed light health labor market, include labor force participation rate, flow employment, measure labor slack. after committee first raise short-term rates, take balanced, likelihood gradual, approach consistent longer-run goal full employment inflation 2 percent. 3 the committee’s long-run objective pce inflation remain 2 percent. see board governor federal reserve system (2013), “fomc longer-run goal monetary policy strategy (pdf),” statement, january 29. 4 bi central bankers’ speech both forward guidance asset purchase work low longer-term interest rate contribute ease overall financial market conditions. low rate increase economic activity variety channels.4 business household react low rate invest spend more. low rate also support price house financial asset stock bonds. high asset price increase wealth and, lag, induce high spending. in likelihood, current lsap program continue time. it therefore appropriate ask well asset purchase worked, whether still work today. benefit most research found, i agree, first round purchase longer-term securities, begin november 2008, contribute significantly end financial crisis prevent much severe economic contraction. the second round purchase begin november 2010 also appear successful counter disinflationary pressures.5 now financial crisis recede economy recover moderate pace, asset purchase still effective? in view, evidence across channel mixed, positive balance. economic model use provide necessarily uncertain estimate effect economy fomc’s asset purchases. the fed’s workhorse macro model frb/us, estimate reduction 20 basis point unemployment rate three year wake $500 billion purchase longer-term securities. there reason think estimate may low; example, frb/us include direct channel lsaps boost house prices. there also reason think estimate might high, since channel low rate spur economic activity could attenuate current circumstances, example, low credit availability small business le creditworthy households, corporate household risk aversion. my view lsaps continue provide meaningful support economic activity perhaps le frb/us estimate suggest. although channel may work perfectly, unlikely work all. beyond model-predicted effects, also seem likely economy continue benefit knowledge federal reserve commit support growth long necessary. 4 see

concern policy might drive excessive risk-taking create bubble financial asset housing. a relate worry eventual process reduce purchase normalize balance sheet may destabilize disruptive economy. indeed, recent volatility market part relate concern possibility reduction asset purchases. i’ll address broad concerns, start incentive risk-taking. monetary policy help keep real interest rate low. while longer-term real rate turn positive recent weeks, remain historically low levels. experience suggest low real rates, maintain long time, lead asset price bubble eventually financial instability. but low rate solely even primarily result federal reserve’s accommodative monetary policies; root market’s expectation low inflation weakness economic recovery, factor weigh rate unite state throughout advance economies.6 give low real rate low inflation, expect nominal return low across asset classes. the concern would conditions, policies, could encourage irrational expectation high returns. be sign now? by measures, equity valuation seem within normal range. whether one look trail forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, option prices, little basis argue market show excessive optimism future returns. of course, equity market always downside risk. but, board colleague jeremy stein observed, sign “reach yield” fixed-income market time.7 demand higher-yielding fixed-income security outstrip new supply. the result low rates, decline spreads, increase leverage, pressure non-price term covenants. these concern diminish somewhat rate rise since mid-may. nonetheless, since likely asset purchase continue time, market need careful monitoring. what house prices? at peak bubble, house price 40 percent usual relationship rents, accord one model feed staff follows. at trough, house price fall 10 percent fair valuation. give price increase past year, – light one model – move back approximate neighborhood fair valuation. the second concern process normalize monetary policy balance sheet could destabilize disruptive economy. many cite experience 1994 2003, long-term rate increase quite sharply change view likely near-term path policy. in instances, change view economy change public’s understand federal reserve’s policy intentions. these two factor affect market recent weeks. 6 see ben s. bernanke (2013), “long-term interest rates,” speech deliver “the past future monetary policy,” conference sponsor federal reserve bank san francisco, hold san francisco, march 1. 7 see jeremy c. stein (2013), “overheating credit markets: origins, measurement, policy responses,” speech deliver “restoring household financial stability great recession: why household balance sheet matter,” research symposium sponsor federal reserve bank st. louis, hold st. louis, mo., february 5–7. 6 bi central bankers’ speech market adjustment since may large would justify reasonable reassessment path policy. in particular, reaction forward future market short-term rate appear keep assessment committee’s intentions, give forecasts. the june sep show 15 19 participant see first rate increase happen 2015 2016. the path rate ultimately depend path economy, committee say first rate increase happen considerable time elapse asset purchase concluded. thus, extent market price increase federal fund rate 2014, imply strong economic performance forecast either fomc participant private forecasters. we make significant stride communication recent years. the unemployment inflation threshold i discuss earlier, well communication around asset purchases, design improve public understand committee’s intentions. but communication bind imperfect, change outlook still lead adjustment asset prices. thus, volatility unavoidable, indeed necessary part process market economy adjust incoming information. the path ahead monetary policy last week, chairman provide great clarity path asset purchases. specifically, chairman note that, incoming data broadly consistent committee’s sense economic outlook, committee currently anticipate would appropriate moderate monthly pace purchase late year. if subsequent data remain broadly align committee’s current expectation economy, committee could continue reduce pace purchase measure step first half next year, end purchase around mid-year. at time, unemployment rate would likely vicinity 7 percent, growth consistent improvement inflation head back toward objective. if unemployment reach 7 percent range, would constitute substantial improvement 8.1 percent unemployment rate prevail committee announce current program asset purchases. i want emphasize importance data date. if committee’s economic outlook broadly realized, likely moderation pace purchase late year. if performance economy weaker, committee may delay moderate purchase even increase them. if economy strengthen fast committee anticipates, pace purchase may moderate somewhat quickly. the path purchase way predetermined; monitor economic data adjust purchase appropriate. in view, real progress labor market. the committee first adopt “substantial improvement” test september 2012 meeting, appropriate measure economy’s progress economic condition time. when committee meet september, unemployment rate stand 8.1 percent. today, nine month later, unemployment rate 7.6 percent – large decline fomc participant expect september. at time september meeting, nonfarm payroll report increase monthly rate 97,000 prior six months.8 today trail six-month average payroll growth 194,000. other labor market indicator also show moderate progress, include aggregate hour worked, initial unemployment insurance claims, duration unemployment, share long-term unemployment. 8 the level payroll employment would subsequently revise up, committee didn’t know september 2012 meet revision would occur. bi central bankers’ speech 7 conclusion there many sign economy healing. if committee’s economic outlook broadly realized, see first moderation pace purchase late year, would good news. the first reduction purchases, comes, acknowledgement economy’s progress sign committee’s confidence path full recovery. in cases, path policy remain fully data-dependent. if economic growth, unemployment, inflation meet committee’s expectations, financial condition evolve way inconsistent continue recovery, committee respond. thanks, i happy take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter pang: strategy development islamic capital market welcome remark mr peter pang, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, ifsb

policy – context thailand speech dr prasarn trairatvorakul, governor bank thailand, foreign correspondents’ club thailand (fcct), bangkok, 17 june 2013. * * * good even lady gentlemen, i would like thank foreign correspondents’ club thailand invitation. it honor pleasure back share view thailand’s economic outlook monetary policy. we indeed live volatile uncertain world. just month ago still talk two- three-speed global economy fact life, robust growth expect emerge market sluggish recovery remain major economies. today, possibility earlier-than-expected taper qe, coincide apparent slowdown many emerge market economies, convergence world economy already expect some. one obvious consequence market overreaction premature sign convergence. the unsettle sentiment potential end cheap money may contribute sizeable outflow capital emerge market past weeks. a consequence, emerge market currency include thai baht depreciate sharply, reverse gain since begin year. one lesson recent episode that, expectation go long way influence people’s behavior, often implication policymakers. specifically, remind u powerful expectation channel monetary policy transmission be. it therefore utmost importance central bank properly manage expectation maximize monetary policy effectiveness maintain policy credibility. this draw focus talk evening: limit monetary policy, namely, monetary policy cannot do. give unprecedented economic headwind various sources, monetary policy around world immense demand. but expectations, unrealistic met, could damage central bank credibility, end diminish central banks’ influence, unnecessary cost economy. thus, important central bank establish realistic public expectation policy. but i turn topic, let first review current economic conditions, outlook thai economy, recent monetary policy response. recent economic development monetary policy response despite robust economic growth last year, thai economy start year moderation. growth first quarter 5.3 percent compare period last year low expected. part slowdown may natural reversion normal pace growth strong post-flood acceleration. but alone may explain whole story. evidently, recent slowdown private consumption also owe part low farm income high household debt may hold back consumers’ willingness spend. meanwhile, uncertainty global demand may pull back private investment especially export-oriented sector. on external front, despite incipient sign gradual improvement u japanese economy, disappoint chinese asian economic performance likely put drag overall thailand’s trade partners’ growth hence continue weigh thai exports. look ahead, however, medium-term trajectory economy remain intact back solid economic fundamentals, include high level employment, rise income robust private sector confidence. fiscal policy continue lend support 2 bi central bankers’ speech economy especially large-scale infrastructure investment expect phase latter part year. this would potentially generate favorable crowding-in effect private spending. a price financial stability, inflation ease due low oil commodity prices, line subdue global inflationary pressure. look ahead, however, cost pass-through price expect increase domestic demand pick up. at time, risk financial stability remain ongoing concern particular attention give household debt sector real estate market. in light recent developments, mpc judge downside risk growth increase domestic demand slowdown somewhat slower-than-expected global recovery. although view medium-term outlook thai economy changed, balance risk seem tilt towards growth rather inflation. the mpc therefore decide cut policy rate provide insurance economy face great downside risk growth. with firmly anchor inflation expectations, bank thailand today give weight stabilize economic development set interest rate. however, outlook inflation, growth, financial stability change future period, room maneuver counteract development monetary policy, well policy tool appropriate mix deem suitable achieve overall macroeconomic stability. limitation monetary policy let turn topic i would like highlight today, is, limit monetary policy achieve. the global financial crisis place far great demand monetary policy around world. in major economy macroeconomic policy tool impaired, monetary policy enormous pressure support economy. central bank respond expand dramatically traditional role lender last resort come innovative, unconventional way stretch beyond monetary policy normally do. in emerge markets, give large crisis repercussion term excessive capital flows, monetary policy time expect respond external development deal global spillovers. overall, monetary policy push situation action previously unimaginable. effort many central bank overstretch normal capacity may lead public expect much monetary policy. there danger associate conviction, widen gap expect central bank realistically deliver end undermine central bank credibility. to maintain public trust central banks, important clearly lay monetary policy cannot achieve. i would like highlight three area monetary policy limit thailand particularly bind present. understand limit would also help explain monetary policy actions. 1. single instrument, multiple objective the first limitation fact multiple objective cannot target use one instrument, namely, policy interest rate. this key reason central bank world today typically focus single primary objective price stability, crucial well-functioning market economy monetary policy control over. there course equally important policy objectives, particular financial stability, recent global crisis clearly illustrated. the “flexible inflation targeting” precisely design allow central bank stabilize inflation also mitigate risk build-up financial imbalances. endow central bank policy tool achieve additional objective gather lot support international policy forums. the demand monetary policy stop there, however. it also suggest bi central bankers’ speech 3 monetary policy respond directly capital flow exchange rate example. can single policy interest rate target objective simultaneously? of course, fortunate coincidence objective conflict, dilemma. more often not, however, policy choice involve trade-off different objectives. policymakers weigh carefully cost benefit policy decision. give multiple macroeconomic objectives, need supplementary tool truly minimize cost tradeoffs. a first example, policy instrument employ address risk external stability? in many emerge market economies, one often find problem exchange rate dominance, namely risk exchange rate consideration dominate conduct monetary policy distract central bank main goal price stability. the simple way address problem would allow exchange rate flexibility first line defense. of course, rule intervention limit excessive exchange rate volatility. that next line defense. should situation warrant, type capital flow management measure deploy exceptional circumstance sustain substantial exchange rate overvaluation. however, give distortive effect collateral damage bring upon economy, introduction type measure carefully design minimize unintended consequences, especially productive long-term capital inflow highly value. a case prevent financial imbalances, sometimes propose policy rate sufficient traction address risk financial stability, adjustment may need large significant adverse impact economic activity, price dear pay. thus, additional objective manage credit growth asset price order avoid financial instability, one really need another instrument act directly source problem. that “macro-prudential policy” suppose achieve. 2. imperfect foresight the second limitation monetary policy lie notion policymakers limit capacity measure economic performance precisely even real time, mention forecast future. monetary policy always conduct uncertain environment. unforeseen macroeconomic shocks, imprecisely estimate effect policy macroeconomic variables, noisy measurement render monetary policy design implementation challenge task. our state knowledge also far perfect understand people’s decision make determine future evolution economy. the task even daunt world go significant transformation, unprecedented policy action across globe, yet-to-be- know consequence action unwinding. face uncertainty complexity environment operate in, need take broad perspective make sure decision robust different plausible eventualities. at time, bank thailand constantly strive expand economic surveillance capability, collect up-to-date intelligence economic financial condition indirect direct contact market. the insight direct contact, couple information survey like business sentiment survey sharpen picture get available statistics. this one reason monetary policy cannot simply follow mechanistic simplistic rule base solely single data. nonetheless, uncertainty never table. in light, prudent approach move careful measure steps. that kind incremental action perceive right direction likely contribute economic stability aggressive attempt fine tune economy. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 3. inability address supply-side impediment the third limitation monetary policy i would like emphasize today inability address supply-side impediments. through interest rate adjustment, monetary policy influence aggregate demand economy. but monetary policy cannot solve deep structural problem lift growth potential economy. that need come real progress increase productivity relax supply-side constraints. sure, demand stimulate buy time cushion economy short-term economic shocks. but may possibly delay necessary adjustment economy longer-term challenges. for example, keep interest rate low long keep exchange rate undervalued, beside encourage risk take store financial instability problem future, may also temper incentive business improve efficiencies, may slow reallocation capital labor productive uses. in context thailand, one important structural issue face thai economy moment labor shortage. through business contact recent surveys, labor shortage score one top concern domestic foreign business operate thailand. underlie cause labor shortage include demographic change education skill mismatch. clearly, little monetary policy solve supply bottleneck. it help foster macroeconomic stability conducive business investment, effort address supply-side impediment still need come broad balance set economic policy include fiscal, industrial, technology, labor market policies. conclude remark let end talk today say that, central banker, ambitious make best use available policy tool improve understand economy well shock drive it. but set ambition high capability monetary policy would likely prove counter-productive. it old establish wisdom monetary policy best deliver price stability. while learn great deal aspect macroeconomic stability, little disagreement price stability must remain central objective monetary policy long run. abandon objective risk de-anchoring price expectation induce unnecessary economic volatility. the deployment supplementary tool go way help relax limitation, monetary policy panacea. lady gentlemen, only understand power limit monetary policy, economy able reap benefit policy lever. the bank thailand continue utmost strive overall macroeconomic stability, long-term prosperity thailand. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 zeti akhtar aziz: regulatory governance islamic finance speech

strengthen prospect future growth stability. asia global economy the global economic landscape significantly evolve progress towards new multi-polar world. this shape increase contribution emerge economy global economic growth, vibrant dynamic emerge economy asian region. in 2012, asian region contribute 56% global growth. this advancement take place time world economy continue significantly challenge linger effect 2008 global financial crisis, sustainable economic recovery yet secured. asia’s growth trajectory underpin several favorable fundamentals, continue support prospect growth go forward. asia highly diverse region term economic demographic structure, market size, stage development, political systems. this provide immense opportunity region leverage complementarity boost

towards urbanization infrastructure development region. the asian development bank estimate asia need invest total usd8 trillion fund infrastructure development rail networks, airports, power network water treatment plant current decade 2020. these investments, reinforce grow consumer market, become important driver private investment activity. this trend also well support grow resilient financial system region. intra-regional trade activity also rapidly increasing, signify deepen economic tie within region. intra-regional trade east asia expand average 44% total trade 1995, 50% 2010. similarly, intra-regional investment activity rise trend. more recent effort focus strengthen regional financial integration aim promote efficient intermediation fund asia. the strengthen domestic

islamic financial service industry – key area capital adequacy, risk management, corporate governance shariah governance. their implementation would turn promote consistent regulatory supervisory

toolkit ensure financial system stability, recent global crisis highlight need complement macroprudential surveillance measures. this dimension prudential regulation involve incorporation horizontal assessment risk across institutions, sector national borders, include risk asset markets. this address systemic risk take account interconnectedness within financial system. this particularly relevant islamic financial service industry give close link islamic finance real economic sector various mode islamic finance contracts. in particular, heighten surveillance need development real estate

financial supervisor conference, copenhagen, 25 june 2013. * * * thank much invite today conference copenhagen. it pleasure speak extremely timely topic like bank union. a know, finance minister reach political compromise bank recovery resolution directive yet friday/saturday. we hear positive news bank recovery resolution directive (brrd), important milestone road towards bank union. moreover, wait also final vote single supervisory mechanism european parliament early july. i hope timetable hold proceed well preparation kick-off single supervisory system 2014. why bank union? let start question necessary establish bank union single supervisory mechanism (ssm) key component? the crisis since 2008 make clear highly interconnect integrate euro area require strong institutional framework currently have. a problem one bank quickly spread bank home beyond national border devastate effect real economy taxpayers. furthermore, crisis lead sudden stop capital flow within europe, bank withdraw within national border financial integration take serious setbacks. an important element strengthen financial institutional framework creation bank union. the agreement establish ssm reach record pace. a strong independent supranational supervisor need ensure smooth function monetary union restore confidence bank sector. the key element confidence rebuild balance sheet assessment bank conduct ssm run timely action, necessary, potential weakness banks’ balance sheets. the idea legacy asset problem detect potential capital shortage correct operational start ssm shift supervisory responsibility european central bank (ecb). credibility national supervision suffer three reasons. first, national mandate supervisor lead inability handle cross-border challenges. second, call regulatory capture i.e. close relationship bank supervisor lead instance slow reaction unwillingness react notice problem banks. third, suspicion political influence supervision weaken stand credibility supervisors. moreover, 2010 become desperately evident bank sovereign risk tightly interconnect two-way causality. the establishment ssm major step forward help address shortcoming but, alone, sufficient. single supervision need accompany system power restructure wind fail bank minimize cost taxpayers. this also main thrust financial stability board’s (fsb) key attribute resolution. this le bank union about. the regain confidence bank sector key reverse recent development towards financial fragmentation help re-establish well-functioning interbank market capital flows. these key importance also restore economic growth single market programme. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the overall bank union framework – key element slide: key element bank union the first element single rule book. the eu objective develop single rule book, base idea maximum harmonization basic regulatory requirement (such capital adequacy rules) leave leeway national authority impose strict requirement nationally systemic stability macro-prudential reasons. the single rule book bank base crr/crd4/deposit guarantee directive upcoming bank recovery resolution directive complement bind standard issue european bank authority (eba). the eba legal competence develop monitor implementation single rule book. the eba also task move ahead harmonization supervisory practices. the ssm develop strongly harmonize supervisory practice (“supervisory manual”) order create single system – also extend small banks. it expect ssm manual significantly detail eba’s handbook, two need consistent therefore close cooperation already start ssm eba. the establishment ssm second element bank union. the ssm unitary supervisory system, compose national competent authority ecb – close cooperation – possibility non-euro area member state participate. the ecb assume direct supervisory responsibility major decision make power significant bank meet certain criteria. we expect number bank reach 130–140. i discus ssm detail while. before that, let go third element bank union establishment single resolution mechanism (srm). an important pre-condition would swift adoption bank recovery resolution directive (brr), lay harmonise toolbox resolution powers. the single resolution mechanism would build measure tool lay directive, particularly provide robust framework allow prompt coordinate resolution action, specifically cross-border bank concerned. an efficient resolution mechanism include possibility bail-in bank debt-holders key element new policy objective bail-in predominant tool resolution limit use bail-outs far possible. in new regime, bail-in rule, bail-out rare exception. a know, swift orderly resolution cross-border bank achilles heel need addressed. for purpose, one need move national supranational arrangement significant banks. i need remind would particularly important highly integrate nordic bank market. the draft brr require national resolution authority cooperate resolution college establish resolution authority country bank business operations. however, draft brr exist arrangement contain compulsory coordination resolution measure take home host authorities. hence, explicit bind resolution mechanism cross-border banks. conflict interest incentive geographical ring-fencing plague cross-border crisis management previous case still embed current framework. both home host authority exercise ring-fencing discretion. it doubtful resolution college could effectively coordinate time necessary decision involve resolution cross-border bank group resolve conflict interest. we need establishment srm good decision make procedure – hopefully long run – european resolution authority implement successfully resolution process across country participate ssm. in bi central bankers’ speech 3 absence srm, ecb would hand problem bank back national authority could also create conflict interest national authority could disagree measure take supervisory side deviate desire course exercise resolution. the srm institutional geographical scope ssm. ideally, long run, single resolution authority, would centre srm, govern resolution bank coordinate application resolution tools. it comprehensive set enforceable tools, power authority resolve bank ssm. in particular would ensure fail bank resolve swiftly, impartial decision-making focus european dimension. the timely resolution bank avoid cascade problem one bank banks, thereby affect european financial stability. in view, bank union establish without simultaneous creation pan-european deposit guarantee scheme (dgs). harmonisation national dg use could already sufficient step forward, include ex ante collection fund bank deposit guarantee funds. key feature plan supervisory mechanism slide: timeline establishment ssm if go well, european parliament vote 7 july ssm regulation could enter force begin august year – mean actual operation ssm could start august 2014, ecb could assume direct supervisory duties. the ssm operate system, cater expertise national supervisor time possess strong decision-making centre. appropriate decentralisation procedure planned, preserve unity supervisory system avoid duplication. the ssm, ecb centre, entrust extensive set micro- macro- prudential powers, cover key task relate prudential supervision credit institutions. this broad array task power crucial, foundation ssm effectively supervise banks. the ssm also posse early intervention power foresee draft brr. these early intervention power significant relate governance scope activity institution start serious problem lead point non-viability. to ensure strong centre, ecb’s overall responsibility supervision within ssm match control power system whole, well close cooperation arrangement national authorities. what make ssm work truly one system, besides legal competence banks, follow main features:  first, component system act accordance system guidelines, ecb specific regulation manual supervisory practices.  second, ecb supervisory function, centre, receive supervisory data, regard banks.  third, body center system, ecb supervisory function, power overtake direct supervision bank group bank may consider relevant may origin systemic risk.  fourth, center supervise monitor overall supervisory quality follow national competent authorities. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in practice, risk-based approach supervision adopted. joint supervisory team establish integrate ecb national competent authority (nca) staff single supervisory unit responsible conduct on-going supervisory activity prepare supervisory decisions. the team establish coordinate ecb; likely one team significant bank group, tailor need bank group (proportionality). a common ssm risk assessment system developed, rely integrate harmonize information base. the system use address capital liquidity need bank ssm also direct supervisory resource (e.g. inspections’ planning) basis risk- impact assessment. the supervision nordic bank group – nordea danske bank – interest perspective particular home-country authority group remain outside ssm. in situation, ecb assume responsibility host supervisor major subsidiary euro area also significant bank enter ssm supervision. slide: supervision nordea bank union take nordea example. the supervisory college continue operate swedish leadership coordinate overall supervisory activity form picture risks, capital liquidity group level. a new element ecb participate supervisory college responsible authority euro area subsidiaries, present host authority finland estonia still join supervisory cooperation behalf; important also maintain full picture financial stability respective countries. should difference opinion emerge; eba mediate home authority ecb. the picture would become different, sweden denmark decide join ssm. it would simplify supervisory structure nordic authority would operate ssm roof. the ssm also power macro-prudential area, share competence national macro-prudential authorities. the ecb comment national measure possibility tighten national measure deem inadequate. macro-prudential instrument could also apply euro-area financial system whole, addition individual countries. the crisis show supervise micro-prudential risk individual bank separately sufficient macro- micro- risk actually mutually reinforcing. there close cooperation macro-and micro-prudential functions. the share competence important two reasons. first, system need establish way create incentive action, ie pre-crises prevail national inaction bias need broken. second, credit cycle differ nationally associate potential problem need mitigate nationally diverge ways. this different approach compare monetary policy monetary union bank supervision, aim maximum harmonization national practices. key milestone preparation ssm slide: key milestone preparation ssm the practical preparation ssm well underway since last autumn. in summer main element supervisory model supervisory manual rather developed. the go ecb framework regulation, regulation ecb set main responsibility ecb national authority main requirement set bank ssm. also summer main feature ssm risk assessment system (ras) available well finalize list significant bank enter ssm direct supervision. bi central bankers’ speech 5 during autumn 2013 spring 2014 newly establish ssm supervisory board first consult adopt basic document set operation ssm, would start summer 2014. i would like emphasize supervisory board main body responsible supervisory function ssm main decision make body, even decision formally finally adopt govern council european central bank. when come role govern council, cannot alter decision supervisory board, prevent entry force veto power exercised, strongly justify e.g. monetary policy reasons. hence, decision make well internal ecb organization, separation monetary policy supervisory function realized. during 2013 2014 also ecb supervisory organization staff start operation. of particular relevance credible start ssm balance sheet assessment (bsa) –project, make sure major problem asset quality well-known sufficiently address operational start ssm. the bsa also link pan-european stress test conduct close cooperation eba ssm spring 2014. i believe interest country join ssm beginning, follow level standard asset quality review apply within ssm. non-euro area country join ssm (member state close cooperation) slide: member state close cooperation national competent authority non-euro area member state option participate ssm. they participate establish close cooperation agreement ecb. by give non-euro area member state full membership vote right supervisory body, body responsible preparation decision supervisory matters, place equal foot euro-area member states. while ecb govern council ultimate decision-making body ecb, role ssm reduce possibility accept reject decision supervisory board. this accept level european council government seem indicate might see extension ssm well beyond euro area. join ssm would mean supervisory process ssm would apply also non-euro area banks. this would give benefit streamline unify supervisory process major cross-border banks. the special status non-euro area country take account decision-making mechanism. a i noted, govern council enforce decision supervisory board. if council prevent entry force decision, e.g. result modification decision, non-ea country may announce non-satisfaction decision. if council decision prevails, non-ea country choose adopt decision. on side then, ecb could consider breaking-up agreement close cooperation close lady gentlemen, let conclude say take significant step road towards bank union. however, many step ahead reach goal high quality comprehensive pan-european supervision resolution system. creation ssm steadily track soon see commission’s proposal srm. it worth mention nature supervision resolution task keep hand independent official without political involvement. such system, clear rule establish participants, 6 bi central bankers’ speech would greatly reduce contingent liability place tax payer reduce presumption bail-outs. i convince step worth take lead u towards efficient credible european framework. if financial crisis teach u something, sooner

bi central bankers’ speech 1 luis m linde: overview spain’s economy 2012 – reflection outlook testimony mr luis m linde, governor bank spain, parliamentary committee economic affair competitiveness, madrid, 20 june 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, i appear committee occasion presentation banco de españa annual report 2012, one difficult year spanish economy last decades. i shall begin review general economic situation, focus progress achieve restore major balance economy, development credit household corporate debt, headway balance sheet clean-up restructure bank system, financial regulation reform progress european bank union project. i shall conclude reflection outlook economy. situation outlook spanish economy throughout 2012 spanish economy hold contractionary course first become discernible late 2011. gdp fell 1.4% year, far 0.5% decline record euro area whole. this double-dip recession, second dip le acute term decline output persistent 2008–2009 forerunner, particularly serious consequence employment, shrink fifth year run 2012. the main macroeconomic financial figure 2012 speak regard intensity adjustment make attempt overcome serious imbalance emerge last upturn. the fall household income, prompt heavy decline employment, along high household debt, continue exert contractionary effect spend capacity overall background uncertainty. once 2012, companies, many immerse deleveraging financial restructure processes, cut investment, adjustment construction sector continued. meanwhile, general government sector tailor spend plan need reduce budget deficit, follow serious budgetary slippage evidence close 2011. all factor combine bring strong decline national demand, partly offset positive contribution external sector. import fell forcefully, mirror weakness final demand, export expand despite poor performance euro area markets, spain still direct half foreign sales. however, development date 2013 appear confirm bad second recession behind us. the big decline output end 2012, late data suggest contraction gdp easing. indeed, final stretch year, even third quarter onwards, positive growth rate might recorded. fiscal consolidation significant step take last year reduce budget deficit strengthen budgetary discipline management framework. in first areas, although expenditure- revenue-side measure applied, stress bulk effort consist spend cuts, allow 2 bi central bankers’ speech net overall general government borrow reduce 7% gdp, 10.6% assistance (a non-recurring expense) financial institution included. last month european commission announce new fiscal consolidation path, set new deficit target 6.5% 5.8% current year, 2013, 2014, around 4% 2015, require 3% threshold lay stability growth pact meet 2016. the additional margin provide help soften short-term contractionary impact fiscal adjustment activity. a public spend discipline management, i first mention april 2012 organic law budgetary stability. this legislation implement principle limit structural deficit volume debt enshrine constitution 2011. the law make key improvement term transparency public finances. many improvement set train 2012 early 2013. in term availability data general government financial budgetary conduct, spain probably stand head european union countries. to highlight significant improvements, stability law firstly set minimum report requirement regional local government, include monthly revenue spend outturn regional governments, quarterly one local governments, along information need calculate budget outturn national account terms. moreover, since june 2012, igae (national audit office) regularly publish quarterly account general government sub-sectors national account terms, individual basis regional government aggregate term local government. also, since october 2012, monthly regional government account regularly publish budgetary account term and, since march 2013, national account terms. further, last march, monthly national account figure central government social security system begin released, complement monthly state data national account cash-basis terms, monthly social security system data cash-basis term publish three decades. apart report improvements, stability law include mechanism correct slippage budget outturn. the independent fiscal responsibility authority, whose creation schedule end year, complete new governance framework. the pension system the sustainability pension system pivotal medium- long-term soundness stability public finance credibility consolidation programme total public spending. this area substantial measure already adopted, vital maintain thrust reform. our current social security pension system contributory unfunded, necessarily continue so. it fundamental factor economic social stability, mean everybody’s interest address risk shortfall, essentially due demographic developments. to sustainable, system must able properly control key elements, retirement age, calculation pension so-called “sustainability factor”, currently defined. it welcome news practically political force work spirit toledo pact approve almost 25 year ago repeatedly receive support parliamentary institutions. but imperative point that, long run, potential unfunded system ensure retiree enjoy standard live step level income achieve work life may limited. accordingly, supplementary capitalisation formula must explore allow scope save work life. these supplementary systems, example different countries, may private also public. in bi central bankers’ speech 3 event, take long time drive nature mature, also everybody’s interest set study put place necessary arrangement soon possible. progress correct external imbalance it external sector swift sharp correction imbalance made. the adjustment external sector continue 2012 and, result, post surplus second half year (an unprecedented development since launch emu), current account practically balance, deficit 0.2% gdp year whole. current forecast point surplus current account 2013, 2014 successive years. in addition contraction import attributable fall-off domestic spending, performance reflect restore competitiveness lose spanish economy expansion end 2008. by late 2012, two-thirds gap build since 2000 spanish unit labour cost euro area average already corrected. these gain competitiveness accompanied, recent period, notable growth number export firm great geographical diversification exports, ever-increasing weight target emerge markets. competitiveness market reform to put favourable external sector performance firm footing, must build improvement competitiveness. in connection, market factor good service must function way conducive contain costs, margin prices. clearly, labour market, need stable employment-promoting regulatory framework which, time, afford sufficient flexibility attune work condition circumstance business cycle. indeed, great moderation flexibility see wage-setting recent quarters, – also important – less degree indexation. a intensive use wage non-wage flexibility mechanism envisage new regulatory framework would lend continuity ongoing improvement competitiveness. but problem lack flexibility competition labour market. in market good services, recently approve national reform plan include set measure aim remove obstacle competition, attain productivity gain various sector improve function various institutions. private-sector deleveraging lend the overindebtedness household firm another major problem arise last upturn spanish economy. private debt/gdp ratio fall peak 2010, relatively slow pace. the main explanation sluggishness lie downturn private-sector nominal income since onset crisis. unlike economy problem excess household corporate debt, unite kingdom unite states, spain weak nominal growth weigh process debt re-balancing make reside, all, contraction lending. the last year lend post positive rate change spain 2008. since then, net credit flows, household non-financial corporations, 4 bi central bankers’ speech negative overall, although slight increase lend household house purchase 2010. in 2012, total lend resident non-financial private-sector fell 5.8%; credit household fell 3.7% non-financial corporation decrease 8%. when total credit productive activity exclude construction, real estate development financial service considered, decline sharp, stand 6%. indeed, credit productive activity exclude construction, real estate development financial service slightly positive 2010, negative 2011, 2012 2013 date. in consider development evidently bear mind credit construction real estate development activity shrink cyclical upturn end excess period 2004–2008 corrected. the problem naturally lie negative rate credit flow productive activity construction development, contraction credit households, house purchase purposes. and, addition problem volume, problem prices; household firm pay high interest rate average rate pay comparable transaction euro area whole, although spread small case finance house purchase, high consumer loan also substantial credit obtain non-financial corporations. to explain must look supply-side factor relate loanable fund banks, demand-side factor part borrowers, household firms. concern demand credit, recessionary environment, high unemployment, hitherto scant growth prospect uncertainty evidently affect potential borrowers. on supply side, neither liquidity – provide stable fashion low cost eurosystem – shortage capital would appear significant explanatory factors. we believe supply side two influential factor deleveraging bank lack project may deem solvent, offer sufficient guarantees. there fact figure confirm dynamic productive company obtain financing; trajectory export good indicator respect. yet, time, know many small medium-sized company (smes) – good result prospects, current payment bank – difficulty finance even work capital, high cost. there factor affect credit flows, supply demand sides. our bank map change considerably recent years, disappearance transformation many save bank which, different regions, traditionally lend many smes. that lead adjustment bank balance sheet new work relationship credit institution customers, may, least temporarily, influence credit flows. the need deleveraging consideration credit institutions, also non-financial corporation households; early stated, household firm incur high many case unsustainable debt level 2008–2010. indeed, good number analyst agree that, order expand again, productive sector need capital credit, give correction excessive debt concluded, without rule fact that, evidently, pick-up economic growth may assist correction. in event, economic recovery without pick-up credit flows. but latter cannot ensue administrative rule ignore economic rationality lead mistake decision standpoint solvency banks, include public-sector institutions. that said, measure study reactivate credit entire economy and, particular, smes export sector. the european investment bi central bankers’ speech 5 bank mean stimulate loan smes increase fund european public-sector bank operate area. new arrangement could also study risk-sharing use european funds, example structural funds, possibility already discussion. and specific scheme boost export credit could studied. within eurosystem, banco de españa always favour initiative gear support cheap credit, unconventional monetary policy measure help restore monetary policy transmission mechanisms. but know normalisation credit come about, slow difficult, complete clean-up reinforcement solvency bank system. this important clearly understand do 2012 overcome crisis evaluate current state affairs. clean-up, recapitalisation restructure bank system financial reform i shall focus six issue afford u overview situation: clean-up effort 2012, strengthen solvency, improve liquidity position, development non-performing loans, expectation result current year, and, finally, regulatory change approve 2012. clean-up firstly, balance sheet write-downs. two step take 2012 fundamentally determine balance sheet write-down spanish banks’ income statement absorb. the first requirement, lay royal decree february may 2012, set aside provision reinforce coverage loan real estate development construction sector foreclose assets. the second balance sheet write-down stem compulsory transfer sareb (the asset management company asset arise bank restructuring), agree price, asset belong balance sheet segment i mentioned. this transfer, make bank restructure resolution, affect asset total €107 billion term gross book value, transfer value €50.6 billion. with measures, spanish banks’ exposure above-mentioned real estate risk fall since 2011 slightly half, €240 billion €115 billion. in sum, write-down spanish bank 2012 total €87 billion, compare €32 billion 2011. solvency secondly, solvency. despite fact major clean-up provision drive spanish bank system 2012 result total loss €43.7 billion, system’s level solvency improved. that possible thank recapitalisation operation perform directly tap markets; capital injection finance financial assistance programme agree european authorities, final amount €39 billion; conversion hybrid instrument capital instruments; fund provide frob deposit guarantee fund. currently, spanish bank meet regulatory capital ratio required. a close first quarter year, solvency ratio bank system 11.6%, compare current minimum 8% require basel accord. it worth stress – certain comment make seek omit completely misinterpret – fundamental intention effect capital injection public fund (whether european stability mechanism spanish treasury) prevent winding-up banks, thereby preserve customer deposits. 6 bi central bankers’ speech it would remiss mention problem hybrid capital subordinate debt instrument sell retail customer credit institution which, follow detection capital shortfall stress test complete last september, unable cover capital need resource receive state aid. these banks, require public financial assistance, subject term memorandum understand sign 20 july 2012, law 9/2012 restructure resolution credit institution and, consequently, european commission’s arrangement govern state aid. the banco de españa, directly frob deposit guarantee fund, via participation arbitrage committee set last march, collaborate authority involve bank find best possible solution serious multi-faceted problem; instrument same, sell way, give treatment european regulations. liquidity thirdly, liquidity. spain undergo serious external fund crisis 2012. the origin crisis lay crisis euro area negative market perception banks’ solvency. a feedback loop sovereign risk bank risk emerged, dominate so-called “redenomination risk”, i.e. risk certain country might abandon monetary union. that lead difficult situation external funding, liquidity supply european central bank allow u address. in last quarter 2012, however, tension ease liquidity bank begin improve. the debit position vis-à-vis ecb decrease €410 billion august 2012 slightly €250 billion last may. furthermore, access bank bond market improved. npl ratio fourth, npl ratio. in december 2012, initial phase transfer asset sareb, npl ratio stand 10.8%. by march increase 11.2%. the real estate development construction sector high npl ratio (29%), mortgage individual contain (4%), although tend rise. a result major effort make term write-down provision 2012 drastic decrease real estate risk, affirm bank able meet provision need may arise year, 2013, also 2014, any. result 2013 fifth, profit loss account. a indicated, 2012 large volume provision lead heavy losses. that said, margin perform positively due influence two factors: fall interest expense effort make many bank contain operate costs. particularly strong effort make bank restructure accordance plan approve frob, banco de españa european authorities, within framework memorandum understand july 2012. a year, preliminary data first quarter allow u moderately optimistic, since overall profit €4 billion reported. virtually bank group obtain profits. in short, eu institutions, ecb imf acknowledged, overcome bank crisis, although risk uncertainty persist mean certainly cannot consider crisis resolved. that said, need reiterate good way normalise credit flow complete task. bi central bankers’ speech 7 regulatory change sixth finally, discuss progress make bank union project, i would like refer, briefly, important change 2012 financial regulation directly relate handle bank crisis. the significant legal change financial area law 9/2012 14 november 2012 restructure resolution credit institution strengthen frob’s role anticipate future directive regulate process europe. royal decree 1559/2012 subsequently regulate asset management company and, particular, regime applicable sareb. finally, area bank customer protection, mention make royal decree-law 6/2012 9 march 2012 establish various measure protect mortgage borrower difficulty, include code good practices, virtually spanish bank institution adhered. and, second, banco de españa circular 5/2012 27 june 2012 complete new legislation area, develop concept “responsible lending” enhance information system applicable bank products. a bank supervision, banco de españa, compliance provision memorandum understand 20 july 2012, perform internal review supervisory procedures. it create committee purpose deliver find last october. this committee make series recommendation banco de españa consider already lead change organisational chart bank supervision department procedures. however, implementation supervisory mechanism european central bank, expect take place one year, clearly involve need change supervisory procedure organisation. consequently, need proceed prudently area, adaptation new european model first consideration. progress toward bank union the decisive push towards bank union give european summit june 2012, time grave uncertainty tension euro area. bank union must understood, conceive outset, essential step sever link bank risk sovereign risk bolster soundness irreversibility monetary union. the bank union underpin three basic pillars: single supervisor, harmonise resolution arrangement european resolution authority common resolution fund. to date, progress mix three areas. the european parliament shortly approve legislation create single supervisory mechanism, european central bank play central role. the single supervisor become operational twelve month approval, first ecb must analyse solvency institution supervise, exercise incorporate new stress test perform european bank authority next year. the directive establish harmonise resolution regime – currently debate european council european parliament – legislation create european authority common resolution fund still pending approval. in latter case, proposal must submitted, date yet specified, european commission. conclusion lady gentlemen, theme speech difficult adjustment spanish economy currently go through, need see context largely unprecedented international european setting. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the advance economies, unite states, european union, unite kingdom japan operate extremely loose monetary conditions, exceptionally abundant liquidity low interest rates. emerge situation without impact growth without create fresh financial turmoil easy considerable risk encounter along path. emerge country continue record high growth rates, momentum weaken 2014 weakness may become pronounced. in euro area scenario weak economic growth despite improvement since summer 2012, monetary financial market remain fragment uncertainty monetary union governance european union completely dispelled. in spain, make significant progress correct imbalance affect capacity grow i think right path achieve recovery activity creation employment sound basis. however, essential abandon policy reform aim increase flexibility economy boost competitiveness. the fundamental task outstanding banco de españa is, help close cooperation government resolute support bank sector, complete balance sheet clean-up bank system, afford utmost solvency, efficiency transparency. this target, bring system fulfil key function intermediate saver investor enjoy full trust customer depositors, will, hard work rigour, within reach. but need something more: restore economic growth, revive investment, create job overcome bank financial crisis, require legal security. i take opportunity request work resolutely safeguard strengthen it. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jörg asmussen: intervention panel “the future europe” speech mr jörg asmussen, member executive board european central bank, iif (institute international finance) 2013 spring membership meeting, paris, 26 june 2013. * * * mr prot, lady gentlemen, thank invite speak panel. a central bank euro area, bank union key concern ecb. it essential increase confidence euro area bank sector, reintegrate financial markets, improve transmission monetary policy. it therefore among important issue euro area today. while bank union comprise number regulatory legislative initiatives, moment two key priorities. first, single supervisory mechanism (ssm). second, single resolution mechanism (srm), operate legal framework establish bank recovery resolution directive (brrd). a common deposit guarantee scheme, important, something longer-term. let say word elements, fit together. start ssm, expect regulation approve european parliament september ecb take supervisory responsibility one year thereafter. in meantime, preparatory work underway involve close cooperation ecb national authority competent supervision. the work include map euro area bank system, develop supervisory model and, perhaps topically, prepare comprehensive assessment bank come direct ecb supervision. this require regulation apply around 130 140 bank group operate euro area. the assessment involve asset quality review balance sheet assessment conduct ecb first quarter 2014. this fee overall stress test conduct eba, cooperation ecb, second quarter 2014. our objective ssm start clean slate restore credibility european bank sector two previous stress test fail so. we therefore aim assessment rigorous possible. it clear result asset quality review stress test may require recapitalisation mean support weak banks. if bank cannot raise new capital themselves, fiscal backstop tap need national budget exist esm facilities. direct bank recapitalisation via esm – exception rare unlikely case – available ssm fully operational. however, build ssm’s credibility require transparency banks’ asset quality. market also need confident that, future, supervisor “pull trigger” bank fail likely fail. this mean must mechanism wind bank without cause financial instability. and srm also essential element bank union. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in view, srm comprise european resolution authority back single resolution fund. the rationale mainly concern deal large, cross-border banks. for resolve institutions, central authority make swift, impartial decision key. moreover, need share resource european level avoid protract wrangle national government share cost resolution. these resources, however, would come taxpayer. the resolution fund would finance provide ex ante risk-based levy bank sector. in build-up phase, public support would recoup additional ex post levy banks. this consistent emerge consensus europe, also reflect brrd, financial sector pay cost crises. indeed, relevant provision brrd enter force, bail-in use primary tool recapitalise bank fall minimum supervisory levels. it therefore important agree approach bail-in allow limit flexibility ensure financial stability, still provide ex ante peck order clear rules. global investor need certainty rule game europe. a regard date brrd enter force, i believe start early 2015 provide clarity legal certainty investor delay new regime 2018. and since market participant likely anticipate new rule even late date chosen, may well aim 2015 brrd enter force. why common deposit guarantee scheme also agenda? the reason strong resolution framework lessen need it, least medium-term. under brrd, bank maintain minimum level liability eligible bailed-in, mean shareholder creditor absorb majority losses. moreover, seem likely brrd contain depositor preference rule, insure deposit give high priority. this mean extreme case deposit guarantee scheme pay out. national arrangements, harmonise deposit guarantee scheme directive, therefore sufficient. take together, two element – ssm srm – form robust foundation bank union. it essential make progress parallel. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 matthew elderfield: central bank ireland’s progress improve financial regulation supervision open statement mr matthew elderfield, deputy governor central bank ireland, public account committee, dublin, 13 june 2013. * * * i would like thank committee invite back discus progress make improve financial regulation supervision since i last may 2010, time discuss comptroller auditor general’s report lesson financial crisis. there lot grind could cover, i think best do discussion, let extremely brief open remarks. i would like spend minute describe progress make three key areas: supervisory capability approach, regulatory standard power and, finally, regulatory philosophy, include role enforcement. and let mention one final loose end cag’s special report 72, relate auditor assurance statements. but i sound note caution outset: good progress make improve financial regulation supervision ireland, mean way yet. indeed, supervisor almost always play catch industry dangerous think get point rest laurels. so, important maintain momentum improvements, keep regulatory framework date ensure supervisory capability always best. it’s also especially important vigilant backslide attempt compromise independence dilute diligence regulation, especially time start get good. in term supervisory capability approach, clear supervision under-resourced range area therefore staff level necessarily increase last years. my original estimation regulatory function central bank would need 725 persons-strong, base experience, process improvement efficiencies, i would think target level around 600 sensible end current three year central bank strategy 2015. continually strive improve quality also important, ensure right mix experience invest training, supervisor skill challenge firm effectively. ensure central bank attract retain skill need doubt become increasingly demand challenge market relevant specialise skill improves. six hundred supervisor ten thousand regulate entity require strategic choice resource allocation, new risk-assessment framework develop call prism (probability risk impact system). this involve implicit exercise set risk appetite, term ensure adequate resource level firm pose big potential impact customer financial stability fail. our prism system also provide framework systematically score firm risk pose particular category (like credit risk market risk), communicate along risk mitigation plan – “to list” plain english – firm address. this system new central bank past couple year reflect best international practice ass risk organised, consistent systematic manner. this framework provide guarantee failure never occur – indeed expect continue small firm – mean closely “man mark” large firm order reduce risk failure. if supervision police rules, regulation set rule themselves. there busy international agenda regulatory change feed ireland via european union. i sympathy industry volume change take place challenge pose implementation. at 2 bi central bankers’ speech domestic level, central bank focus initiative taken, statutory code corporate governance new framework fitness probity major change impact sectors. these help fill important gap regulation. i also grateful successive government member house support provide upgrade supervisory enforcement power available central bank, legislation area close final adoption. this welcome step improve regulatory framework. go forward, important keep fine tune rule base emerge international best practice. finally, brief survey, word regulatory philosophy. the lesson financial crisis clear, supervision regulation light touch. a imf says, good supervision fact intrusive. and patrick honohan say review, supervisor need decisive follow issues. our prism system design provide framework prompt action; example closely track progress risk mitigation plans. but heart approach need robust regulatory philosophy encourage challenge: describe “assertive risk base supervision underpin credible enforcement deterrent”. this design put concept front centre: operate risk-based approach, differentiate base impact probability; consequence accountability non-compliance; supervisor empower insist upon action mitigate risk satisfy explanation firm’s management. a today’s session is, i understand, formally design help close committee’s review cag’s report lesson financial crisis, special report 72, let note one loose end recommendation still need concluded, relate introduction auditor assurance statements. we conduct preliminary consultation stakeholder believe risk-based framework, obligation apply high impact firm only, best proportionate way forward. the central bank supervision enforcement bill provide clear mandate introduce assurance requirements, legislation adopt progress conclusion. there lot grind could cover i sure area committee interest discussing. this short introduction way highlight key area perspective. i thank committee attention look forward discussion answer questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 sabine lautenschläger: from supervision resolution – german perspective speech m sabine lautenschläger deputy president deutsche bundesbank, institute international european affairs, dublin, 25 june 2013. * * * 1. introduction dear mr halligan, lady gentleman i would like thank much invitation. it pleasure come dublin discus new development relate bank union great importance europe. the title remark refer “german perspective”. i would like talk vision, deutsche bundesbank. and – i make secret – i case put today. one jam joyce’s famous literary characters, stephen dedalus, observe error portal discovery. have fail prevent crisis first place, policy maker supervisor alike least rightly call learn right lessons. one lesson bank union, launch june 2012. the eurozone summit resolved, amongst things, transfer bank supervision ecb. further element add december 2012. these include single supervisory mechanism (ssm) single resolution mechanism (srm) euro area. a single european deposit insurance scheme also discussed. add single resolution mechanism single supervisory mechanism is, opinion, good idea, one whose time come. control liability go hand hand. but european resolution mechanism likewise need harmonise standard instruments, currently develop eu’s bank recovery resolution directive (brrd). if i may say here: irish presidency distinguish admirably difficult negotiations. the third pillar bank union – european deposit insurance scheme – currently regard priority task. i concur view. after all, deposit insurance scheme promise government depositor indemnify certain degree event crisis. a joint deposit insurance scheme would thus necessarily mean joint liability member states’ taxpayers. however, joint liability area require joint european control economic fiscal policy. and nowhere near stage yet. however, condition meet effective efficient bank union, concern material supervisory legislation: centralise european supervisory regime require common supervisory rules. the adoption capital requirement regulation capital requirement directive, probable entry force 1 january 2014, bring u major step close “single rulebook” bank supervisor alike. i would also like give warm thank congratulation irish presidency here, too, negotiate organisational skill thorny matter, one few four presidency work hard that. well done! 2. single supervisory mechanism where thing stand regard single supervisory mechanism, ssm? where i stand? a fundamental political consensus achieved. a formal resolution germany still pending, however, significant transfer power require two-thirds majority germany’s two house parliament. the require majority 2 bi central bankers’ speech reach bundestag, low house, 14 june 2013; bundesrat, upper house, vote 5 july 2013. i trust everything go smoothly, single supervisory mechanism regulation enter force late summer that, second half 2014, european central bank (ecb) start supervise bank cooperation national supervisors. i expect major benefit forthcoming european cross-border supervision banks. the last five years, particular, brutally show u crisis stop national borders, especially monetary union. an advantage ssm draw broad good basis information across eurozone, thereby make possible reveal undesirable development quickly. if design correctly, strong arm benchmarking peer review, uncover trend individual business line risk management much sooner future. i also expect major step towards consistent application supervisory rules, second pillar single rulebook, speak. i hop european supervision, team supervisor various nations, provide new approach incorporate best element nation’s approach supervision. this new approach leave room “home biased” supervisory regime. however, ssm also major weaknesses, i would like single one particular emphasis. it fact final say central decision take ecb – thus also ssm – rest govern council ecb. it true decision prepare supervisory board, compose representative eurozone national supervisory authority central banks, govern council ecb accept reject proposals. a mediation panel would resolve disagreements. however, govern council would ultimate responsibility matter what. i misgive setup, two reasons. first: governance structure quite complex, functional viability still need demonstrated. i admit i side sceptic here. second: possible draw clear divide line monetary policy supervision: single supervisory mechanism regulation go far eu primary law allows. i therefore see ecb face conflict aims: price stability stable bank system. this conflict aim threaten ecb’s “internal independence”. over medium long term, i believe necessary put ssm sound legal footing; get around change primary law improve governance structure draw clear line monetary supervisory functions. i convince need tackle issue changes. 3. single resolution mechanism let turn second main topic today: single resolution mechanism (srm). the financial market crisis show u magnitude hazard cost associate buzzword “too big” “too complex fail”. the g20 government therefore commit take measure prevent taxpayer bail distress banks. the onus policymakers supervisor develop bank resolution restructure process. this issue take new dimension context joint supervision. after all, within cross-border supervisory structure, also common restructure resolution regime order achieve balance liability control. to end, establish central european resolution agency joint european resolution fund. in order make single european restructure resolution regime lawsuit-proof, change primary law require here, too. in view, current legal framework establishment special resolution authority euro area, extensive power bi central bankers’ speech 3 intervention, insufficient. a european resolution authority extensive power intervene, legal basis must absolutely watertight. resolution invariably follow lawsuit – much certain. what shape resolution authority take practice? transfer relevant task eu commission, limit subset member states, even transitional period, really good idea. it harbour legal pitfalls: restrict authority’s power euro area hardly cover article 114 treaty function european union (tfeu) also pose threat conflict interest. resolution state aid would merge one single authority. a context ssm, area, too, policy maker call upon tackle determination task lay groundwork eu primary legislation independent resolution authority. 4. hierarchy liability what unfinished business there? well, is, all, issue instrument procedure apply bank resolve restructured. at events, resolution restructure bank supervise directly ecb require common instrument procedures, also benefit eu country join ssm. i therefore welcome irish presidency’s effort push ahead highly complex controversial brrd dossier. the crucial precondition finalise dossier agree ultimately foot bill. to end, need define hierarchy liability clearly ex ante: shareholder first bear losses; suffice must hesitate bail junior senior debt holder well – least time. the big issue currently whether deposit put class hierarchy liability – words, “depositor preference”. some member state also want deposits, least insure €100,000, exempt bail-in. a privately finance resolution fund line defence. all bank supervise directly ecb would contribute joint european resolution fund, would supersede national regime medium term. this fund also able require additional payment member banks. every then, i hear notion eurosystem could also make contribution, instance, provide bridge loans. i don’t think that’s good idea. true, central bank provide emergency liquidity – bank suffer temporary liquidity shortages. however, may not, not, contribute aid towards resolution restructuring, easily cross line fiscal policy. a last resort, however, fund could request public financial assistance example, esm, could threat which, extraordinary cases, could require recourse public funding. 5. direct recapitalisation esm public fund buzzword hot-button issue, one inseparably link question: public suppose funding? should nation-states call pay whenever crisis occurs, joint european fund? i see compel reason cost bank restructure shift entirely european level. you see: weal woe bank depend competence management also external factors: quality supervision; financial economic strength borrowers, turn hinge nation’s economic policy; also fiscal policy country bank based. ample proof assertion 4 bi central bankers’ speech provide fact bank’s fund cost dependent sovereign credit rat home country. although centralise supervision europe next year, factor economic fiscal policy remain largely responsibility individual nations. and, long case, argument shift loss completely european level appear compelling. the balance sheet assessment provide article 27 ssm regulation also acquire major significance context: article require ecb ass portfolio quality bank supervise future. what regulation say, however, happen hide loss disclosed. i two thing say this. i consider balance sheet assessment important. for successful, base assessment banks’ balance sheet supervisors’ judgements. we also enlist outside specialist – external auditor – quantitative assessment. not order restore market participants’ confidence european bank industry, also minimise reputational risk ecb. all supervisor europe familiar ad hoc examinations. these precisely instrument use here. this way avert suspicion national supervisor take much account national special circumstances. my remark follow directly: concern legacy risk bank supervise ssm. a risk create past, responsibility individual member states, bear national context, too. 6. change primary law i twice mention change primary law context bank union: refer ssm regard srm. i indeed aware many recoil think change primary law, long wind road. ultimately, however, project create bank union similar creation single monetary policy. and, thing properly start establish sound legal foundation. if good enough establish monetary union, good enough bank union. that notwithstanding, i think ssm restructure resolution mechanism launch prior change eu primary law. however, start work amendment primary law right away, give foreseeable difficulty amount time endeavour probably take. 7. significance single supervisory mechanism bundesbank while i today, ecb visit colleague bundesbank put “road show” extol virtue employer. a goethe’s faust put it: “two souls, alas! dwell breast” – much i look forward single supervisory mechanism, success many fellow bundesbankers instrumental, i very, sorry without bundesbank. the ssm, all, design manner quality expertise national supervisor continue decisive factor. this constituent eu – principle subsidiarity – place bank union, too. nonetheless, theme relate bank supervision resolution acquire new european dimension. and, long do well, be. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: stable euro, strong europe speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, wirtschaftstag 2013, berlin, 25 june 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure speak today. and i grateful invitation wirtschaftsrat, institution ground principle soziale marktwirtschaft tradition ludwig erhard. in speech berlin 18 month ago, i quote erhard’s famous dictum: “die soziale marktwirtschaft ist ohne eine konsequente politik d preisstabilität nicht denkbar”. so i happy accept host’s invitation reflect importance stable euro strong europe. all policy-makers contribute preserve stability common currency build strong prosperous europe. i would like emphasise personal commitment goal. i confident joint effort complete institutional architecture economic monetary union (emu), serve collective mission. the european central bank (ecb) unambiguous mandate performance measured: medium-term price stability, understand average annual inflation rate 2%. the ecb’s task track record with objective, continue 17 country deutsche bundesbank achieve germany. our history younger, pride i say ecb accomplish objective almost 15 years. and emphasis i say commit take exact objective future. the euro’s track record demonstrate ecb’s success attain objective. accord projections, end 2014, average annual inflation rate since start euro decline 1.97%. this inflation record long period well record large country part euro area half-century precede euro also compare well international context. the ecb’s track record therefore remarkable. our commitment take exact objective forward reflect inflation expectations. they confirm currency stable. survey- market-based measure inflation expectation firmly anchor level consistent definition price stability. in spirit ludwig erhard, ecb make contribution social market economy. the ecb’s response instrument have objective necessarily mean use instruments. the ecb inherit objective bundesbank, operate new different environment. 2 bi central bankers’ speech today’s economic monetary union large diverse single country, germany. it highly integrate still time fragmented. and comprise large number policy-makers fiscal, structural economic matters. all policy-makers recognise belong emu together policy well policy inaction create spillover members. this enormous responsibility government economic policy-makers. for ecb operate environment, responsible effective accomplish objective, use wide range instruments. some instrument standard, non-standard, base ecb statutes. the use instrument essential safeguard objective financial sovereign debt crisis. in run-up crisis, inappropriate fiscal, structural economic policy foster excessive build-up risk financial sector create vulnerability global scale. when crisis erupted, vulnerability place heavy burden central banks. in particular, threat financial meltdown jeopardise capability counteract downside risk price stability. the ecb act threat accord unambiguous mandate deliver price stability. we reduce main policy rate historical lows. this contribute stabilise investment consumption decision euro area. our action prevent steep fall aggregate demand ensure condition stable price euro area. in bank-based economy like euro area, monetary policy work banks, bank lend other, base mutual trust. in crisis, trust get lost, bank long lend other. face threat euro-area wide fund crisis, turn central bank. we, central bank, provide liquidity bank work them. they counterpart – act. there guarantee liquidity provide would end real economy acted, avoid even large credit crunch collapse part bank system. we design instrument provide long-term credit bank give reassurance could satisfy liquidity need extend period. this give bank clear fund perspective put position provide credit line real economy, line business assessment credit risks. ecb policy response past 12 month by mid-2012, crisis take new turn. we saw risk complete collapse credit markets. risk fiscal sustainability grow market distrust euro area country start spill respective bank sectors. close link sovereign bank threaten stability entire bank sector countries. while impairment transmission monetary policy ease countries, become entrench acute others. fracture transmission – new phenomenon since start emu – appear along national borders. investor suddenly lose confidence euro area could survive current composition. in fact, prospect claim certain government private company certain country could discharge euro become possibility. international investor start divest security issue government non-core economy private institution domicile countries. bi central bankers’ speech 3 germany become destination “safe-haven” flows. capital, deposit central bank liquidity leave periphery concentrate core. market interest rate germany fell bond price drive upwards, point, german bond market rate low ecb refinance rates! at time, loss liquidity bank fund capacity periphery produce tighten credit condition economies. interest rate bank customers, firm household drop core rise periphery. eventually, fragmentation financial condition become severe effectively lose steer ability monetary policy euro area whole. in environment, act. a main instrument, announce programme outright monetary transaction (omt) secondary government bond markets. the aim eliminate redenomination risk, namely uncertainty survival euro. since omt announce almost one year ago, benefit widely acknowledged. the glut liquidity core economy partly reabsorbed, deposit save return periphery. interest rate germany increase fall periphery. target balances, powerful summary indicator fragmentation, come one quarter peak last year. fund cost country stress fall substantially. both bank firm stress country able regain access market financing, fund raise capital. our initiative therefore beneficial all: banks, company household – benefit periphery core countries. let highlight feature omt essential bear mind. first, omt come strict effective conditionality attach programme european stability mechanism (esm). the initiative activate country submit policy conditionality lead policy reforms. government present choice reform omt. omt come reforms. and reform need discipline process monitor international surveillance country concerned. otherwise, omt activation. second, conditionality enhance independence effectiveness monetary policy. the reason conditionality necessary sufficient condition activate omt. we would act right condition effective use monetary policy instrument place. third, ecb would act compress spread artificially; contrary, believe spread naturally reflect underlie fiscal position sovereign economic prospect country. this also emphasise sovereign need market access qualify omt. fourth, omt entail transfer risk periphery core country via ecb’s balance sheet, beyond risk inevitable inherent implementation single monetary policy 17 sovereign states. the omt announcement low risk core countries: risk euro area break-up; risk arise target balance scenario; risk market interest rate distort safe-haven flows. 4 bi central bankers’ speech because omt, euro area stable resilient place invest year ago. indeed, i would say omt even essential see potential change monetary policy stance associate uncertainty jurisdiction integrate global economy. essential reform go forward so stand? in term monetary policy, price stability assured, overall economic outlook still warrant accommodative stance. we see sign stabilisation sentiment, even though uncertainty remain. and expect monetary stimulus improvement financial market support recovery late year. the situation improved; fragmentation receded; tentative sign stabilisation occurred. but monetary policy small part overall policy agenda overcome crisis lay foundation sustainable growth renew employment creation. governments, social partner important economic decision-makers live responsibilities, too. one key issue structural reform make euro area economy business friendly competitive global economy. there host indicator – global competitiveness indicator ease do business indicator – lay reform agenda uncertain terms: handful euro area country rank highly indicators. germany among them, thank resolute structural reform implement country ten year ago. these reform inspiration countries. many european country structural problems: take long get licenses, permit administrative authorisation countries; judicial system slower; regulation complex. structural reform may hurt vest interests, would clearly strengthen effectiveness, competitiveness and, yes, also fairness economies. another key issue growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. we mindful debt-based fiscal spend way growth. euro area government debt rise almost 20 percentage point gdp last 15 year 50 percentage point last 30 years. at time, growth fallen, 3.8% average 1970s 2.1% 1990s roughly zero now. debt spend avoid stagnation economic growth. but fiscal consolidation make much growth-friendly cut unproductive expenditures, establish credible detail medium-term fiscal plan low tax burden harm economic activity job creation particular. the third key issue ensure sound financial system. this current effort establish european bank union crucial. the aim bank union establish transparency, stability incentive-compatibility euro area financial market. conclusion i outline ecb – need do key domain european economic policy. the june 2012 summit important time great uncertainty provide clear vision necessary stable genuine economic monetary union. much implemented. and i confident project europe continue bi central bankers’ speech 5 evolve towards renew economic strength social cohesion base mutual trust, within across national borders, stability. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: swiss bank financial stability perspective introductory remark mr jean-pierre danthine, vice chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 20 june 2013. * * * a colleague thomas jordan explained, economic financial condition swiss bank sector continue challenging. against background, i would like examine situation swiss bank financial stability perspective, look first big bank move discussion domestically focus banks. big banks: strengthen resilience over past year, swiss big bank substantially improve capital situation. risk-weighted capital ratio raise markedly, bank well place international peer comparison. moreover, capital-building, credit suisse also raise leverage ratio considerably. measure term loss-absorbing capital – define common equity tier 1 capital plus high-trigger contingent capital instrument – leverage ratio big bank roughly level. however, give prevail risk environment loss incur recent crisis, snb still consider current leverage ratio swiss big bank low. in addition, number comparative study imply that, term leverage ratios, ubs credit suisse currently international average. the big banks’ publish plan strategy capital-building envisage improvement capital situation. accord plans, measure term loss-absorbing capital, end 2014, credit suisse ubs likely already meet risk-weighted capital requirement 13% apply 2019. moreover, plan lead substantial increase leverage ratio end 2014. the snb acknowledge big banks’ progress date recommend consistently fully implement plans, order strengthen resilience and, particular, improve leverage ratios. improve leverage ratio crucial give grow importance indicator measure banks’ resilience. credibility model-based risk-weighted asset the risk weight asset play key role determine capital requirement bank. all bank’s off-balance-sheet position multiply risk weight. the risky position, high weight. the figure risk-weighted asset (rwa) represent sum risk-weighted positions. require capital, turn, define percentage rwa. there two different approach set risk weights. under standardise approach, risk weight prescribe broad asset classes. under model-based approach, contrast, bank use internal model determine risk weight different assets. the credibility rwa base banks’ internal model increasingly call question market participants, analyst authority worldwide. it widely accept bank’s risk can, principle, accurately quantify use model-based approach use standardise approach. yet banks’ internal model extremely complex vary widely banks, owe use different model choice model parameters. this result different capital requirement bank similar asset structure. this make difficult accurately ass bank’s resilience, compare one bank another. 2 bi central bankers’ speech to increase usefulness credibility model-based approach, in-depth analysis need carry determine whether extent model-based approach standardise approach lead difference rwa. the standardise approach shortcomings. yet, since independent bank-specific model assumptions, provide market participant additional point reference assess level change model-based rwa. difference two approach must well explain sound economic rationale. if analysis reveal substantial inexplicable differences, strengthen market confidence model-based approach. otherwise, appropriate measure considered. this could, instance, entail set floor model-based rwa, recently introduce bank us. another option would introduce multiplier model-based risk weight specific positions, already impose finma mortgage loans. effort underway finma, support snb, analyse potential difference two approaches. in context, snb recommend big bank increase transparency regard risks. this includes, among things, publish internal measure total risk. disclose rwa accord standardise approach addition model-based rwa would likewise lead great transparency regard risks. great transparency would help make change model-based rwa easy understand, thereby increase credibility model-based approach. domestically focus banks: resilience lend policy i would like turn assessment domestically focus commercial banks. at present, risk bank primarily link situation momentum mortgage real estate markets. in environment historically low interest rates, build-up imbalance markets. on one hand, ratio mortgage loan gdp increase high level historical comparison. on other, growth real estate price persistently strong explain fundamental factors. owe developments, measure announce june 2012 reduce risk swiss mortgage market. these measure include revision self-regulation rule mortgage lend strict capital requirement mortgage loans. despite measure taken, however, imbalance continue build 2012. against background, federal council decide february 2013 activate countercyclical capital buffer, proposal snb. in light risk situation, fact capitalisation domestically focus bank significantly regulatory minimum requirement welcome development. indeed, compare previous year, bank even improve regulatory capitalisation slightly. moreover, domestically focus bank already meet finma’s capital buff requirements, go beyond basel iii. however, figure regulatory capital may overestimate true resilience banks. for one thing, risk real estate market particular partly take account regulatory capital requirements. for another, neither interest rate risk low diversification bank – whose activity centre domestic mortgage market – fully reflect capital requirements. these aspect currently particular importance three reasons. first, already mentioned, mortgage real estate market see build-up risk since june 2012. second, significant growth mortgage lend domestically focus banks. although growth momentum decline year-on-year, volume mortgage claim bank increase around 5%. third, banks’ risk appetite lend remain persistently high. for instance, large proportion new bi central bankers’ speech 3 mortgage grant owner-occupied residential property still loan-to-value ratio 80%. furthermore, share new loan stretch affordability also remain high level. at time, interest rate margin domestically focus bank narrow 2012, interest rate risk remain historically high. in view persistently low level interest rates, risk that, despite measure already implemented, imbalance swiss mortgage real estate market continue build up. this would increase likelihood consequence price correction medium term. such price correction could triggered, example, sharp increase interest rates. against background, domestically focus bank therefore continue ensure resilience sufficiently high, irrespective regulatory requirements, make adjustment necessary. they able maintain economically important functions, even real estate price fall sharply interest rate simultaneously rise. in particular, domestically focus bank make sure currently high direct interest rate risk assess manage use conservative assumptions. in context, assumption apply bank regard save sight deposit especially important. in environment historically low interest rates, deposit prove stable source finance recent years. this mean, however, situation remain stable future. be general level interest rate rise, fund could quickly flow elsewhere. bank therefore include assumption assessment management interest rate risk. furthermore, domestically focus bank exercise great caution residential mortgage lending. when determine apply lend criterion respect loan-to-value ratios, bank bear mind risk real estate market increased. moreover, assess affordability borrowers, bank aware mortgage rate rise rapidly. the application conservative lend criterion important, one hand, precautionary measure bank themselves, view prevail risk market. on other, prudent lend policy would help counter build-up imbalances. from financial stability perspective, event build-up risk swiss mortgage real estate markets, might prove necessary take regulatory measures. the snb, part, regularly ass whether adjustment countercyclical capital buff necessary. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: duration risk financial system speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, “the global borrower investor forum 2013 – euromoney conference”, london, 25 june 2013. * * * i wish thank gerhard rünstler, christoffer kok matthias sydow contribution remarks. i remain solely responsible opinion contain herein. lady gentlemen, it great pleasure euromoney conference. today i’d like consider impact volatile interest rate may financial system. let state quite clearly i intend drop hint change monetary policy stance euro area near future. a reversal would warrant current economic conditions. economic growth project remain weak year inflation expect remain clearly 2% euro area whole. the various non-standard measure introduce ecb support monetary policy transmission certain market segment stay place long necessary, measures, standard non-standard, deploy warranted. therefore, current juncture, doubt “exit” distant monetary policy remain accommodative. however, condition permanent; interest rate eventually increase, trigger tighten monetary policy stance, unwind global risk appetite, and/or external events. the recent bout volatility global fix income market excessive view current economic conditions, serve useful reminder development cannot dismiss lightly. in fact, since great depression number financial crisis occur prolong period exceptionally easy monetary conditions. some may remember event 1994, even gradual shift monetary policy low-rate period trigger severe turbulence bond markets. for unite states, concern raise recent speech federal reserve governor jeremy stein.1 he conclude sign fairly significant pattern “reaching-for-yield” behaviour u corporate credit markets. however, also comment leverage short-term finance credit remain modest therefore potential systemic harm would relatively limited. these development trigger several questions: first, channel low interest rate environment affect financial system’s exposure risk? second, sensitive balance sheet euro area financial institution duration risk? third, regulatory macroprudential policy design avoid negative implication rise interest rates? and role standard non-standard monetary policy mitigate unwarranted volatility along road? i structure remark along follow lines. first, i want review recent literature relationship monetary policy risk-taking behaviour financial institutions, so-called risk-taking channel monetary policy. second, i present evidence on-going search yield corporate bond markets. third, i also address specific challenge relate fragmentation euro area financial markets. fourth, i draw upon forward-looking solvency analysis result publish ecb’s recent financial stability review discus consequence 1 see stein, j. c., 2013, overheat credit markets: origins, measurement, policy responses, speech hold research symposium federal reserve bank st. louis, 7 february 2013. 2 bi central bankers’ speech various risk relate re-emergence risk aversion several market segments. finally, i discus policy implications. the risk-taking channel monetary policy one concern arise low interest rate environment associate search-for-yield may induce excessive risk-taking behaviour financial institutions. the recent crisis rekindle idea prolong lax monetary policy lead financial instability term “the risk-taking channel” monetary policy. there four broad argument i would like briefly discuss: asset substitution, search yield, pro-cyclical leverage, expectation monetary policy reaction.2  the asset substitution argument derive standard portfolio theory, hold low yield safe asset lead decrease weight bank portfolios. bank adjust portfolio risk-adjusted return risky safe investment equalised. this result low share safe assets.  a relate mechanism operate search yield. financial institution long-term commitment (such pension fund insurance companies) need match yield promise liability return assets. when interest rate high, generate necessary revenue invest safe assets. when rate low, force invest risky asset continue match yield liabilities.3  assume financial institution target constant perhaps even pro-cyclical leverage ratios. if monetary ease boost asset prices, bank equity increase bank respond fall leverage increase demand assets. this reaction reinforce initial boost asset values, on. the result “leverage channel” fragile bank system.4  finally, monetary policy could also affect risk-taking expectation strong policy response negative shocks. since 1990s, central bank repeatedly provide liquidity financial market follow market tensions. this channel sometimes call “greenspan put”. of course, object asymmetric pattern boom bust asset price prompt asymmetric monetary policy response. but remain true central bank liquidity provision, necessary crisis time, distort price signal therefore incentive financial market participants. financial player afford take ex ante extra risks, rely central bank mitigate consequence case risk materialise ex post. the bottom line four argument lax monetary policy potential reduce market price risk thereby trigger high degree risk-taking financial institutions. some recent empirical study ecb staff member lend support ideas.5,6 2 see, e.g., de nicolò g. et al., 2010, monetary policy bank risk taking, imf research department mimeo. 3 see rajan, r.g., 2005, ha financial development make world riskier? proceedings, federal reserve bank kansa city, august, 313–69. 4 see adrian t. shin h.j., 2009, money, liquidity. monetary policy, federal reserve bank new york staff report no 360. 5 one study use volatility index (vix) test dynamic link monetary policy, stock market volatility risk aversion. it find lax monetary policy decrease risk aversion stock market nine months. this effect persistent, last two years. moreover, monetary policy shock appear account significant proportion variation risk aversion. see hoerova m., bekaert g., lo duca m., 2013, risk, uncertainty monetary policy, journal monetary economics, forthcoming. bi central bankers’ speech 3 of course, certain circumstances, reduce market price risk free risk-taking capacity financial institution actually outcome desire monetary policy. consider, instance, various non-standard monetary policy undertake globally financial crisis break 2009. they design remove risk balance sheet avoid destructive fire sale time enable bank continue provide credit real economy take new risks. the concern is, however, persistent liquidity sow seed market turmoil. unexpected event shift monetary policy change economic growth prospect inevitably affect yield curve. since bank carry maturity transformation borrow short lend long, limit ability hedge interest rate risk, result could well abrupt unwind risk-taking positions, put financial market renew stress. these risk exacerbate fact bank operate asymmetric information limit liability tend take risk socially optimal, since internalise loss may eventually impose taxpayers. a clear consistent framework bank recovery resolution, include “bail-in” rule clear peck order limit exemptions, conducive strict monitor risk bank creditors. in fact, i mention before, many severe financial crisis since great depression break prolong period exceptionally easy monetary conditions. apart 2009 financial crisis, similar development occur relation burst new economy bubble 2001, collapse ltcm 1998, burst bond market bubble 1994. search yield bond market let turn current situation show evidence search yield euro area, take corporate bond market example. (chart 1) let start recent development european bond markets. since early 2012, see pronounce shift towards bond hold investment fund general decline yield across risk categories. a chart 1 shows, equity hold euro area investment fund slightly decline compare 2011, whereas net flow fix income fund increase substantially. (chart 2) a us, search yield corporate bond market euro area intensify recent months: corporate bond spread historical lows. chart 2 compare historical evolution yield high-yield bond default probabilities. yield generally back pre-crisis levels, default probability still significantly higher. one noticeable exception provide german corporate bonds, revert low default probabilities. the decline yield high-yield bond even remarkable supply bond shoot recently. total issuance euro area non-financial corporate debt 2012 60% high issuance 2011, remain strong first month year. the share high-yield debt total issuance rise one-quarter 2012 one-third first quarter 2013, average record 2006 2012. overall evidence euro area corporate bond parallel one u two market appear closely link other. a i discuss before, abrupt 6 another study find similar effect loans. low short-term interest rate soften credit standard household corporate loans, especially mortgages. this soften amplify securitisation activity weak supervision bank capital pronounce policy rate remain low prolong period. see maddaloni, a. peydró, j.-l., 2012, bank risk-taking, securitization low interest rates, ecb work paper no 1248. 4 bi central bankers’ speech unwind searches-for-yield – perhaps trigger highly leverage investor rush exit – would source concern financial stability. however, extent risk also depend degree maturity transformation stability funding. specific challenge euro area the unwind search-for-yield may emerge global phenomenon. however, specific issue relate current heterogeneity economic financial condition euro area. let focus government bond money markets. (chart 3) euro area government bond market appear resilient recently. the dispersion yield low first quarter 2013, volatility remain close 2009 (pre-sovereign debt crisis) levels. pivotal development reverse deteriorate trend confidence include ecb’s announcement outright monetary transaction (omt) programme european leaders’ commitment establish bank union, along noteworthy national developments, include recapitalisation restructure spanish bank sector. these positive developments, certainly room complacency. progress towards genuine economic monetary union confirm along line president van rompuy’s report, start clear predictable rule bank resolution establishment single resolution mechanism, complement single supervisory mechanism second pillar bank union. the continuation current low level government bond spread cannot take granted, country effort towards sustainable fiscal position thus continue unabated. a sudden re-pricing risk may lead increase spreads, despite on-going fiscal consolidation efforts, even country consolidation delayed.7 this would put renew pressure government revive fragmentation euro area bond markets. one possible strategy mitigate risk increase average maturity structure debt, best remedy cut quantity risk swiftly improve government solvency. money market also affect low rate environment, increase short term interest rate may ambiguous impact. since 2010, observe significant decline activity markets. trade volume overnight interbank loan continue decline 2012 low level historical standards, 60% pre-crisis levels. this may reflect continue fragmentation, also effect ecb liquidity operations, partly replace market activities. in principle, various reason assume rise policy rate would revive interbank market activity. first, low level interest rate may drive financial intermediaries, money market funds, market. second, institution without access deposit facility place fund eurosystem counterparties interest rate deposit facility rate. at current low rates, institution may try withdraw fund account custodian bank, thereby reduce supply fund potentially increase bank fund costs,. therefore rise policy rate may help revive money markets, bring back important financial intermediaries. at time, i argue before, high rate may negatively affect balance sheet position banks. if reintroduce asymmetric information interbank 7 this best understand one decompose risk premium price quantity risk. the quantity risk reflect country-specific economic fiscal situation. the price risk instead reflect general condition financial markets. even quantity risk remain constant, increase price risk may lead generalise increase spreads. see, e.g., manganelli, s wolswicjk, g, 2009, what drive spread euro area government bond market?, economic policy, 58: 191–240. bi central bankers’ speech 5 market adverse selection exclusion le reputable counterparties, current market fragmentation relatively low trade volume may persist even magnified. fund cost wholesale market may increase asymmetrically across euro area constituencies. here, best remedy restore full confidence bank balance sheet appropriate supervisory action. a quantitative assessment impact select macro-financial scenario let turn final part presentation look quantitative assessment various risk relate current low-interest-rate environment. these assessment base regular forward-looking solvency analysis conduct ecb. (chart 4): i would like discus result four scenario include current baseline scenario. the three alternative scenario relate possible return risk aversion rise interest rate various market segments: 1. a worsen sovereign debt crisis. this scenario assume permanent rise euro area long-term sovereign bond yield due low growth delay implementation fiscal structural reforms. the increase country specific range zero impact 370 basis point across countries. further effect entire yield curve asset prices, notably equities, take account. 2. fund stress scenario. this scenario assume emergence fund difficulty bank stress country would arise deposit outflow reduce access wholesale fund markets. this would imply high interbank customer loan rates. it would also induce bank restrain lend order comply loan-to-deposit ratio target - also light upcoming basel iii liquidity requirements. 3. increase risk aversion. this scenario investigate risk arise global unwind search yield. it assume abrupt increase investor risk aversion worldwide, result stock price decline mark increase corporate bond spreads, thereby raise interest rate risky market segments. this would trigger recession unite state negative implication global economic outlook. the detail scenario underlie methodology discuss detail late ecb financial stability review may 2013. just let say design account number transmission channel size shock base historical evidence. (chart 5) the scenario generate rich set results, let focus implication bank capital. under baseline scenario, core tier 1 capitalisation euro area large complex bank group would increase 11.2% fourth quarter 2012 11.3% end 2014. certainly, regard find adverse scenarios, crucially depend implementation detail individual scenarios. nevertheless, observe scenario configuration involve rise interest rate asset price decline would general tend exert negative influence banks’ solvency positions. this said, decline large complex bank group core tier 1 capital ratio adverse scenario find relatively mild, sign resilience among large euro area bank also reflect significant capital raise effort recent years. specifically, average core tier 1 capital ratio would decline 0.4 percentage point fund stress scenario, 0.6 sovereign debt crisis scenario 1.1 global risk aversion scenario. however, average number mask dispersion across euro area countries. 6 bi central bankers’ speech this analysis focus bank sector. the situation euro area insurance sector differ somewhat. insurance company also extent expose risk shift sovereign bond yield global risk aversion. forward-looking analysis asset liability euro area insurance sector indicate impact risk would remain limit due comfortable capital buffers. for euro area insurance sector, low yield highly rat government bond constitute solvency risk medium term. this hold particular jurisdiction market-consistent approach treatment liability pursued. in case, balance sheet squeeze low profitability assets, also high value liabilities. although currently limit euro area countries, liability effect gain importance eve introduction solvency ii regime. conclusion lesson policy let conclude. monetary policy support economic recovery avoid another build-up excessive financial imbalances, trade-off two objectives. the monetary policy stance ecb remain accommodative long needed, look open mind standard non-standard monetary policy tool warrant outlook price stability. in particular, ensure effective monetary policy stance, measured, among indicator also term structure money market rates, remain align govern council’s assessment, outlook price stability. the financial system however able operate different constellation yields. the current period low interest rate use prepare it. a number action needed, cut across policy domain many case take time bear results. they high policy agenda. let highlight three them, monetary policy cannot substitute. first, bank capital liquidity buff sufficient withstand normalisation yield market segments. in europe, achieve within framework bank union. before start single supervisory mechanism, ecb national supervisory agency conduct balance sheet assessment provide health check euro area banks, adequate peer review draw necessary third-party expertise. a comprehensive stress test exercise launch cooperation european bank authority cover wide range scenarios. prior exercises, credible backstop facility need place address potential capital shortfall banks’ balance sheets. second, regulatory measure aim curtail excessive bank leverage, mitigate duration risk avoid excessive maturity transformation need complement capital adequacy rules. both leverage ratio net stable fund ratio (nfsr) basel iii still review, leverage ratio disclose 2015 basel committee

thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 bi central bankers’ speech 1 william c dudley: why financial stability necessary prerequisite effective monetary policy remark mr william c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york chairman committee global financial system (cgfs), andrew crockett memorial lecture, bank international settlement 2013 annual general meeting, basel, 23 june 2013. * * * this panel entitle monetary policy banking.1 that take lot territory. rather try cover waterfront, i go start single premise: financial stability necessary prerequisite effective monetary policy. there critical chain linkage monetary policy bank onwards real economy. financial stability necessary condition linkage operate effectively. thus, necessary condition monetary policy able achieve economic objectives. i outline briefly i see major implication stem premise. these include central bank major role play ensure financial stability evaluate stance monetary policy light problem financial system may impair monetary policy transmission mechanism.2 in mind, big lesson financial crisis monetary policy cannot work properly financial instability. when financial instability occurs, disturb market function also impair bank balance sheets. the result disruption financial intermediation function result constraint availability credit household businesses. this, turn, lead reduction aggregate demand put additional stress weaken financial system. obviously, favorable dynamic. financial instability impact conduct monetary policy via three major channels. first, financial instability generate sufficiently large shock aggregate demand central bank may encounter zero low bind constraint – constraint monetary policy instrument, example, federal fund rate – cannot easily push zero. in circumstances, may easy fully offset shock pursuit stimulative monetary policy. at zero bound, central bank powerless, may turn monetary policy tool forward guidance large scale asset purchases. but tool may effective low short-term rate instrument. in particular, central bank may will use nonconventional tool full extent necessary provide degree stimulus would provide could set interest rate negative levels. that might uncertainty nonconventional tool work potential cost associate use tool term market function risk future financial instability. second, financial instability impair linkage monetary policy financial conditions. the central bank may move much accommodative monetary policy stance, may lead much improvement financial conditions. we see clearly spread risk premia period financial stress. depletion capital bank system interaction friction market failure may also lead constraint availability credit follow financial shock. a recent u.s. example second issue, household low fico score difficulty refinance 1 krishna guha, marc saidenberg others staff contribute remarks. 2 a always, i say today reflect view necessarily fomc federal reserve system. 2 bi central bankers’ speech mortgage obtain new mortgage purchase home. this stem worry lender put back risk – mortgage might put back fannie mae freddie mac mortgage become nonperforming. for give reduction mortgage rate relative normal levels, reduce support house sector consumption. thus, another lesson crisis monetary policymakers need attune condition financial system influence monetary policy change affect financial conditions. third, linkage financial condition aggregate demand may also impaired. for example, asset bubble cause buildup debt need reduce significantly, low interest rate ease financial condition may stimulate aggregate demand much. separately, protract zero bind episode, monetary policy impulse may become attenuate time. low interest rate may make financial condition easier, lift wealth, encourage household shift spend future present. but future arrives, spend may low consequence. the linkage financial condition economic activity may vary depend long accommodative monetary policy regime place. so implication stem fact financial instability impair efficacy monetary policy? i think least three major implications:  the central bank strong stake prevent financial instability.  when financial instability occurs, central bank important role take step mitigate financial instability. this include ensure credible liquidity backstop available force bank strengthen themselves, instance raise additional capital.  the stance monetary policy need judge light well transmission channel monetary policy operating. when financial instability disrupt monetary policy transmission channels, follow simple rule base long-term historical relationship lead inappropriately tight monetary policy. let consider implication turn. the first implication, central bank strong stake prevent financial instability, several elements. the central bank need will respond limit financial market bubble develop first place. this include pay attention asset price bubbles, also relate excess leverage short-term fund markets. a i note speech year ago, difficult practice.3 after all, bubble difficult identify real time central bank’s policy toolkit deal bubble may limited. however, difficulty cannot excuse inaction. use bully pulpit, implement macroprudential measures, adjust monetary policy generate superior result compare inaction. the central bank also ensure financial system sufficiently robust resilient financial market shocks, bank system absorb shock continue perform credit intermediation function. this many element include tough capital liquidity requirement bank strong financial market infrastructures. it also include take action eliminate source vulnerability whenever may arise – example, strengthen triparty repo system, reduce vulnerability money market mutual fund runs, force derivative contract standardize centrally cleared. these action undertake “peacetime” rather crisis already underway. finally, central bank need look horizon identify market practice process could make financial system vulnerable shock could 3 see “asset bubble implication central bank policy”, economic club new york, april 7, 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 3 amplify shocks. a example, tough response poor mortgage underwrite practice evident u.s. house bubble would appropriate opinion. or attention bank compensation practice could mitigate incentive excessive risk-taking. the second implication financial instability occur, central bank need respond forcefully mitigate instability. this include ensure appropriate liquidity backstop available. this necessary order reassure counterparties solvent institution access liquidity repay obligation regardless degree illiquidity stress financial system. a saw fall 2008, without appropriate backstops, market seize completely even counterparties perceive solvent. that market participant tend hoard liquidity time stress counterparties may engage one another uncertain whether others so. central bank liquidity backstop act coordinate device, solve collective action problem face private market participants. however, serious stress episodes, credible liquidity backstop alone always prove sufficient. it also necessary take step restore bank system health soon possible. this mean force bank cut capital distribution early raise new capital timely way even capital-raising result force dilution exist shareholders. with respect bank capital, saw two unwelcome behavior crisis central bank bank regulator need lean against. bank reluctant cut capital distribution worry would signal weakness. of course, capital distribution make bank bank system weaker. also, saw bank reluctant raise capital guard particularly bad state world think might unnecessarily dilute shareholder bad state world materialize. of course, collective action bank raise additional capital make bank system weak would otherwise been. this turn make possibility particularly bad state world likely. in circumstance – u.s. face 2009 arguably eurozone face today – essential authority force sufficient capital system. the subtlety time stress necessary overcapitalize bank system relative base case scenario order ensure financial stability ongoing supply credit real economy stress scenario. do make bad scenario le likely materialize improvement credit supply help engineer strong recovery would otherwise materialize.4 the third implication stance monetary policy need assess base state financial system real economy. how monetary policy impulse transmit real economy immutable change depend monetary policy affect financial condition financial condition affect economic activity. during follow financial crises, problem financial system impair transmission monetary policy real economy. when happens, policy may need accommodative otherwise order achieve objectives. the experience japan unite state case point.5 in retrospect, know follow collapse property bubble investment boom japan 1990s, bank japan (boj) follow sufficiently accommodative monetary policy 4 ideally, case u.s. 2009, authority require bank meet stress scenario capital ratio standard add equity capital, credit give reduce assets. this lean incentive deleverage meet high capital ratio requirements. 5 see recent speech “lessons zero bound: the japanese u.s. experience”, japan society, may 21, 2013. 4 bi central bankers’ speech prevent deflation. although boj response appropriate relative economic forecast prevail time, forecast prove much optimistic. thus, policy insufficiently accommodative benefit hindsight. to less degree, critique also apply unite states. despite aggressive shift towards great monetary policy accommodation 2008 2009, ongoing subsequent ease – support return growth help facilitate need adjustment house household balance sheet – economic recovery consistently weak forecast. a result, federal reserve fall short meet employment inflation objectives. this suggest benefit hindsight, u.s. monetary policy, though aggressive historic standards, sufficiently accommodative relative state economy. in regard, i would caution mechanical use monetary policy rule follow financial crisis. in unite states, so-called taylor rule receive considerable attention guide policy. but number reason believe use mechanically would result tight monetary policy setting. while discuss shortcoming taylor rule beyond scope remark today, let make one simple point. if transmission channel monetary policy impaired, equilibrium real rate associate monetary policy neutrality likely considerably low 2.25 percent real rate assumption embody typical taylor rule formulation. monetary policy need take onboard, even consider issue risk-management zero bound. i argue today central bank need major role ensure financial system sound. without this, central bank cannot ensure monetary policy effective achieve objectives. this important linkage monetary policy banking. now express concern involvement bank regulation supervision may lead central bank bias set monetary policy try help trouble bank institutions. this fear misplaced. problem financial sector take account monetary policy purpose extent affect transmission policy real economy. there separate tool kit address problem level bank themselves. others argue central bank involve oversight regulation financial system put much power hand one authority. another concern consolidation responsibility dangerous central bank could threaten central bank’s independence respect monetary policy. i think legitimate issues. but big risks, view, monetary policy fail accomplish economic objective financial instability, difficulty stem inevitably imperfect coordination take place multiple agency divide responsibility crisis. in cases, central bank bad outcome result negative consequence ongoing credibility effectiveness, also economic consequence severe citizens. to address concern central bank power, best approach ensure accountability. this mean appropriate oversight legislature ongoing transparency central bank motivation actions, reasonably expect accomplish, honest assessment success failures. thank much kind attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stephen s poloz: reconstruction – rebuild business confidence canada remark mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, oakville chamber commerce, burlington, ontario, 19 june 2013. * * * introduction thank introduction come today. it pleasure deliver first public speech governor bank canada heart southern ontario, especially since road hometown oshawa. this region historic centre canadian industry commerce. it home canada’s storied business prestigious centre learning. many firm make region canada strong front line global financial crisis push canadian economy recession. a economy continue expand, performance business sector across canada come watch great interest. that’s happen business canada matter bank canada. not care – which, let assure you, do. but order u job properly, order u promote economic financial welfare canadians, need understand dynamic fee canadian economy. the bank aim keep inflation low, stable predictable. our flexible inflation-targeting framework best contribution monetary policy make canadian household business make decision financial future confidence. over past couple decades, average rate inflation close 2 per cent target. even global economic financial crisis, commitment waver. the inflation target sacrosanct u become credible anchor inflation expectation canadians. moreover, target symmetrical: care much inflation fall rise target. when inflation fall target interest rate correspondingly low, little room conventional monetary policy respond negative shocks. when inflation target, erosion purchase power become significant uncertainty future price make hard household business make good financial decisions. further, framework built-in flexibility respect amount time take return inflation target shock. year successful inflation target give bank credibility use flexibility period economic stress. a flexible exchange rate also key achieve inflation target time. the recent turmoil show u value credibility earned. like others, address stress crisis, put flexibility regime work. nonetheless, throughout recession since, inflation expectation canadian remain well anchor target, prove framework secure working. this past downturn different previous recessions. even though canada perform good g-7 peers, great recession put many company business, especially small export firms. many survive dramatically reduce operations, shutter plant dismantle equipment. these action hurt – badly – term job loss lose output. while recover – fact, surpass pre-recession peak – structural damage cause 2 bi central bankers’ speech crisis lingers. indeed, recovery primarily drive high household spending, export lag behind. rather recovery usual sense, look like postwar reconstruction. or, allow slide academic language moment refer schumpeterian process “creative destruction,” we’ve certainly destruction. but creation side equation delay numerous unusual risks, heighten uncertainty, lack confidence. this i want talk today. i want discus impact crisis canadian business firm survive change responding. we need business confidence continue heal. this matter much bank canada. our understand issue part rigorous distillation information drive policy decisions. a part process, meet, talk, argue best understand significant force drive economy. with next policy decision 17 july, early stage round. standard macroeconomic model go far capture today’s dynamics, especially uncertainty great normal, important supplement model insight directly business. my message today relevant company across canada, resonate particularly region. a native oshawa, i understand well. i see impact crisis recession auto sector hometown. i hear manufacturer exporter region. and bank hear financial community bay street type business leader southern ontario participate bank’s quarterly business outlook surveys. bad recession since depression i probably don’t need tell anyone room recent global recession bad downturn experience since great depression. in short order, global gdp fell 3 per cent million upon million job lost. in canada, 432,000 job lose gdp fell 4.2 per cent. the unemployment rate spike 8.7 per cent. the severity global economic financial crisis deliver direct, sharp blow canadian business. canada experience particularly deep contraction investment exports. the trauma severe long-lasting. it impact felt business across country, business saw market dwindle balance sheet deteriorate. in downturn lasts, say, nine months, bank likely let client ride recession. but prolong crisis, story complex. credit become tough find. anecdotally, know otherwise solvent creditworthy firm leave considerably le credit needed. in many cases, temporary plant shutdown sufficient match fall demand decline financing. some firm reduce operations. others simply close doors. let’s look facts. during normal growth period canada, steady increase number business operation. in short, creative destruction result net creation new firms. but since onset recession, limit net creation businesses. canada’s exporter particularly hard hit. the group profoundly affect manufacture exporters, whose rank continue shrink. canada alone regard. in unite states, dynamic similar even dramatic. the net number new establishment fell three year row 2011, when, finally, trend turn around. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the reconstruction challenge perhaps surprise, then, give decline global demand, drop number american company trade with, relate drop number canadian exporters, canada’s export sector lagged. it component canada’s gdp remain pre-recession peak. our annual export $100 billion low would typical point recovery cycle. regain lose output company disappear downsize require exist firm boost production, invest expand capacity, net creation new firm resume high growth path. the good news balance sheet corporate canada healthy capacity invest exists. we could see recession cause significant structural change canadian economy time. the bank acknowledge destruction potential happen quarterly monetary policy report april 2009. reflect best judgment, bank reduce estimate potential output growth year 2009 2011. nonetheless, relatively fortunate canada. in immediate aftermath crisis, stimulative monetary fiscal policy prove highly effective maintain domestic demand, particularly household expenditures. household spend support strong growth borrowing, result record-high debt-to-income levels. give circumstances, good thing household capacity expand spend – provide necessary cushion bad effect global contraction. the bank careful remind people interest rate rise point. we urge homeowner borrower arithmetic ensure able manage debt normal interest rates. i confident exactly people doing. this growth model effective, limit clear. in fact, recent data choppy, continue see constructive evolution activity house sector. what need happen next export momentum build business investment recover household sector settle balance sustainable growth path. for happen require rebuild canada’s economic potential. that make recovery cycle unique. automotive sector let use case study illustrate this. the structural transformation auto sector dramatic. the 70-per cent decline production peak trough brutal. machinery box send overseas. plant closed. these hard time sector make live it. the crisis auto sector prompt federal government step extraordinary financial support. that support help save thousand job throughout southern ontario. the firm survive low cost structures. we see innovative process accelerate new product development. these element improve competitiveness canadian firm position well go head-to-head u.s. global parts-sector firms. they also help canada gain foothold global supply chains. the recovery auto sale unite state clearly way – first essential ingredient. but remain see reconstruction process i’ve discuss today play important sector. 4 bi central bankers’ speech forestry i could tell similar story canada’s forestry sector, – like auto sector – much small before. in 2012, canadian forestry industry account 1.2 per cent total gdp, around 1.6 per cent 2007. during period, almost 60,000 worker – 20 per cent forestry workforce – displaced. here, too, recovery u.s. house build new relationship fast-growing markets, china, contribute improve confidence. i could describe similar story sector include ict (information communication technology) biotechnology. these story need keep watching. what business tell u from frequent conversation bank business leaders, know entrepreneurial spirit alive well canada. some decline export reflect ingenuity canadian firms, include firm region, respond u.s. slowdown pivot product market faster-growing segment canadian economy. others become competitive restructure find niche adjacent traditional market. such insight fee importantly bank’s understand work canadian economy, thus policy deliberation bank – i strongly believe that, especially unusual times, work understand undercurrent recovery, kind dialogue private sector critical. confidence to realize economic growth canada look – return self-sustaining, self-generating growth – need see rebuild capacity, expansion exist company creation new ones. this require grow confidence among exist business entrepreneurs. the gather momentum foreign demand, especially unite states, help lift confidence canada’s exporters. this critical canadian firm boost investment expand productive capacity. the sequence anticipate following: foreign demand build; export strengthen further; confidence improve; exist company expand; company invest increase capacity; new one created. this sequence may already underway. conclusion to conclude: in monetary policy, action critically important. the bank absolutely committed, i mention earlier, keep inflation predictable, stable target firm make longer-term decision environment confidence. but words, too, matter great deal. by explain cross-currents work economy, projection what’s ahead, monetary policy response, help heal business confidence. and order expand understand what’s happen real economy, listen businesses, labour group industry associations. beneath economic financial statistic analysis real people, make real decisions. those decision hard make time, uncertainty high confidence low, even difficult. i optimistic sign process way. right now, need stability patience. bi central bankers’ speech 5 to help nurture confidence, active engagement canadian must remain cornerstone policy bank canada. so thank today. i’m keen hear views, i would please take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 deepak mohanty: impact euro area crisis south asia paper mr deepak mohanty, executive director reserve bank india, present saarcfinance group meeting, islamabad, 18 june 2013. * * * the assistance provide dr. mohua roy mr. somnath sharma gratefully acknowledged. the global financial crisis

flow india. conclusion the uncertainty duration euro area crisis persist much improvement real economy despite string policy steps. while reform initiated, fresh concern surfacing: example, recent downgrade italy france. in india, proactive address challenge pose uncertainty global economy, particularly euro area. a capital inflow economy turn volatile, finance large current account deficit become challenge. in context, various policy measure undertake reserve bank government moderate import improve capital inflows. oil gold two major item imports. with regard oil, domestic price increasingly make market determined. it expect help economize domestic oil consumption. recently import duty gold raise bank finance pledge gold restricted. the efficacy measures, however, yet tested. we also introduce inflation index bond help contain gold demand extent bond use investment hedge inflation. notwithstanding measure fast grow economy like ours, import demand bind high. hence, step export narrow trade gap. but phase sluggish global economy, difficult push exports. nevertheless, initiative take diversify trade towards emerge markets. on balance, however, current account deficit remain high thus need finance capital inflows. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the policy measure take encourage capital inflow include liberalisation interest rate non-resident deposit external commercial borrowings, rationalisation norm relate foreign institutional investment (fii) infrastructure debt allow foreign direct investment (fdi) multi-brand retail. the sectoral limit fii

tomorrow – great mekong subregion keynote address dr prasarn trairatvorakul, governor bank thailand, euromoney great mekong subregion investment forum, bangkok, 13 june 2013. * * * excellencies, honorable speakers, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 1. it great pleasure euromoney great mekong subregion (gms) investment forum honour give remark topic ‘financing tomorrow: the gms’. a year ago, i opportunity talk topic once. at time, i share think role thai financial intermediary ‘connector’ bridge global financial player small local institutions. 2. this year, gather time gm undergo tremendous economic reforms. member country transition towards high degree openness integrate global economic mainstreams. the gm economy grow fast rate world since early 1990s, average close 8%, despite gloom recent global financial crisis. this transformation contribute economic convergence narrow development divide within region. the gap income difference gm rest asian country neighbourhood reduce continuously. 3. with promise economic potential ahead us, i would like reemphasize share vision “what shall expect see future great mekong subregion” “how achieve prosperity.” 4. i picture great mekong subregion (gms) next twenty year much connect integrate region: region connect solely river, various mode transportation, one travel conveniently, trade investment flow across efficiently, prosperity widely enjoy even rural areas. although yet there, i strongly believe vision come true. 5. we always hear say “rome build day”. thus, start work together towards share vision start today. there great deal preparatory work done; view, crucial task infrastructure development business access funds. the first task channel intraregional fund infrastructure projects, follow second task promote economic growth equality within region enhance financial market support private financing. lady gentlemen, 6. let highlight key issue first preparatory work, finance infrastructure development. the adb already commit least 9 billion u dollars1 fund gm development project pipeline. besides, also estimate roughly 8 trillion u dollars2 require meet infrastructure need asia next decade. although amount daunting, i believe fulfilled, give current global capital surge fact asian saver put away around 7 trillion u 1 2012, adb website (http://www.adb.org/countries/gms/news-releases) 2 http://www.adbi.org/files/2009.08.31.book.infrastructure.seamless.asia.pdf pp.181 2 bi central bankers’ speech dollars3 year. like direct flow flood right river become benefit live area, overflow capital harness benefit need long-term projects. 7. to meet region’s finance requirements, look new mean attract funding. firstly, promote private sector participation infrastructure development public-private partnership (ppp). the ppp model improve efficiency long-term project adopt private sector’s expertise reduce burden government budget. although ppp model long discussed, implementation model still trial-and-error practice. regardless, i believe clear governance suitable regulatory framework, ppp could promote private sector’s participation bring untapped resources. secondly, customize innovative financial instruments. this call inter-agency collaborative effort introduce innovative financial instrument link specific fund requirement market preferences. to name few, thailand recently launch first infrastructure fund finance sky train extension. on international scale, financial cooperation initiatives, asean infrastructure fund (aif) would also complement domestic endeavor channel intraregional save need projects. 8. this lead second preparatory work, improve supportive framework private financing. the mekong river make small tributary flow towards end form large fertile river. the benefit receive confluence small tributary oppose one waterway incomparable. likewise, strengthen domestic capital market would help allocate available save productive use, thus, facilitate real sector’s economic activity support economic growth. 9. a deep liquid financial market could reduce business over-reliance bank finance channel. on hand, could also serve less-expensive alternative source fund local entities. the initial step stone towards well-developed financial market improve cross-country interconnectedness local financial markets. financial connectivity could enhance link capital bond markets, create regional exchange trade system, well develop network payment settlement system. another important step streamline rule regulation facilitate cross-border movement capital. such process achieve promote flow capital among member country via reduce regulatory obstacle stimulate foreign participation outward investment. currently, thailand allow non-residents asean issue foreign currency-denominated local currency bonds. the derivative market also serf investor hedge financial risks. in addition, regional financial cooperation credit guarantee investment facility (cgif) asian bond market initiative (abmi) could also help support development local bond markets. 10. to sum remarks, process strengthen financial market enhance capacity absorb large long-term development project long-drawn process commitment public sector alone cannot guarantee success. of course, public sector must fulfill integral role create supportive regulatory framework distribute public good economic benefit enjoy share social participant whole range income spectrum. 3 gross national save 2012 32 asian country approximately 7.14 usd trillion (countries use calculation include china, japan, south korea, singapore, thailand, indonesia, malaysia others) imf source; weo bi central bankers’ speech 3 however, private entity must collaborate public sector step bridge current finance gap take part structural reform process. lady gentlemen, 11. in light historical background, we, part gm community, share long-lasting prosperity throughout mekong river areas. look ahead, future need commitment unite aspiration u move forward together cohesive region. the opportunity ahead apparent, transform member countries’ strength regional competitiveness, opportunity multiplied. by take conference today platform share common vision, i believe initial important step shall lead region towards sustainable inclusive potentials. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: the european central bank’s role overcome crisis speech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, unicredit business dialogue, hamburg, 17 june 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, many thank invitation business dialogue. when i last give speech hamburg – almost exactly two year ago – i also focus overcome crisis. though crisis indeed yet, much certainly happen meantime: • powerful set instrument overcome crisis; • economic governance framework european level reinforced; • path towards bank union break negative feedback loop bank sovereign debtors. the organiser ask address ecb’s role context i’m happy honour request. but let make quite clear start: ecb explicit mandate. our task ensure price stability euro area, non-standard measure contribute objective. but monetary policy cannot call overcome crisis. a sustainable resolution crisis lie hand member states. so even i would like look two questions: • first, role monetary policy overcome crisis? • second, euro area government live responsibility eliminate cause crisis? let begin role ecb. the ecb’s core task ensure price stability. that changed, change. we clear mandate, confer u member states’ government supra-national level european treaties. it virtually cast stone. at time, operational leeway choose fulfil mandate – provide stay within limits. during crisis emerge that, places, transmission monetary policy signal real economy restrict uneven. in central bank speak distort monetary transmission mechanism. we therefore take non-standard measure monetary policy would effectively pass finance condition real economy. these non-standard measure complement traditional set instruments. put simply: interest rate decision aim price stability. the non-standard measure seek ensure desire effect decision also spread across entire euro area. one non-standard measure policy full allotment refinance operation appropriate collateral. we also extend maturity refinance operation three year expand collateral framework. these measure gear towards banks‘ refinance conditions, turn make easy credit institution provide sufficient credit economy favourable terms. last summer decide far-reaching measure – notably announcement outright monetary transactions. prior announcement, observe market 2 bi central bankers’ speech finance condition increasingly characterise fear among market participant member state would revert back national currencies. the market hence price conversion risk premium. owe part premium, refinance condition many commercial bank – thereby real economy – deteriorate dramatically. the ecb’s monetary policy commit maintain price stability euro area whole. so take measure would ensure single monetary policy would take effect member states. since summer last year, finance condition real economy euro area clearly improved. the situation clearly return normal. that also felt savers, pension fund insurance company germany: yield german government bond increased, previously extremely low investor panic reshuffle portfolio favour supposedly safe havens. these yield even turn negative times. the distortion monetary transmission mechanism thus visibly receded. at time, influence monetary policy return save overestimated. for one, real return primarily fee save economy. in long term, real return mainly define production potential. by adjust interest rate, monetary policy serf smoothen development order prevent economy overheating, cause acceleration inflation – crisis, say – enter deflationary spiral. second, monetary policy behave neutrally towards different save instruments. it give preference save investment equity fix income securities, gain considerably value germany past months. all non-standard measure temporary. for short time, overly ample provision central bank liquidity bank sector incompatible mandate maintain purchase power. we adjust interest rate operation time. and excessive liquidity automatically returned: bank demand le liquidity soon monetary transmission mechanism improves. this process full swing. the three-year longer-term refinance operation i refer expire begin 2015. many bank have, however, already repay fund borrowed. so design non-standard measure special withdrawal strategy required. at time, aware long-term risk stability associate extremely low rate excessive liquidity long period. it hence imperative repair effort area carry resolutely thoroughly. the ecb indeed make important contribution crisis management cannot resolve crisis monetary means. in end, win time policy sector carry necessary adjustment reforms. it government member state live responsibility. they need remedy remain deficiency european governance framework. and must gear economic policy demand economic monetary union. important step take since outset crisis. the member state must single-mindedly continue path towards new robust political economy. the first step take establishment effective set instrument management resolution crisis euro area. initially, crisis-related measure member state international monetary fund (imf) arrange ad hoc. since october last year, european stability mechanism (esm) replace european financial stability facility (efsf) design temporary measure. the esm organisation structure intergovernmental body. with view progressive deepen european integration, development truly bi central bankers’ speech 3 federal institution would certainly appropriate question ecb’s mandate. the new measure take european level prove effective counter contagion euro area serious stage crisis. financial market consumer gain renew confidence euro area, even though prospect growth employment remain weak medium term. combine financial assistance strict condition bring negative economic trend programme country halt. the economic downturn strongly affect country may even bottom near future. what crucial ensure programme country stray path essential fiscal, financial structural adjustment. the second step undertake strengthen framework steer economic policy european level. it aim prevent dangerous imbalance public budget current account effectively future. the govern council ecb urge time economic governance euro area improved, call stability growth pact strengthened, procedure put place counter macroeconomic imbalance ceiling public debt deficit set stability growth pact transpose national legislation member states. we welcome regulatory framework reform accordingly. however, regulatory framework alone cannot ensure economic policy sound. paper doesn’t blush, clearly evidence failure original stability growth pact. the new governance framework successful implement consistently, accord letter spirit agreed. it success thus depend action take european commission council ministers. all confirm take brief look current “european semester”, new process coordination economic policy european union. i fear unsound economic policy member state oppose decisively enough. the rule new european governance framework effective strictly applied. in particular, deadline correction excessive budget deficit should, instance, extended, way exception, event exceedingly adverse circumstances. extension become rule. the third set measure find first step undertake towards bank union. the measure aimed, particular, disrupt negative feedback loop bank public sector debtors, halt increase fragmentation european financial markets. all bank euro area, well credit institution member state arrange close cooperation ecb, subject european supervision, “single supervisory mechanism”. although ecb responsible direct supervision large, systemically important credit institutions, mean bank cover ecb’s supervisory framework. national supervisory authority comply regulations, guideline instruction ecb. moreover, ecb able time take direct supervision small credit institutions. current plan envisage common supervision commence second half next year. however, common bank supervision one element true bank union. in parallel, also need common resolution mechanism. the two element somewhat like siamese twin – one cannot survive without other. their combination way negative feedback loop bank sector public budget disrupted. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the detail design “single resolution mechanism” still subject debate brussels member states’ capital cities. without prejudice decision thereon, i would like highlight two element i regard particularly important design single resolution mechanism: one hand, geographical institutional scope applicability single resolution mechanism single supervisory mechanism. a european resolution authority would ensure decision take timely objective manner. a network national authority would fall short necessary respect. case bank find precarious situation call swift efficient action. a european resolution authority would able avoid unnecessary delay overcome coordination-related constraints. that would also keep resolution cost low. on hand, use taxpayers’ money limit exceptional cases. the first step use equity bail-ins shareholder creditor great extent possible. the next step tap european resolution fund finance bank contributions. public fund european stability mechanism (esm) use temporarily emergencies. such temporary assistance cover subsequent levy banks, ultimately fiscal policy impact. the european commission submit draft legislation common resolution mechanism end month. thereafter, member state need ensure establish effective resolution mechanism addition common supervision. that bring back i start speech today: member state responsible find last solution crisis. what central bank ensure transmission monetary policy function properly again. the instrument need disposal. however, hand tie disruption socio-economic transmission mechanism concerned. return realistic view make election promise explain implement unpopular measure wherever necessary prerogative responsibility – national – political domain. werner schneyder, austrian political satirist, say europe consist country want rule decided. that must change. only possible sustainably resolve crisis. bi central bankers’ speech 1 manuel sánchez: mexico weak global environment remark mr manuel sánchez, deputy governor bank mexico, morgan stanley’s mexico’s moment investor conference, mexico city, 17 june 2013. * * * it privilege participate conference dedicate examine investment opportunity mexican economy. i appreciate morgan stanley’s invitation share think economic situation outlook mexico. my remark divide three parts. first, i briefly review status mexican economy current context global economic softness; second, i analyze recent development mexican financial market connection monetary policy develop countries; third, i describe challenge monetary policy inflation mexico. development mexican economy mexico’s economic performance year limit weakness world economy. on one hand, unite state show sign recovery, confirm indicator relate personal consumption, house sector, lending, labor market. yet, growth dampen contraction public spending, reflect fiscal consolidation efforts, well recently low contribution net exports. forward-looking indicator reveal economic activity unite state may continue strengthen. so far year, analysts’ consensus forecast posit gdp expansion high 2014 year. however, expect growth still insufficient u.s. economy return secular trend, something continue challenge current economic policy. on hand, euro zone remain recession, despite progress financial stability. in addition, emerge economy appear slowing, show performance industrial production exports. even pmis manufacture service sector imply expansion economy continue, indicator exhibit decline trend. in short, global growth forecast 2013 revise slightly downward, 2014 unchanged, remain average rate see crisis.1 so far 2013, mexico’s economic output continue upturn begin four year ago, although slow pace. moderation global economic activity indicator (igae) stem stagnation industry contraction agriculture, latter largely result march frosts. the lack strength manufacture reflect weakness sector’s exports, direct unite state especially markets. in contrast, service sector remain highly dynamic. lend private sector, particular consumer lending, keep growing, albeit low rates. additionally, number formally employ worker continue increase, unemployment rate remain somewhat historic average. 1 consensus forecast u.s. gdp growth 1.9 2.7 percent 2013 2014, respectively. the world economic growth forecast 2013 drop 2.6 2.5 percent january june 2013, estimate 2014 remain 3.2 percent period. see consensus economics (2013), consensus forecasts, january june. 2 bi central bankers’ speech some indicator imply low external demand likely negative repercussion domestic spending. retail sale lose momentum gross fix investment recently slowed. nevertheless, prospective indicators, include manufacture non-manufacturing pmis lead indicators, still suggest economic performance may improve. consistently, analyst revise forecast mexican gdp growth downward current year but, general, keep forecast 2014.2 even though downside risk near-term growth forecast appear increase year, next year upside risk may remain. in particular, recovery u.s. manufacture consolidate follow months, upswing could fuel manufacture mexico, favorable effect sector economy. in medium term, economic expansion mexico continue depend productivity growth, lack big drag income improvement. progress nation’s structural reform agenda encouraging, include change affect labor market, government accounting, education, competition telecommunications. finally, approval financial reform initiative submit recently congress could yield additional benefits. capital inflow financial market during last three years, emerge market saw significant capital inflows, appear accelerate first four month 2013. in mexico, large proportion flow go peso-denominated government bonds. the relative abundance external fund emerge market seem reflect three fundamental factors. first, loose monetary policy develop nations, case unite state imply policy interest rate cut near zero significant quantitative easing, trigger search high yields. second completely unrelated precede factor, global risk aversion remain relatively tame since 2010. third, individual characteristic different country contribute explain capital inflow equal emerge economies. in particular, mexico’s attractiveness could involve factor openness capital account, free-floating exchange rate regime, certainty discretionary intervention markets, moderate country risk, positive prospect structural reforms.3 during last weeks, sentiment change global financial markets. favorable u.s. economic data various federal reserve officials’ statement fuel market analysts’ expectation imminent start taper quantitative ease unite states. hence, april employment report publish may approximately coincide begin rise trend long-term government bond rate unite state nations. at time, u.s. dollar appreciate respect many currencies. 2 economic growth expectation mexico 2013 drop 3.6 3.0 percent january may 2013, 2014 remain 4.0 percent period. see banco de méxico (2013), survey private-sector economic analysts’ expectations, may. 3 two empirical analysis factor explain capital flows, include idiosyncratic factors, ghosh, a.r., et al. (2012), “surges,” imf work paper, wp/12/22, january; fratzscher, m. (2011), “capital flows, push versus pull factor global financial crisis,” ecb work paper series, no. 1364, july. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the result volatility global financial market bring considerable increase mexican government bond yields. for maturities, upward shift yield curve offset downward shift see first four month year. like emerging-market currencies, peso depreciate dollar. adjustment mexico’s financial market occur orderly way. fx market volume continue high, bid-ask spread remain slim, foreign hold peso-denominated bond still near record highs, although portfolio duration decline throughout year. recent global financial volatility foretaste could happen process u.s. monetary policy unwind begin earnest. hence, likely turbulence may continue. give scenario, mexican economy expect confront new episode uncertainty solid manner. however, important creditor well debtor remain wary fx interest-rate risk exposures. at time, authority need remain vigilant order ensure financial market operate normally times. inflation monetary policy in last decade, monetary policy mexico seek convergence inflation toward 3 percent permanent target. progress price stability time considerable. nevertheless, current year, inflation post somewhat high levels, since march surpass bank mexico’s upper limit variability interval plus minus one percentage point around inflation target. high inflation mainly reflect pressure noncore component cpi, agricultural price well energy price government tariffs. however, negative supply shock expect transitory. at time, moderation core inflation continue depend, degree, positive shock certain service prices. nevertheless, core inflation remain around 3 percent last month expect stay around level rest year next. up now, evidence secondary effect recent change relative prices. analysts’ short-term inflation expectation increase somewhat, expectation medium long term remain stable, albeit 3 percent. the bank mexico expect inflation return variability interval second half year, close permanent target 2014. upside risk inflation prevail, include greater-than-expected hike transportation prices, additional agricultural price pressures, give avian flu, low precipitation reduce water level dams, great volatility due uncertainty u.s. monetary policy normalization. the persistence high inflation carry risk fuel second-round effect may contaminate price wage formation process. thus, bank mexico govern board warn remain alert adverse supply shock order keep produce effect process convergence permanent inflation target remain track.4 4 see bank mexico’s monetary policy announcement, june 7, 2013. 4 bi central bankers’ speech conclude remark recent indicator highlight slow expansion mexican economy, largely cause global economic weakness. by next year, external environment improves, mexico’s economic activity expect post healthy pace. also, medium term, structural reform could enhance productivity. the financial volatility last week significant implication emerge markets. adjustment mexico orderly. in face possibility uncertainty may continue, prudence prevail part creditor debtors, authority remain alert order ensure time financial market operate normally. finally, increase annual inflation far year due negative supply shocks, reflect especially noncore component cpi. give temporary nature recent pressures, likely inflation soon resume downward trend toward 3 percent permanent target. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: monetary policy environment low growth interest rate speech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, nordea 3rd annual nordic aaa seminar, copenhagen, 13 june 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, it’s great pleasure speak 3rd annual nordic aaa seminar. today’s seminar examine aaa fixed-income market, consider investor issuer perspective. it clear central banker closely watch market crucial importance. take, instance, work monetary policy transmission. the impact central bank action term structure ‘risk-free’ rate backbone wide transmission monetary policy stance broad range asset prices, real activity eventually price developments. the price level ultimate objective mandate define treaty union level therefore challenge european court justice treaty change. moreover, high-rated sovereign debt also play key role collateral framework implementation monetary policy. and finally, yield aaa-rated sovereign bond provide central banker rich set information market’s outlook inflation future interest rates. the recent year crisis provide two important lesson sovereign debt markets. first, sovereign issuers, aaa rat work like automatic life-time subscription. it must rather interpret award require healthy public finance sound economic fundamental order keep it. and second, financial stability monetary policy transmission could risk smooth function sovereign debt market hampered. in remarks, i address three issue euro area perspective: • first, i give summary current economic environment euro area outlook economic activity inflation. • second, i elaborate late monetary policy decisions. • and third, i address specific question monetary policy. that one hand, challenge close zero low bind environment slowly recede financial sector fragmentation low interest rates. and hand, challenge arise keep interest rate low long. but aware forward guidance remark would provoke undue volatility. the currently low inflation environment certainly warrant accommodative monetary policy stance improve credit condition economy. but player game. engineer broad base recovery return sustain growth euro area base appropriate structural policy efforts. subdue price pressure medium term, economic activity expect stabilise slowly let start current economic condition euro area show combination subdue underlie price pressure, shallow recovery economic activity weak credit dynamics. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in euro area, output continue shrink first quarter year, witness decrease gross domestic product (gdp) output sixth quarter row. confirm bleak picture, unemployment rate stay double digit territory. on somewhat positive note, economic sentiment appear slowly pick low levels. look ahead end next year, govern council expect euro area export growth benefit recovery global demand. turn price developments, euro area headline inflation stand 1.4 percent may. our definition price stability positive inflation rate 2 percent. a capacity utilisation low economic recovery expect slow, expect price pressure remain subdued. inflation expectation well anchored. finally, dynamic loan private sector still feeble euro area. the weakness current expect economic activity certainly important factor depress loan dynamic private sector euro area economy. the need deleveraging several banks, corporation household drag growth dynamics. on top borrower still face elevate cost financing, also differ strongly across euro area. while fragmentation fund side receded, cannot say lend activity real economy. focus euro area banks’ lend policy – supply side loan – credit risk macroeconomic uncertainty remain main concerns, accord last wave bank lend survey april. in addition, need balance sheet adjustment across sector certainly contribute slow pace provision loans. euro area monetary policy remain accommodative what i describe sketch situation saw ecb’s govern council last thursday: on basis, decide monetary policy stance remain accommodative long necessary keep interest rate unchanged. beyond decision rates, on-going debate measure ecb could take, necessary, provide additional accommodation improve fund conditions, although, i mentioned, fragmentation fund side less concern lend side. this debate take broad scope, include instance: measure revitalise market asset back securities; additional long-term refinance operations; enhance framework additional credit claims; broad target change collateral policies. all limit measure study theoretically available shelf. it context, also issue set negative rate deposit facility come up. speak denmark today, i would like say word decision level deposit facility rate. some commentator wonder whether would consider take rate negative territory, many draw comparison danish case, central bank decrease rate certificate deposit minus 20 basis point july 2012. the possibly negative deposit rate one facet so-called “zero low bound” debate. while concept enjoy prominence academic literature several years, seem spread something routinely discuss taxi-drive small talks. at first sight, term “zero low bound” seem provide unambiguous metric: relevant monetary policy rate zero, cannot fall further. bi central bankers’ speech 3 one reason behind type nominal interest rate cannot fall zero. anybody hold asset negative remuneration would simply switch cash. then would ‘at least’ earn nominal return zero. however, reason may incomplete. one example case negative deposit certificate rate danish central bank i already mentioned. so obviously, certain circumstances, asset provide particular service make market participant will hold asset although display negative interest rates. to understand nature question possible negative deposit rate euro area, let quickly recall ecb operate corridor system consist three rates. first, main refinance rate interest ecb charge main refinance operation counterparties. it usually provide mid-point corridor system. second, marginal lend rate interest charge overnight lend eurosystem banks. it constitute ceiling corridor system. third, deposit facility rate govern remuneration excess reserve counterparties hold eurosystem overnight deposits. it constitute floor corridor system. moreover, also provide floor interbank market rate bank incentive lend fund rate market. set deposit rate value zero would imply remuneration excess reserve euro area negative. in words, bank charge make overnight deposit ecb. from technical point view, ready implement negative deposit facility rate. and, general, constellation conceivable eurosystem could deploy negative rate, deem require mandate safeguard price stability. so pro cons? theoretically, negative deposit rate may provide additional accommodation. in current environment excess liquidity, relevant overnight interest rate shift close deposit rate. in situation, reduction deposit rate could push overnight interest rate further. at time, possible caveat unintended side effect move keep mind. in particular, cross zero line set action market may run counter central bank’s policy ease intentions. for example, substitution private actor towards cash become high yield short-term asset. similarly, money-holding sector may promote financial innovation could emulate currency allow tax avoidance. these action may undermine underlie purpose move towards negative deposit rates. overall, consequence subject considerable margin uncertainty move never observe eurosystem major currency area world. how consideration differ underlie move denmark’s swiss central bank? both country apply fix exchange rate policy vis-à-vis euro area. in contrast, ecb consider euro exchange rate policy target. this add additional complexity monetary policy objective function. what could effect introduce negative deposit facility rate euro exchange rate? one principle single three factor would work. first, traditional interest rate differential channel could exert downward pressure euro. second, signal effect may amplify downward pressure, market participant would see realisation completely new scenario, previously price mere 4 bi central bankers’ speech possibility. at time, improvement macroeconomic prospect – intention policy move first place – would possibly exert upward pressure exchange rate. overall, also exchange rate, gauge impact move negative deposit facility rate might subject considerable uncertainty. also historical experience limit help: instance policy movement happen different economic constellation central bank work different monetary policy paradigms. so, conclusion, situation professional golfer huge set specialise club disposal – principle able master all. he draw suitable one depend position ball landscape facing. that is, negative rate bag tools, may may deploy depend economic landscape. this apply tool measure i mention well. in context, monetary policy strategy provide necessary flexibility react different economic market constellations. this flexibility derive medium-term policy horizon definition price stability. it define point target range permissible inflation outcomes. these two element flexibility ensure mechanically react temporary shift prices. instead, adopt steady hand approach. this avoid policy-induced volatility. challenge monetary policy environment fragmentation implication protractedly low interest rate this bring third last part: stand challenge face euro area? since outset financial crisis 2007, adjust expand toolkit order optimally equip serve objective price stability amid evolve challenges. the big challenge saw last year, i would summarize term ‘fragmentation’. what behind this? recall objective safeguard price stability euro area whole. however, fragmentation finance condition mean two firm credit risk, finance condition would depend area residence. the hold private households. a result, monetary policy stance transmit homogeneously part euro area. in words, crisis, interest rate cut 25 basis point pass bond yields, bank deposit rate lend rate similar fashion throughout euro area. now, pass-through become small average effect disparate across jurisdictions. one main factor contribute fragmentation increasingly perceive risk euro area might break country would return domestic currency – so-called redenomination risk. such fear manifest undue sizeable spread surcharge sovereign bond yields. but also affect sort financial asset prices, corporate bond yield finance rates, various contagion channels. so ‘fragmentation’ one word characterize main threat stability-oriented monetary policy, one successful answer summarize three letters: omt. this stand programme outright monetary transactions. omt keep motivation respective country consolidation necessary structural reforms. this ‘incentive-preserving’ feature omt result imply conditionality well fact removal excessive ‘panic’ component bond yield spreads, capital market exert discipline function via sovereign debt pricing. bi central bankers’ speech 5 finally, although single euro spend omt yet, programme highly successful already. let give examples, omt announcement certainly contribute positive developments, – course – cannot single sole responsible factor: sovereign bond spread stress jurisdiction come excessive level observe summer 2012; sovereign bond yield core country also normalise move upwards reflect reversal previously extreme flight-to-safety flows; bank deposit slowly flow peripheral countries; banks’ recourse eurosystem finance decreased; corporate bond spread financial market volatility come down; target balance – aggregate gross claim national central bank eurosystem – also decreased. while improvement certainly welcome, face two challenges: first, significant fragmentation – mitigate – remains. second, must wary potential side effect monetary policy. in fact, partial relaxation financial markets, i mentioned, already induce commentator ventilate idea may face renew exaggeration – unlike underprice risk see crisis market segments. some even assert protract period low interest rate could factor trigger distortions. in fact, low-interest-rate environment may principle spur underprice certain risks, support emergence asset price bubbles, provide incentive delay certain adjustment bank balance sheet risk zombie-banking evergreening. however, euro area see evidence broad-based mis-alignments asset prices. a case point, common valuation metric major stock price valuation level near historical average – rather exaggerate case early low-rate periods. at time, reason complacency, future build-up imbalance certain market segment cannot excluded. but exactly field macroprudential authority alert intervene market-specific instruments. so, let repeat context appreciation micro- macroprudential policy eu national level underway. regard require balance sheet adjustment benign market environment rather supportive factor that. decent stock market valuation levels, instance, tend decrease cost capital. that’s helpful re-capitalisation. moreover, banks’ balance sheet scrutinize upon transition single supervisory mechanism – require backstop possible recapitalisation need place. in case, level policy rate always understand reflect best attempt safeguard price stability euro area whole. i think, respect, single objective important guide post anchor inflation expectations, also make transparent traceable trajectory rate setting. conclusion outlook let conclude. almost six year outbreak financial crisis summer 2007 economic situation euro area far back normal. unemployment high several member states, growth expect return gradually credit real economy reach real economy fairly reluctantly overall different speed level across euro area countries. follow objective safeguard price stability, ecb activate variety non-standard measure improve transmission accommodative monetary policy stance. however, still operate difficult 6 bi central bankers’ speech environment fragmentation finance condition across euro area one prevalent problems. so let finish key message that, i think, characterise policy landscape time come: 1. monetary policy help prevent economic outcome even bad see today. monetary policy accommodation need keep price line ecb’s definition price stability. 2. the ecb run ammunition. we employ tool measure whenever needed. 3. but monetary policy limits: effective come structural issue keep mind challenge arise keep interest rate low long. therefore forget responsibility policy areas: 1. a properly design bank union essential restore financial integration support new steady state bank balance sheet fit lend 2. fiscal consolidation require spur maintain confidence consumer investor 3. structural reform key bring euro area economy back sustainable growth path. for ecb, different crisis mode require various modification tool box monetary policy instruments. but objective price stability remain time-invariant. it serve anchor stability euro area crisis; help transition new steady state better-integrated euro area economy; certainly remain guide principle future. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 gill marcus: celebrate good south africa economy address m gill marcus, governor south african reserve bank, fm top company award function, johannesburg, 26 june 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, thank

generate revenue export earn country. it even impressive time difficult uncertain economic conditions, globally locally, many firm perform well. you firm significant reason proudly say economy face many challenges, also highly resilient. we today recognise firm achievements. the economic environment difficult one. the world sixth year crisis: crisis repeatedly mutated, shift epicentre sub-prime crisis systemic bank crisis; liquidity, fiscal deficit sovereign debt crisis. measure take address element unintended consequences. austerity measure contribute unemployment crisis immense proportions, particularly young. there probably least one two form crisis safely say recovery sustainable. and even then, see unite state sign recovery, measure outline take cautiously considerable conditionality, taper quantitative easing, also unintended consequences. a see recent day weeks, exchange rate many emerge market economy impact negatively outflow capital. this development could well mark start new mutation ongoing global crisis. if thing get bad probably still take number year world back normal growth output gap fully closed. even then, debate whether new normal would low rate growth past. all all, uncertain difficult decade individuals, company countries. south africa’s weak first quarter annualised growth rate 0,9 per cent is, extent, consistent see happen globally emerge market development have, part, contribute towards weak rand exchange rate. but domestic factor also contributed. these lose production mine sector, instability cause violent often illegal strike action persistent capacity constraint infrastructure, electricity particular. the source vulnerability primarily large current account deficit, high budget deficit, rise public debt relatively low foreign exchange reserve well high household indebtedness inflation close top target range – suggest limit room fiscal monetary support. south africa actively take measure stabilise labour relation environment lead president zuma who, budget vote speech, set concrete step diffuse labour tension ensure labour dispute conduct peacefully within legal 2 bi central bankers’ speech framework. president zuma also focus structural reform implemented, within framework national development plan, ensure high inclusive growth go forward. currently financial market appear confuse monetary policy reaction function. this altogether surprising, monetary policy face extremely difficult dilemma. on one hand, slow growth downside risk, widen output gap signal need monetary accommodation, give absence significant demand pressure economy. these condition already result bank tolerant inflation upper end target range would normally case. this consistent flexible inflation target framework. on hand, see increasingly strong upside risk inflation outlook, primarily come exchange rate developments. have pressure simply result excess demand pressures, response would relatively straight-forward. but case. there number issue consider decision making: extent depreciation go sustained? will currency continue depreciate, settle current level overshoot case strengthen stage? this critical term extent pass-through inflation. we observe pass-through thus far far mute case previous episode currency weakness, possibly also reflection weak state economy. we ass whether pass-through remain low been, reach stage margin importer long squeezed? furthermore, spike inflation result depreciation, one-off increase pas number next year, generate depreciation-inflation spiral? most importantly, inflation expectation remain relatively contain current levels? these easy issue determine confidence, complicate strong market reaction suggestion u feed may begin slow pace bond-buying programme. our core mandate remain price stability, primary objective keep inflation within target range. currently forecast (and nearly private sector analysts) suggest inflation likely remain top band slightly above, return within target range. the downside risk growth outlook would suggest tolerate inflation levels. however, upside risk inflation outlook make accommodation difficult, automatically imply tighten monetary policy stance. this highly dependent see inflation trajectory unfold uncertain environment. in words, become even data dependent. there course always danger “behind curve” leave late (and know ex post). but time, sustain breach inflation target central forecast, downside risk growth imply would want unnecessarily pre-emptive. this essence monetary policy dilemma, require fine balance act. a already mentioned, south africa’s high quality firm key source strength south african economy. south africa vibrant, robust democracy sound constitution protect right citizens. this essential long term economic growth fruit growth share equitably. there several economic foundation-stones help u navigate difficult times. south africa’s macroeconomic policy sound, clear transparent. our macroeconomic institution enjoy high degree credibility respect, globally locally. flexible inflation target help anchor inflation expectation provide reserve bank scope support economic growth. bi central bankers’ speech 3 allow list least five additional strength opportunity south african economy: • south africa’s emerge middle class source strength, contribute rise consumption, creation new firm great social stability. • our proximity high growth african country already positive impact exports. • our natural resources, mineral natural beauty, provide huge potential investment mining, agriculture, tourism niche manufacture sectors. • south africa’s financial service sector recognise strength, country rank top three world regulation security exchanges, soundness bank sector access financial service part consider policy financial inclusion. • the efficacy legal framework strength audit account capacity provide conducive environment private sector operate in. i list many area steady progress made. these strength cause optimism economy reflect significant potential growth, employment creation share economic prosperity country. south africa’s infrastructure programme potential crowd private sector expand investment employment. investment electricity, renewable energy, freight rail, ports, water, road telecommunication enhance capacity economy, enable fast growth well improve efficiency private firms. two example worth mention here. first, adequate electricity provision critical. we know present cannot grow rate much excess 3 per cent without hit electricity supply constraints. we also aware certain investment project get grind lack certainty electricity supply. thus new energy capacity must bring stream soon possible, on-going investment sustainable energy capacity remain imperative. second, invest world-class road infrastructure gauteng already major impact economic efficiencies. accord independent study, overall average travel time n1 north road section buccleuch old johannesburg highway reduce 50 per cent 13 minutes. the improve travel time travel speed come despite 28 per cent increase traffic volume since implementation gauteng freeway improvement programme. furthermore, petrol consumption also decline le time spend idle highways, mention improve road safety reduce vehicle run costs. the need benefit economic efficiency bring expand infrastructure programme cannot overestimated. investment infrastructure benefit current future generations, provide private sector long term time horizon, encourage private investment, weak past years. we hope private sector respond appropriately, public-private partnership promote process. growth gross fix capital formation currently lead state own enterprises, south africa reach growth potential private sector’s role essential. in general, private sector contribute around two third investment. gross fix capital formation ratio gdp presently stand 19 per cent, high 23 per cent 2008, compare instance indonesia, fast-growing emerge market, stand 30 per cent. south africa’s infrastructure programme benefit many sector economy. go beyond south africa, africa’s infrastructure investment increase 4 bi central bankers’ speech us$10 billion 2000 us$45 billion 2010, set rise us$93 billion year 2020. south african construction firm well place integral part opportunity region. in 1960s, korean construction firm large contract build road south east asia. these firm source input south korean manufacturers, provide first growth stimulus them. similarly, south african construction firm grow order book globally use proportion south africa material capital equipment, stimulate manufacture sector. long term growth require partnership public private sectors, require much long horizon. too often catch paralysis short-termism. a long term perspective require policy certainty, trust institution confidence long term growth outlook. there increase recognition within private sector sustainable earn growth require long term horizon chase short term return always consistent long term sustainable growth. at least woe mine sector arise degree short termism amongst stakeholder sector. before era global capital markets, mine company able adjust volatility commodity prices. when price high, able accumulate cash balance sheets. they save money time price would fall. more recently, shareholder penalise company keep large pile cash balance sheets. this result large dividend payments. in turn, management take large bonus price high. worker demand high salary increase commodity price high. when price fell, mine company make loss cushion. it become much difficult company raise capital make losses. similarly, management bonus workers’ salary sticky. the necessity take long term perspective apply shareholder fix capital investment. it also apply human resource management. south african firm spend low proportion revenue train staff comparable firm countries. for firm globally, staff development win-win investment help raise productivity make work meaningful interest individuals. in country many deny adequate education, firm play crucial role train staff. we need remember lack education, poor education, great exclusion be. in many cases, absolute salary worker feel aggrieve about. it lack career-path opportunity move ladder source frustration. peter drucker, one father theory management, write the new reality (1989): “management’s fundamental task make people capable joint performance common

achievements, challenge expectation future remark mr emmanuel tumusiime-mutebile, governor bank uganda, annual general meet uganda institute bank financial services, kampala, 14 june 2013. * * * the board chairperson uganda institute bank financial service member board director institute, member institute present, ceo financial institution banker present, invite guest respective capacities, lady gentlemen, it great pleasure address agm uganda institute bank financial services. i begin thank board member institute arrange agm choice theme: “uganda’s financial sector 50; achievements, challenge expectation future” clearly pertinent everyone involve sector. in keep theme, i want share think i believe press challenge face financial service industry uganda today. these challenge must confront industry contribute fully effort transform structure economy move towards middle income status. i would like highlight three issue particular; need reduce interest rate spread bank industry; strengthen finance small medium scale enterprise diversification financial sector. the regional financial sector assessment program, conduct may year, show bank interest rate spread uganda high east african region burundi among high world. the interest rate spread uganda 2012 15 percent, compare le 12 percent kenya tanzania. spread high mainly heavy overhear cost high profit earn banks. overhead profit tax account 42 percent 28 percent banks’ gross income respectively 12 month end march year. unless reduce spreads, difficult bring bank lend rate level affordable borrowers. to reduce interest rate spread necessary bank cut overhead share income, become efficient. the bank industry profitable uganda: average return asset earn last 12 month 3.6 percent. but bank also recognize high lend rates, although enable large profit make short run, may damage long run prospect bank industry stifle growth bank lend private sector. since turn millennium, bank intermediation grow dramatically uganda. credit private sector rise 6 percent gdp 2000 14 percent gdp today. this important achievement demonstrate bank industry strengthen contribution broad economy. nevertheless, still important gap credit market closed. in particular, many small medium scale enterprise still struggle obtain finance need, form appropriate, support business activity investment requirements. part reason lie borrower themselves, especially regard poor business 2 bi central bankers’ speech management. but bank also contribution make enhance access credit small medium scale enterprises; example strengthen capacity evaluate business prospect creditworthiness loan applicant develop new way secure loan business enterprises. although financial sector uganda grow strongly since turn millennium, le progress make term diversification. the growth non bank financial sector, exception nssf, rather disappointing. our insurance industry, example, fifth size counterpart kenya term assets. a economy expand become sophisticated, i believe demand non bank financial products, life insurance, increase. consequently, unless financial sector diversify product range meet demand, customer uganda might force look firm elsewhere region purchase financial services. i hope forthcoming amendment financial institution act, allow bank undertake bancassurance partnership insurance company offer islamic financial product customers, together liberalization pension industry, help stimulate diversification financial sector. with remarks, i would like thank management board director uganda institute bank financial service give opportunity speak year’s agm. i also want wish stakeholder financial service industry best luck next fifty years. we together overcome enormous challenge first fifty year independence, especially 1970s 1980s economy collapsed. the industry hang survive economic turmoil year rose, phoenix like, recover 1990s. with spirit enterprise, hard work cooperation help ensure next half century

noyer, governor bank france chairman board director bank international settlements, iif (institute international finance) 2013 spring membership meeting, paris, 26 june 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, i please opportunity speak distinguish audience i thank president invitation. in light discussion “the future europe”, i wish first give overview current economic financial situation euro area discus major change currently underway considerably strengthen monetary union. 1. overview current economic financial situation euro area. before i start overview, i would like quote famous sentence jean monnet, one found father europe: “what matter neither optimistic pessimistic, matter determined”. in words, euro area need neither euro-bashing celebration, awareness action. a know, overall growth euro area weak years. the recent figure 0.2% contraction gdp first quarter 2013, follow decline 0.6% fourth quarter 2012. output thus decline six consecutive quarters, labour market condition remain weak. the euro area economy badly affect crisis (first financial, economic, sovereign debt), fiscal adjustment become necessary overcome negative impact growth well. ecb projection see gradual recovery take shape late year. a number element support view: • our accommodative monetary policy stance – remain long necessary – contribute underpin recovery; • recent development economic sentiment survey data show improvement low levels; • look ahead late year 2014, euro area export growth benefit recovery global demand, domestic demand support accommodative monetary policy stance recent real income gain due low oil price low overall inflation. • furthermore, significant improvement financial market see since last summer boost confidence generate wealth effect work way real economy, progress make fiscal consolidation. nevertheless, govern council continue see downside risk surround economic outlook euro area. they include possibility weaker-than-expected domestic global demand slow insufficient implementation structural reform euro area countries. overall, june 2013 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection euro area foresee annual real gdp decline 0.6% 2013 increase 1.1% 2014 thank three main drivers: export growth, accommodative monetary policy low inflation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 2. how boost growth euro area? a strong fiscal stimulus obviously appear unfeasible, give necessity rebalance public finances. i want stress two thing here: • the euro area rapidly efficiently set work cure fiscal weakness today boast best result among major develop economic regions: public deficit reduce 6.3% gdp 2009 approximately 3% today; end 2013, euro area show positive primary balance; • while commitment progressively achieve sustainable level public debt deficit achieved; measure need design way limit negative side-effects growth. for instance, effort need focus non-productive spending. in fact, one way durably raise growth potential economies, structural reform enhance competitiveness. it clear euro area well equip confront challenge 21st century. with 370 million consumer high purchase power, remain big market world. it also economically integrate area, highly qualify manpower good infrastructures. too often, however, euro area country prevent reap benefit position rigidity accumulate time, period easy growth. now, international environment challenging: new powerful competitor emerge comparative advantage shifting. there alternative adjustment. in field too, euro area make considerable progress recent years, especially country particularly large competitiveness gap vis-à-vis rest zone which, result, fell deep crisis neighbours: • we see significant improvement cost competitiveness measure unit labour cost (ulc). between 2008 2012, three programme country (greece, portugal ireland) cumulate ulc growth stand 12 percentage point euro area average. • the current account balance clearly show strong correction. in three programme countries, current account balance percentage gdp improve 9 percentage point 2008 2012. in spain, current account deficit improve 7 percentage point period. most adjustment drive contraction domestic demand. however, ireland, spain portugal export performance strong compare pre-crisis period. in total, euro area generate trade surplus 1% gdp 2012 compare around zero previous years. we expect surplus continue grow come years. the speed depth reform underway euro area economy unprecedented. they undertake reform area important competitiveness, growth sustainability public finance labour markets, product markets, social security, pension systems, etc. these reform prerequisite dynamic sustainable growth future must vigorously pursued. in addition clear determination different national level reduce deficit introduce necessary reforms, europe equip new disciplinary framework. the head state sign new fiscal compact year ago fix strict rule give extensive power european commission ass bi central bankers’ speech 3 compliance member states. this new compact go hand hand introduction rule monitor macroeconomic imbalances. it important understand institutional advance represent: effect, represent new treaty create strong commitment state via rule far good calibrate far bind place european monetary union began. 3. monetary union enhance bank union. a well year saw considerable strengthen fiscal macroeconomic discipline europe, 2012 also saw significant progress towards bank union. why bank union suddenly become indispensable urgent project? simply certain many problem experienced, could avoid bank union. a bank union necessary smooth function monetary union follow three reasons: • it break link bank sovereign bring bank supervision crisis management federal level. with bank union, bank consider euro area institution nationality; ensure credit condition euro area depend are, expect efficient financial market. • it allow re-integration european bank system. a supra-national supervisor fact good place ass risk cross-border activity therefore protect encourage activities; subject national bias lead temptation economic introversion. it therefore credible strengthen stability confidence area; • moreover, restore full efficacy monetary policy. if monetary policy impulse transmit uniformly area’s country bank-sovereign link, undermine foundation europe’s monetary union; remember three quarter finance euro area’s economy consist bank loans. by break link, bank union would restore federal dimension monetary policy. today first pillar bank union constructed: single supervisory mechanism. we currently work legal issues, identify systemically important bank within euro area, supervisory model, future data report and, course, asset quality review undertake take responsibility supervision. the governance structure adopt guarantee that, govern council keep decision power, conflict interest monetary policy bank supervision. on contrary, consistent supervision across euro area allow early detection potential risk imbalance and, ultimately, improve transmission monetary policy. this fundamental first step rapid implementation major success euro area. but, alone, cannot achieve objective bank union. that must rapidly construct two pillars: supranational bank resolution authority unify deposit insurance system. the bank union deliver high level structural coherence euro area’s financial system, already considerably strengthen since 2008: banks’ capital level substantially consolidated, certain activity streamline stress bank restructured. recent number show major advance european bank effort strengthen capital base, line basel iii requirement and, particular big international banks, quite comparable capital 4 bi central bankers’ speech strengthen u bank (when difference account standard neutralised). the bank reimburse half liquidity inject via two ltro programmes. 4. the eurosystem from first sign crisis (remember eurosystem inject 90 billion euro august 2007 counter impact first freeze financial markets), eurosystem provide constant support bank fund (and thereby underpin credit economy). we able use collateral framework – wide range counterparties accept – relieve liquidity constraint face banks. the maximum maturity operation increase three month crisis three years. through measures, address liquidity pressure bank avoid genuine credit crunch. both standard non-standard monetary policy prevent materialisation deflation risk. the programme launch year ago – outright monetary transaction – succeed counter speculation euro area break-up. it basic function follows: give state suffer unwarranted tension debt, could decide intervene far necessary, provide state commit agree recovery programme. undoubtedly, announcement creation omts strong impact: bank firm regain access capital markets; spread yield spanish german 10-year bond fell 6pp july 2012 3pp may 2013, premium italian 10-year bond halved. this new monetary policy instrument therefore foster considerable improvement financial condition euro area represent solid shield speculative attacks. the ecb’s govern council stress monetary policy remain accommodative long necessary. in period ahead, monitor closely incoming information economic monetary development stand ready act necessary. ********* the euro area get stronger: undergo major reforms, build new institution set powerful crisis management instruments. these major many respect historical advance lay foundation future monetary union. the effect financial market already visible: tension abate sign defragmentation start appear (target balance instance decline almost 300 billion euro 25% peak). we must pursue effort already initiate utmost ensure improvement fee real economy economic growth return unemployment reverse rise trend. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 dimitar bogov: impact international regulatory cooperation republic macedonia open speech mr dimitar bogov, governor national bank republic macedonia, 36th meet european bank federation, skopje, 7 june 2013. * * * distinguish participant 36th european bank federation associates’ meeting, dear guests, lady gentlemen, let wish warm welcome today’s meeting. the topic i want dedicate welcome speech international regulatory cooperation. the bank system republic macedonia predominantly foreign-owned consist mostly either subsidiary foreign bank bank own foreign portfolio investors. foreign ownership assist bank effort follow sound market practice, develop maintain high credit standard receive encouragement advice large long establish parent institutions. the global financial crisis eurozone debt crisis fundamentally change relationship. nevertheless, exceptional crisis constitute real challenge international global banking. the vienna initiative, framework safeguard financial stability emerge europe, valuable raise awareness deleveraging process develop europe unduly restrict operation bank subsidiary emerge europe. in context, important note even crisis stroke, deposit raise macedonian bank system predominantly foreign-owned domestic bank lend bank borrower republic macedonia. a rule, foreign funding, exclude equity reserves, exceed 10% source finance bank sector. there always difference amongst individual banks, reflection different strategy fund acquire sources, yet overall importance foreign fund percentage, long-term nature. this premise good business relation parent bank subsidiary based. when crisis stroke relative importance domestic deposit finance claim macedonian borrower actually increased. in republic macedonia ratio loan domestic gdp still 47–50%, ratio deposit domestic gdp around 55%. these ratio develop world tend 100%, show potential growth. similarly, ratio household debt, include mortgages, household disposable income, around 25%, substantially low country similar level development, also offer opportunity bank sector. regulatory capital allocation, average, 17%, two time legal minimum 8%. the high capitalisation bank mean capacity take loss need evergreen exist loans, lend new customer likely borrow. strong capital ratio one bright spot macedonian economy. the macedonian bank sector comprise 16 banks. this still somewhat high number, give country’s population, all, similarity product bank offering. further merger acquisition may positive impact cost management, turn make easy economy scale achieved. on hand, domestic merger acquisition unlikely involve cutback foreign ownership. enhance cooperation amongst regulator supervisor home host supervisor thus essential continue stability system. 2 bi central bankers’ speech yet exist precise definition international regulatory cooperation is. most time, bring mind system committee work group meet basel, bank international settlements. the international regulation outcome basel system, comprise among documents,

high opportunity cost hold capital. in economy emerge europe, include south east europe, criticism hear le often, give foreign ownership imply decision capital increase make group parent level. more

priority structure case possible bankruptcy, high capital allocation likely increase confidence whole bank sector, also aim basel system. to conclude, basel iii document important milestone development international financial regulation. it regulatory constitutive dimension: one hand, operate development require central bank regulator behave accordance principle order strengthen financial stability; hand establish even firm basel committee bank supervision pivot international regulatory cooperation centre concept risk-weight. but basel iii also invite question perhaps

korea, seoul, 14 june 2013. * * * dear fellow member bank korea, we come together commemorate anniversary bank korea’s establishment year, wherever work – seoul, domestic branch overseas representative offices. by honor history tradition establish serve us, reflect contribution development national economy bank korea, kind legacy leave come us, use opportunity look back past, analyze present, seek future directions. it occasion back 2010, celebrate 60th anniversary start new sixty-year cycle, pledge make bok ‘a lead advance central bank’ banner “global bok”. this declare resolve develop fully qualify member lead world-class organization reform bank korea strong resolve that, reborn lead central bank, bok play vital role steer course korean economy’s development. and three year pass already since begin bank’s second sixty-year cycle solemn declaration nation world. although country around world past five year struggle emerge great recession, see bad period economic crisis since great depression 1930s, effort bear sufficient fruit. on one hand country try various new unprecedented macroeconomic policies, order overcome crisis quickly possible achieve economic recovery. and hand devote utmost effort pursue global financial regulatory reforms, forestall future crisis prevent crisis recurring. and korean economy exception trend change, face variety challenge task line change environment home abroad. this situation comparable adventure explore unspoiled unknown world, effectiveness knowledge experience tested. in past, course, future always uncertain, uncertainty lift able enter new economic paradigm. what kind economic paradigm take shape u overcome serious uncertainty presently experiencing? what kind new lesson recent ordeal us? i believe time far able look back current situation one able overcome wisely, responsibility bring time forward. admittedly unable prevent crisis erupting, outcome largely decide skill tackle it. a way world, must wisdom turn current misfortune advantage. in today’s global economy, economy mutually interlinked, effort part country solve global problem hardly meet success. consider analysis high degree economic interconnectedness together procyclical policy increase systemic risk economy, decisive factor behind current global financial crisis, obvious involvement many countries, few, essential overcome it. although participation large number country course involve problem complicate decision-making process, i believe objection view global problem solve secure effective momentum toward solution system international cooperation. what important u that, active involvement international decision-making process, must express position view strive articulate vision nudge world economy onto course global economic development wish. indeed, involve actively clear 2 bi central bankers’ speech awareness path coincide maximization national interests. if unable take part international decision-making process, unable secure reflection position also face difficulty able obtain information enable timely adoption appropriate policy responses. today, commemorate 63rd anniversary bank korea, i would like share three task – related, specifically, policy tackle global financial crisis trend change international economic environment, redefine role bok line change economic condition home abroad, cultivation bok’s staff’s potential. dear friend colleagues, we pay attention ever possibility policy normalization major advance economy implement quantitative ease policy past years, influence international financial market emerge market economies. needle say, normalization necessarily mean return pre-crisis state. it does, however, comprehensively involve process resolve matter advance economy end us unconventional tools, effect country policy normalization develop, whether normalization take place orderly manner appropriate international policy cooperation, economic vision post-crisis era. and none issue unrelated korean economy. the financial crisis originate wall street, consequent international financial reform effort include basel iii; eurozone sovereign debt crisis cause spread global financial crisis, continue unrest international financial markets; fiscal problem u.s. include sequester, uncertainty surround resolutions; unprecedented policy tools, mobilize particular purpose, include japan’s qualitative quantitative easing(qqe) completely change basic framework monetary policy – none mean easy analyze, either separately comprehensively. some common characteristic country implement policies, however, policy rate close zero low bounds, currency key currency use international settlement. monetary policy principle conduct take account domestic economic situation, key currency country understand monetary policy inevitably international spillover effects. if key currency country overlook externality interpret dereliction responsibility maintain stability international economic order, currency may face risk possibly lose credibility reserve currency international community. for country like korea, meanwhile, whose currency key currency yet sufficiently internationalized, measure respond policy quantitative ease key currency country cannot find economic textbook write past. a new task us, therefore, find alternative measure appropriate domestic circumstance ourselves, research. under assumption relative value currency maintained, empirically identify effective low bind policy rate, correspond zero low bind key currency countries, another homework assignment must solve. in environment magnitude change increase globalization spread widely ever before, newly emerge policy task must work proactively find solution for. it may sound bite ironic, always bear mind that, although one cause current financial crisis strengthen interconnectedness among economy due rapid progress make globalization, process overcome crisis consequence also strengthen globalization. discussion quantitative ease termination exit strategy likely top agenda advance economy near future, review action plan normalization process carry out. needle say, extent impact bi central bankers’ speech 3 normalization process world economy depend upon whether advance central bank capacity manage market expectation appropriately market refrain overreacting. the importance communication market thus become emphasize still further. although pace economic recovery understand key determine time change monetary policy stance, fact cost sustain quantitative ease may become ever large time, relative benefits, also work factor move forward time change policy stances. there addition unavoidable reality marginal utility involve gradually diminish several country come undertake quantitative easing. there several issue u regard must focus address. first, question whether normalization take place synchronize sequence fashion. the former likely, circumstance individual advance economy concern vary, synchronize normalization actually happen influence likely enormous. and even case latter method normalization, occurrence increase capital flow exchange rate volatility persist extend period, mean emphatically say cost low. since range fluctuation depend upon relative influence effect various policy systems, need maintain timely watch change international financial market adopt flexible stance respond prevent excessive volatility capital flow exchange rates. the process sequence normalization meanwhile sequence across countries, also across various different policy tool introduce country second, process normalization entail rise interest rates, therefore rule possibility face risk global interest rate increase. we need also pay attention increase burden financial sector maintain soundness, demand raise additional capital due potential valuation loss bond holdings. from historical perspective, u.s. federal reserve’s interest rate hike mid-1990s cause long-term treasury bond rate rise significantly, due consequent drastic capital outflow latin american country experience series financial crises. in contrast, fed’s interest rate hike late-1990s trigger increase long-term bond rates, mid-2000s, despite rate hike feed long-term yield government bond even fell, trigger phenomenon refer “greenspan’s conundrum”. bear mind result policy rate hike may therefore vary significantly, must keep close eye market changes. we note economic crisis many country period interest rate increase past decade trace part common phenomenon rise fund cost decline asset prices, also attributable large extent financial institutions’ adverse selection. and adverse side effect economic vulnerability build widespread pursuit high-risk, high-return investment period low interest rate become evident rate begin rise. third, work internally identify effect various policy instruments, make preparation deal change external condition promptly time devote active effort elicit global cooperation. the ratio export gdp stand around 10 13 percent respectively u.s. japan, korea reach nearly 50 percent. we note stability international economic environment achieve global cooperation important korean economy, whose growth heavily dependent upon external conditions. meanwhile, since global rather regional equilibrium must achieve order maintain global economic growth stability, need redouble effort promote global cooperation create environment favorable us. my dear friend colleague bank korea, the revision bank korea act end 1997 give u single responsibility, price stability, achieve goal operate inflation target regime. with 4 bi central bankers’ speech 2011 revision act assume partial responsibility financial stability well, well aware achieve cooperation among government, supervisory authority central bank. in light this, need closely examine case u.s., operates, organization charge financial stability financial stability oversight council (fsoc), consist treasury department, nation’s supervisory organization fed, countries. all world today, central bank increasingly ask participate effort promote economic growth prevent future crisis active diverse means. although base premise within central bank’s legal responsibilities, fact ecb president mario draghi's promise last july “whatever take preserve euro” frequently mention strongly support policy intention since direct proof this. mr. draghi’s word show u central bank’s stand role rapidly change direction different past. and fact role bank korea also expand various ways, line change internal external environments. i would like consider current task face, divide four areas: first, all, maintain price stability responsibility stipulate article 1 bank korea act. we set medium-term inflation target range 2.5 3.5 percent next three year begin 2013, operate monetary policy accordingly. it central bank’s primary goal stabilize ensure medium- long-term inflation expectation economic agent converge inflation target, since use cpi inflation indicator, decisive influence inflation expectations, also important manage change cpi appropriately. one characteristic structure determine inflation korea price determinant supply side, oil vegetable prices, great influence countries. and stability price keep inflation low bind target range past months. since economic agents’ inflation expectation remain around 3 percent level, however, still exist inflationary bias. moreover, look international discussion see two extreme arguments. some one hand say, consider sustain low inflation many country since crisis, inflation concern vanish prepare instead risk deflation result hoard liquidity. a aftereffect excess liquidity supply advance countries’ quantitative ease policies, contrast, others expect inflation unavoidable future. and since korean economy sensitive change external conditions, we, nation’s central bank, must prepare cope whatever future course global economy takes. second, maintain financial stability become one major responsibility bank korea, since 2011 revision bank korea act begin place great emphasis macroprudential issue joint inspection financial institutions, gain increase access data financial institutions. we also successfully construct econometric model systemic risk assessment, work improvement financial stability report, statutory report submit biannually national assembly, recognize global level. while process overcome global financial crisis advance country manage economy exceptionally low interest rate environments, must bear mind comment that, environment, possibility never overlook accumulation economic vulnerabilities. the possibility fund flow continuously business subject restructure also rule out, vulnerability business become immediately apparent hike global interest rates. we must continuously monitor market pick imperceptible sign crisis, closely analyze data identify possibility tail risk, develop capability maintain financial stability. we must also redouble effort ensure overlook tail risks, closely examine whether probability distribution rely excessively truncate specific part upper low areas, bi central bankers’ speech 5 whether distribution represent entire population economy due kind selection bias. third, expand application credit policy task bank korea must also focus go forward. despite central bank around world adopt accommodative monetary policy stance provide sufficient liquidity markets, liquidity link real economy, fact point main cause country around world unable properly achieve growth. to overcome this, central bank are, commercial banks, attempt strengthen role provide fund small- medium-sized enterprise (smes) potential contribute economic growth. the bank england’s fund lend scheme (fls) smes cite good policy example, ecb also consider measure support smes. with recent introduction support program high quality technology start-up smes, bank korea also enlarge reform aggregate credit ceiling loan system dramatically, seek contribute enhance nation’s growth potential improve smes’ productivity. such policy financial inclusion policy previously consider fall within government’s brief, gradually come consider lie within domain central bank. central bank endeavor play active role effort strengthen real financial sector linkages. and heighten role credit policy complement monetary policy, try redefine expression “monetary credit policies” specify article 1 bank korea act conform circumstance era. fourth, must redouble effort build network lead central banks. to ensure global economic growth stability, cannot stress much importance share information among economy collaboration cooperation policy. the bank korea has, utilize proceed won-yuan swap agreement bank korea people’s bank china, initiate use domestic currency trade settlement early year. although still initial stage strive organize foster relate systems, say take first step, albeit cautiously, toward internationalization korean won, may ultimately need examine measure expand effort economy korea conclude ftas. in order support economic exchange involve islamic banking, area economic cooperation expect increase future, sign mou central bank unite arab emirate last week. go forward also plan sign mous central bank south america, would like meaningfully expand personnel resource exchange various central bank sign exchange agreement bank korea. to mind, various effort bear fruit ‘global bok’ truly established. dear member bank korea, if various wide range new operation discuss far limit purview small number departments, never achieve sought-after results. their effect realize department bank korea, include domestic branch overseas representative offices, hold common goal put practice. i would like make clear one among 2,200 staff member bank korea unconnected activities. i emphasize operation organization must rigid, come effective alternative need establish climate flexible mutual cooperation. if globalization refer disappearance border countries, truly find way respond globalization within organization border department disappear. the mission give u able nurture individual tune change environment, mean whose way think behavior globalized. it truth impossible overemphasize importance multi-disciplinary knowledge. 6 bi central bankers’ speech it judgment education train staff carry past years, strengthen potential capabilities, come great fruition. increase various kind publication write staff members’ names, well spread write paper staff almost department major feature regard. for example, number entry bok staff paper competition 23 2011 27 2012, increase substantially 38 year. the number contest participant also increase year – 38 44 56. another visible change, moreover, among participant eight lead, principal senior economists. the number staff participate international conference meanwhile also increase greatly, 351 2010 412 2011 457 2012. classify rank, among people 2012 141 economists, 103 senior economist 77 principal economists, mark increase see among senior economist economists. i promote participation lower-ranking staff working-level conference belief experience would enable play proper role participate conference higher-ranking official future. i believe start show desire results, convince continuation trend lead bright future bank. an even significant change identify look number joint research project carry headquarter domestic branches. these number one 2010, 35 2011 64 2012. among them, number project conduct jointly foreign institution exhibit dramatic change – zero 2012 four 2011 20 2012. and even though first half year yet passed, already 20 project currently way. the number joint research project carry domestic branch level one 2010, project also become active recently, increase 15 2011 17 2012. in meantime, collaborative joint research among domestic branch begin year, next month general manager domestic branch director general headquarter department plan meet discus three joint research project among domestic branches. from next quarter also plan release “bok quarterly regional economic report”, domestic branch take part. we expect see birth korean “beige book, utilize useful information nation’s regional economies. the majority study conduct domestic branch meanwhile recommendation study adopt policy-making local government concerned. since introduction 2011, number staff participate job train 286 global initiative program (gip) 144 intensive train program principal senior economists. there also 83 staff foreign central bank participate gip, help establish network bank bank korea, number foreign central bank applicant program rise. every year also around 10 bok staff member take part train program international institution foreign central banks. in sum, i think staff great potential provide opportunity display potential freely, see positive result this. intangible assets, necessary order bank korea become lead advance central bank, accumulate almost without notice it. i believe proud inspire achievements, produce considerable change short period time. dear fellow bok members, at international meet i often raise new issue era central bank competition horizon. i believe natural outcome increase impact central bank national economy line change characteristic times. although opinion raise first concept competition apply central bank seem somewhat awkward, since central bank institution country, fact valid concept since number different central bank global economy whole. and i stress every opportunity, bi central bankers’ speech 7 bank korea’s contribution korean economic development must small make u federal reserve, bank england people’s bank china respective economies. by capability comprehend central banks’ activities, establish implement policy tailor national economic condition well. perform vary function could compare face situation sometimes need aim move target. and environment, cannot say perform appropriate role simply follow theory practice establish economic conditions. we instead develop ability create alternative befit national economy. foster potential understand go wrong important effort find answer problem. we live era people equip critical mind capacity uncover new task urgently needed. if consider future put together thing i said, global financial crisis face u ultimately overcome strengthen dynamic characteristic economy eliminate uncertainties. it bear mind crisis temporary one, new steady-state equilibrium might create crisis become prolonged. low interest rate may already become entrench economy, instance, break achieve normalization could carry costs. to achieve economic recovery normalcy thus escape crisis, animal spirit must serve catalyst economy’s dynamic growth, time productivity must enhance constant restructuring. in order contribute national economic development encourage economic conditions, bank korea carry four role i discuss faithfully. on macroeconomic policy side, bank must support growth national economy recover level potential growth, microeconomic policy perspective maintain accommodative monetary policy devise mean financial facilitation ensure productivity smes increase. in process, meanwhile, importance financial stability downplayed. we must forget great moderation, enjoy stable inflation appropriate growth long period time, fail sense seed crisis sown. we far pay great social economic cost due uncertainty stem crisis yet realized. the rise corporate save amid crisis country clearly indicate lack corporate investment due uncertainty. and result low growth price paying. since risk mutual interaction uncertainty speculative activities, central bank responsibility closely monitor market condition order reduce adverse effect cause disruptive factor stem speculative capital. before concluding, i would like say words. today able confirm together incalculable challenge lie ahead us. however, organization confront rather shrink challenge thrive. it become clear recently organization’s response capability greatly enhanced, employee actively utilize potentials. base upon confidence, let u cultivate public servant spirit central bankers, strengthen bank’s status central bank hold great respect public. we need develop society become interest demand talents. to end, great spirit sacrifice service foundation lives. if steadily move forward consistency strong belief future, bank korea recognize contribution national economy. perspiration, tear pain fate sow seeds. i look forward see many leader emerge bank. bi central bankers’ speech 1 william c dudley: be recent college graduate find good jobs? remark mr william c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york chairman committee global financial system (cgfs), regional economic press briefing, new york city, 27 june 2013. * * * good morning welcome new york fed’s regional economic press briefing. i please opportunity talk journalist cover region – people district. this morning i briefly discus condition national economy focus regional economic conditions, particular attention question whether recent college graduate find good jobs. we examine trend see play region. a always, i say reflect view necessarily federal open market committee (fomc) federal reserve system. national economic condition i would like begin take stock moment. then i address expectation performance economy remainder 2013 2014. since end great recession mid-2009, 15 consecutive quarter positive growth real gdp. however, average annual growth rate period 2.1 percent. although unemployment rate decline 2.5 percentage point peak 10 percent october 2009, much decline due fact labor force participation rate fall 1.5 percentage point period. recall discourage worker actively look work regard participate labor force count unemployed even though without jobs. use alternative measure, employment population ratio, influence change number discourage workers, limit improvement labor market conditions. job loss rate fallen, hire rate remain depress low levels. take together, labor market still cannot regard healthy. numerous indicators, include behavior labor compensation household assessment labor market conditions, consistent view remain great deal slack economy. that said, i see persuasive evidence improve underlie fundamental much private sector u.s. economy. key measure household leverage decline low level well decade. household net worth, express percent disposable income, increase back average previous decade, reflect rise equity home price decline liabilities. bank begin ease credit standard somewhat prolong period tightness. a result, experience fairly typical cyclical recovery consumer spend durable goods. for example, light-weight motor vehicle sell seasonally-adjusted annual rate 15.3 million may, far 16.1 million sale 2007. similarly, five year house production well consistent underlie demographic trends, appear work excess supply house build boom year last decade. house start sale clear upward trend, widely follow national home price index around 2 bi central bankers’ speech 12 percent twelve month end april.1 indeed, anecdotal report suggest higher-than-expected increase home price due lack home sale. unfortunately, improvement consumer spend durable good house yet show overall gdp growth rate due significant headwind continue face. first, federal fiscal policy recently become quite contractionary. estimate congressional budget office (cbo) indicate fiscal restraint order 1.75 percentage point potential gdp year. in period since 1960, two previous episode fiscal contraction order magnitude – 1969 1987 – occur economy solid foot today. second, euro area experience protract recession growth many large emerge economy slowed. this result sharp slow u.s. exports, associate slow production employment growth u.s. manufacture sector. thus, i continue see economy tug-of-war fiscal drag underlie fundamental improvement, great deal uncertainty force prevail near-term. this tug-of-war clearly see monthly employment data. over april may, average monthly gain employment private service-providing sector well maintain 175,000. in contrast, employment manufacture sector federal government decline combine 20,000 per month. and result uncertainty is, i believe, important contribute factor behind relatively sluggish pace business investment spending. my best guess growth 2013, measure q4/q4 basis, since end recession. but i believe strong case make pace growth pick notably 2014. the private sector economy continue heal, amount fiscal drag begin subside. i also see indication growth prospect among major trade partner begin improve; example, rise june euro area composite purchase managers’ index. and combination event likely create environment business investment spend gather strength. finally, i believe tug-of-war analogy useful explain recent inflation dynamics. a well known, total inflation, measure personal consumption expenditure (pce) deflator, slow sharply past year run fomc’s express goal 2 percent. much slow total inflation due decline energy price result weaken global growth mention early combine increase energy production u.s. however, also case core inflation, is, exclude food energy, slow sharply well. a decomposition slow core inflation reveal due slow rate increase price non-food non-energy goods. this probably due large part soften global demand good modest appreciation dollar occur since mid-2011. in service sector, rate increase price medical service “non-market” service – latter include financial service – also slow notably recently. in contrast, rate increase price non-energy service relatively stable. compare set condition 2010, recent slow inflation le widespread across core good core services, inflation expectation far decline le appreciably 2010. thus, best guess core good price begin firm month ahead global demand begin strengthen inventory get good alignment sales. 1 corelogic report show home price rise 12.1 percent year over year april. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a always case, substantial uncertainty surround forecast. moreover, always possibility unforeseen shock. thus, monitor u.s. global economic condition carefully adjust view likely path growth, inflation unemployment rate accordingly response new information. at meet last week, fomc decide continue accommodative policy stance. it reaffirm expectation current low range federal fund rate target appropriate least long unemployment rate remain 6.5 percent, long inflation inflation expectation remain well-behaved. it important remember condition thresholds, triggers. the fomc also maintain purchase $40 billion per month agency mb $45 billion per month treasury securities, state goal promote substantial improvement labor market outlook context price stability. in statement, fomc say may vary pace purchase economic condition evolve. a chairman bernanke state press conference follow fomc meeting, economic data next year turn broadly consistent outlook fomc see likely, roughly similar outlook i already lay out, fomc anticipate would appropriate begin moderate pace purchase late year. under scenario, subsequent reduction might occur measure step first half next year, end purchase around mid-2014. under scenario, time asset purchase come end, unemployment rate likely would near 7 percent economy’s momentum strengthening, support robust job gain future. here, point deserve emphasis. first, fomc’s policy depend progress make towards objectives. this mean policy – include pace asset purchase – depend outlook rather calendar. the scenario i outline – one possible outcome. economic circumstance could diverge significantly fomc’s expectations. if labor market condition economy’s growth momentum le favorable fomc’s outlook – happen recent year – i would expect asset purchase would continue high pace longer. second, even scenario occur pace purchase reduced, would still case long fomc continue asset purchase add monetary policy accommodation, tighten monetary policy. a fomc add stock securities, continue put downward pressure longer-term interest rates, make monetary policy accommodative. third, federal reserve likely keep asset balance sheet long time. a chairman bernanke note press conference last week, strong majority fomc participant long favor sell agency mb security monetary policy normalization process. this imply big balance sheet longer, provide additional accommodation today continue support mortgage market go forward. fourth, even scenario, rise short-term rate likely long way off. not likely take considerable time reach fomc’s 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold, also fomc could wait considerably long raise short-term rates. the fact inflation come well fomc’s 2 percent objective relevant here. most fomc participant currently expect short-term rate begin rise 2015. some commentator interpret recent shift market-implied path short-term interest rate indicate market participant expect first increase federal fund rate target come much early previously thought. set aside whether correct interpretation recent price moves, let emphasize expectation would quite sync fomc statement expectation fomc participants. 4 bi central bankers’ speech regional economic condition let turn regional economy, focus presentation today. our last brief regional economy take place difficult time – soon superstorm sandy. while economic life return normal across metro area, hardest-hit area still struggle recover rebuild. just block here, fact, south street seaport business district still far business-as-usual. and many neighborhood across metropolitan region, low-lying coastal area new jersey brooklyn, queen long island; staten island southern connecticut. one encourage sign, though, broad regional economy show remarkable resilience. it grow add job reasonably good pace. moreover, rebuild effort appear give bite boost job market industry construction. a we’ve discuss before, new york feed produce economic activity index help monitor performance new york state, new york city new jersey. base measures, new york city continue grow strongly, new jersey’s economy see pickup growth since begin year. however, growth new york state slowed, puerto rico’s economy fare well all; activity index produce government development bank puerto rico show island’s economy yet show sign bottom out. the job situation vary somewhat across region. improvement generally broad-based, new york city long island particularly well, though puerto rico continue weaken. both connecticut new jersey recently grow roughly line nation thus far 2013. unemployment rate across region roughly match national rate, exception relatively high rate characterize puerto rico’s labor market time. house continue focus regional monitor effort home price region appear bottomed. our economist elaborate point morning. be recent college graduate find good jobs? the special topic today’s press brief look well recent college graduate fare job market, nationally region. a college education represent important investment one’s human capital, mean knowledge skill people build. historically, it’s pretty clear who’ve invest college education tend earn sizeable economic return. and benefit college-educated citizen go well beyond individual. region high concentration college graduate tend innovative, high live standard experience rapid economic growth.2 so college education play important role help individual prosper, well strengthen broad economy. more recently, though, rise costs, increase student debt widespread report recent college graduate able find good job raise trouble question whether go college still good investment. in fact, research, include material discuss last press briefing, show dramatic increase student debt past decade.3 in today’s briefing, we’re go take 2 see, example, edward l. glaeser, jose a. scheinkman, andrei shleifer (1995) “economic growth cross-section cities,” journal monetary economics, 36, 117–43; gerald a. carlino, satyajit chatterjee, robert m. hunt (2007) “urban density rate invention,” journal urban economics, 61, 389–419; jaison r. abel todd m. gabe (2011) “human capital economic activity urban america,” regional studies, 45, 1079–90. 3 see, example, press brief q4 2012 household debt credit report; meta brown sydnee caldwell, “young student loan borrower retreat house auto market liberty street economics bi central bankers’ speech 5 close look question weak today’s labor market new college graduate put recent experience context use hard data. it important u undertake kind analysis because, we’ll show, newly mint graduate always take time transition labor market find job utilize education. and young people college degree still fare far good without. at time, sluggish job recovery recession, it’s clear transition recent graduate labor market take longer, they’ve experience high unemployment high underemployment year past.4 still, time get tough recent graduates, shouldn’t hasty conclude get college education won’t help people find good jobs. i ask jason bram present update economic condition region. blog post, april 17, 2013; andrew haughwout, donghoon lee, wilbert van d klaauw, joelle scally, “just released: the geography student debt,” liberty street economics blog post, may 14, 2013. 4 underemployment, purpose presentation, refer college graduate work job typically don’t require college degree. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: make financial system resilient keynote speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, 2013 fese (federation european security exchanges) convention, berlin, 27 june 2013. * * * 1. introduction president jochumsen lady gentleman thank today year’s fese convention. it first time i attend event, although numerous point contact security exchange central banks. central bank security exchange common provide economy infrastructure essential well-functioning market economy. exchange provide function regulate platform trade securities, contribute efficient allocation capital resources. central bank maintain price stability, thereby among thing also contribute allocation efficiency lay foundation sustainable growth. another important task central bank smooth operation payment systems. the eurosystem provide important infrastructure financial system, particular target2. by establish target2-securities eurosystem also provide harmonise centralise method settle security central bank money europe improve settlement efficiency. 2. the role financial market regulation some year ago, financial integration europe consider one-way street lead great wealth. this view challenge financial crisis, since show flip-side financial integration europe, mutual contagion. in order reap benefit financial integration without downside risk contagion effects, micro-prudential regulation need tighten effective macro-prudential regulation established. more generally, crisis also challenge formerly wide-spread view outcome financial deregulation always good. adair turner, former chairman british fsa, self-critically confess speech give ca business school 2010: “we philosophically incline accept innovation create new market product must beneficial, regulation stymie innovation must bad.” i definitely want deny merit innovative, flexible financial markets. but hindsight, i think also hard deny insufficient financial market regulation well inadequate oversight supervision help macroeconomic financial imbalance emerge intensify. moreover, difference speed scope financial deregulation national regional level lead regulatory arbitrage financial market players. the pendulum swing back since onset financial crisis. when leader g20 pledge november 2008 “to strengthen regulatory regimes, prudential oversight, risk management, ensure financial markets, product participant regulate subject oversight”, start shoot comprehensive global regulatory reform agenda. 2 bi central bankers’ speech almost five year later, great deal done. many issue tackle reform already implemented. yet great deal still need do maintain political interest stable financial system appropriate regulation. the key objective financial regulation make financial system stable therefore resistant shocks. on hand, regulation must maintain financial system’s ability fulfil service role real economy appropriately. in regard, i agree robert shiller, belief value add financial system. in recent book writes: “finance, despite flaw excesses, force potentially help u create better, prosperous equitable society.” hence, financial regulation address market failure abolish market mechanism. 3. strengthen principle liability in order achieve key objective stable shock-resistant financial system, essential strengthen principle individual responsibility liability. the principle liability one basic principle function market economies, clearly also apply financial system. essentially, say benefit also bear costs. one root cause financial crisis that, financial sector, principle liability weakly implemented. however, lack liability create incentive take excessive risks. the problem bank “too big fail” may illustrate this. ultimately, systemic importance infringe principle liability. excessively risky transaction go unpunished benefit bear costs. the decisive question principle liability could strengthen regulatory measures. • in case banks, high capital requirement favourable choose way. they enable bank shoulder great loss themselves, thus shift risk back owners. the implementation basel iii – europe hopefully unite states, – therefore important step towards make financial system safer. in addition implementation basel iii, i convince would make bank sector le vulnerable and, thus, strengthen liability bank require hold sufficient capital claim sovereign allow accumulate large scale future. • the principle liability also important regard establishment european bank union, currently subject heat debate. the main task single resolution mechanism currently develop ensure correct sequence liability. if bank restructure resolved, equity investor call first take losses, follow provider debt capital depositors, take due account deposit guarantee respective member state national european rescue funds. taxpayer call upon last resort. while joint liability imply joint control, way round also true. however, even creation bank union, banks’ balance sheet also remain mirror national economic legal developments. change national insolvency law i.e. would impact burden possibly finance european funds. hence, bank union need far-reaching coordination tight joint regulation. remain room manoeuvre regulation national level consider decide distribution financial burden bi central bankers’ speech 3 member states. legacy risks, however, relate bank union. if actually decide communitise legacy debts, would financial transfer. transparency member general public taxpayer also require transfer disclose such. of course, transfer usually reinforce liability principle. it go without say strengthen liability principle go beyond bank regulation. regulatory measure field financial system make sure non-bank financial entity become liable accountable, too. let give two example in future, credit rat agency hold liable event intentional grossly negligent violation respective european regulation. i appreciate this, clear difficult prove deliberate intent gross negligence practice. however, make credit rat agency liable accountable help improve quality integrity credit ratings, sufficient ensure proper risk management financial system. in order improve due diligence, also require – intend new eu regulation cra iii – reduce mechanistic reference external credit rat financial market regulation, lead overreliance external ratings. although external rat still role play financial markets, investor become good able conduct risk assessment, become responsible investment decisions. after all, rat substitute thought. another case could see example regulators’ commitment increase liability market participant reform otc derivative markets. much progress already make require sufficient collateralisation derivative positions, especially clear centrally central counterparties. in words, market participant force bear cost derivative business near future. the clear obligation complement trade obligation eligible otc derivatives. last week eu finance minister agree common position regard revision mifid (markets financial instrument directive) significant impact european exchange trade venues. the mifid review shift significant share otc derivative trade exchange regulate trade venues. light shine dark trade trade transparency requirements, lead accountability derivative traders. 4. beware risk government failure the basic task financial regulation cure market failure. the large number regulatory work strand might create impression the, times, exaggerate faith efficiency market crisis replace excessive faith governments. the financial crisis, however, result market failure. to extent, also result government failure undue regulation. just think public incentive home ownership help house bubble various country emerge zero-risk weight sovereign bond give incentive over-invest sovereigns. hence, regulator refrain substitute fine-tune market private agents. we bear mind walter eucken, one found father german ordoliberalism, wrote, namely economic policy aim “the shape form order economy” “not direction economic process”. 4 bi central bankers’ speech regulation end itself. the cost benefit plan measures, include side-effects interactions, weigh up. one example plan financial transaction tax. while fundamental political consensus reach introduction tax country eu, unintended side-effects consider carefully. in originally envisage form, tax would also cover collateralised money market transactions, know repo transactions. this would cause considerable harm repo market, play key role redistribution liquidity among commercial banks. however, hamper would make bank dependent liquidity provision central banks. 5. conclusion to sum up, past five years, substantial progress make regulation financial system. nevertheless, room complacency. there still shortcoming financial regulation eliminated. this notwithstanding, necessary thoroughly ass impact different reform measures. ensure player financial system to, able to, good bear loss risk future make financial system stable. strengthen principle liability help financial system serve economy society better. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: crisis economics – crisis challenge economist lecture dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, annual gala meet munich volkswirte alumni, munich, 13 june 2013. * * * 1. welcome mr baader member munich volkswirte alumni-club lady gentleman i would like extend warm welcome deutsche bundesbank munich. at time, i wish thank volkswirte alumni-club invite give year’s lecture. even bundesbank, every day many economist gather together, bundesbank employ large number economists. i would therefore like take opportunity talk economist role crisis. before that, however, i would like offer sincere congratulation evening’s prize winner receive awards. 2. have economist failed? on 6 april 2009, severe earthquake occur central italian town l’aquila tragic loss 300 lives. only six day earlier, meet national commission forecast prevention major risks. afterwards, expert make public declaration that, despite tremor past days, currently heighten risk earthquake region. lady gentleman i tell incident possible draw instructive parallel role play economist crisis. in much way seismologist accuse give ample warn possibility earthquake, economist accuse give ample warn loom financial debt crisis. and much engineer accuse make build earthquake-resistant, economist accuse build design flaw financial economic system, whole nation suffer consequences. economist never best reputations, even academic world. many may feel topic occupy economist common vulgar – money. a silvio gesell write 1911, “lofty idealist easily find subject investigation attractive money. religion, biology, astronomy, example, infinitely edify investigation nature money.” by way, silvio gesell find object investigation interest enough develop theory money, even though, today’s perspective, cannot exactly class part mainstream. fortunately, sufficient number “lofty idealists” ensue 100 year find attractive edify study money economy. over course time, economist gain fair amount influence policymaking, too, opponent development long brand 2 bi central bankers’ speech “economisation” politics society. with 2007 financial crisis ensue critical developments, unease economist clearly grew, however. it become fashionable berate economists. for instance, philip stephens, associate editor financial times, recently write “the economy important leave economists”. in view, accusation level economist are, best, partly justified, however. allow use event l’aquila way illustration. the global financial crisis often describe “quake financial markets”. but unsatisfactory metaphor. and financial crisis, unlike earthquake, natural disaster. on contrary, crisis 100% man-made. economics exact science: social science. the law economics law nature. earthquake explain natural phenomena. when, force earthquake strike cannot predict accuracy, however. it nevertheless possible say advance region severe risk earthquake le exposed. certainly, financial stability review economic study prior crisis contain hint shift financial system. bis, example, give repeat warn setback potential stem rapid growth credit securitisation credit derivative segments. just refresh memory: 2001 2007, volume credit default swap grow factor 100. the macroeconomic risk arise development financial market scarcely perceived, perceive all, however. one key reason likely fact financial market modelled, best, rudimentary manner macro model serve important basis economic projections. look back, possible say financial economics macro economics make impressive progress past decade – unfortunately parallel cooperation other. it recently research switch focus strongly interaction financial sector real economy. talk progress: the ongoing refinement statistical-econometric method application economic research bring light significant insights. nevertheless, crisis arouse doubt triumphal progress mathematics economic sciences. by contrast, economic historians, already think something backwater, attract attention again. have say that, modern economic historian indeed also make use method empirical economic research, look back past customary. the book “this time different” carmen m. reinhart kenneth s. rogoff one best-selling book crisis literature; also reminder financial debt crisis constantly recur phenomenon centuries. one classic financial history, “manias, panic crashes” charles p. kindleberger, rediscover every crisis. in it, kindleberger show numerous episode early century repeatedly witness speculative bubble exaggeration asset markets: tulip mania 17th century holland, example, south sea bubble mississippi bubble 18th century, perhaps trigger first international financial crisis. kindleberger cite one banker invest share south sea company 1720 say that, rest world take leave senses, one must join certain extent. that reminiscent chuck prince, former ceo citigroup, who, 2007, come legendary remark “as long music playing, you’ve get get dance”. bi central bankers’ speech 3 there’s nothing new sun, one might say summary. 3. do economist rethink? 3.1 financial market regulation yet, crisis also call question number economic policy paradigms. first foremost, financial debt crisis reveal design flaw financial monetary systems. the liberalisation financial market view much critically crisis. confidence efficiency market severely shake financial crisis many financial market product fail demonstrate promote macroeconomic welfare. now, financial market regulation tighten negative macroeconomic consequence financial crisis move spotlight again. lord turner, former chairman british financial service authority (fsa) come straight point 2010 talk financial innovation regulation, admit self-critically “we philosophically incline accept innovation create new market product must beneficial regulation stymie innovation must bad. we aware instability risk might offset benefit innovation.” 3.2 role central bank since financial crisis, also discussion role play central banks. first, experience financial crisis raise question monetary policymakers deal asset price bubbles. the prevail opinion crisis monetary policy blunt sword deal exaggeration asset markets. to “prick bubble”, interest rate would increase sharply would entail severe macroeconomic collateral damage. a argument prick bubbles, claim central bank unable identify emergence bubble good early well-informed market players. instead, central bank clear mess, speak, bubble burst mean massive interest rate cut injection liquidity. however, approach, also know jackson hole consensus, greenspan doctrine simply “mop-up strategy” discredit crisis. even though favour burst speculative bubble far between, policy actively lean wind gain widespread support. this approach often refer “more symmetrical monetary policy". however, mean monetary policy assume responsibility financial stability. macroprudential policymakers appropriate toolkit safeguard financial stability. in context, act monitor financial stability (gesetz zur überwachung d finanzstabilität) assign bundesbank important task field macroprudential oversight. the bank responsible, particular, analyse factor key financial stability, identify risks, make proposal financial stability committee regard issue warn recommendations, evaluate implementation warn recommendations. nonetheless, keep mandate safeguard price stability, monetary policymakers also contribute towards stability financial system encourage financial market excesses. monitor effect credit aggregate long- 4 bi central bankers’ speech term price development regularly meticulously, eurosystem part monetary analysis, bring forth valuable information. it well-known fact financial crisis typically precede excessive credit growth, quote charles kindleberger again, “most increase supply credit lead mania – nearly every mania associate rapid growth supply credit particular group borrowers.” the extremely low interest rate currently see many economy associate risk long term. the chairman federal reserve, ben bernanke, highlight long ago. thus, central bank face challenge time tighten extremely loose monetary policy currently place, risk price stability emerge. against backdrop low price pressure weak economic growth euro area, ecb govern council loosen monetary policy stance may, cut key interest rate new record low. it euro area monetary policy buttress economy financial system greatly unprecedented scale since outbreak crisis. a well cut interest rate record low, eurosystem also adopt unconventional measures, significant virtually unrestricted allotment central bank liquidity, extend maturity central bank refinance operation three years, broaden eurosystem’s collateral framework introduce outright transactions, include sovereign bond purchases. in course crisis, central bank entrust ever responsibility – officially unofficially. escb central bank play central role macroprudential supervision, ie part european systemic risk board, bundesbank form integral part german financial stability committee (ausschuss für finanzstabilität). the european single supervisory mechanism place aegis european central bank (ecb). furthermore, wake crisis, policymakers, market medium talk eurosystem body capable take action. however, entail risk overload central bank many task much responsibility. the crisis management measure take central bank set debate motion, euro area economic areas. it debate anything pleasant, and, all, one seem long since over. follow inflation shock 1970s, 1980s saw consensus gradually emerge central bank primarily responsible safeguard price stability need independent possible perform task. independent central bank bundesbank swiss national bank prove successful combat inflation central bank political direction. a result, central bank around world grant independence could credibly carry task fight inflation. however, late, central banks’ independence price stability orientation call question again. indeed, central bank completely innocent regard issue. they, too, greatly stretch boundary mandate time crisis. otmar issing fittingly comment problem recently, saying, “it clear task central bank take go beyond policy framework establish safeguard price stability, come fire line political disputes. central bank also endanger independence promise actually capable deliver monetary policy instrument available them”. bi central bankers’ speech 5 3.3 european monetary union the root current crisis euro area notably include excessive lend foster insufficient financial market regulation, inadequate compliance fiscal rules, inefficient use capital inflow cumulative loss competitiveness several euro-area countries. much like earthquake expose design flaw building’s construction, financial crisis clearly bring light dangerous crack lurk structural framework monetary union. the cornerstone maastricht framework include concept independent central bank primary objective safeguard price stability, national sovereignty fiscal policy matters. the framework assign liability control national finance national governments. the framework set fundamental principle ensure compliance agreement. member state commit maintain sound public finances; strictly prohibit provide financial assistance (no-bail-out rule), although exception allowed; central bank permit finance governments. however, crisis management measure seriously call question bind force rules. when monetary policy call upon carry fiscal tasks, sooner late lose ability maintain stable prices. furthermore, go avenue comprehensively mutualising liability shift liability european level accompany transfer control. however, sign member state will hand veritable control intervention right brussels. it impossible say absolute certainty whether monetary union crisis-proof. economist identify design flaw point beforehand. in many respects, however, policymakers time ignore advice give economists. in book “making european monetary union” economic historian harold jam also make use engineer analogy. he stress “the monetary union without well-established base fiscal regime without stable financial system high centre gravity make vulnerability instability”. before maastricht framework established, bundesbank, too, point monetary integration would sustainable long term without bring political integration. in statement 19 september 1990 establishment economic monetary union, bundesbank make position clear say “monetary union irrevocable community solidarity which, basis experience, need far-reaching commitment form comprehensive political union permanent”. however, instead political union, above-mentioned maastricht framework established, since prove vulnerable. a long political union enjoy back european general public governments, however, strengthen maastricht framework introduce something like “maastricht 2.0” right approach return stability monetary union. so “maastricht 2.0” mean me? • it mean strengthen principle national responsibility reinforce regulatory framework and, so, realign liability control. • it mean keep crisis mechanism last resort stave threat financial stability euro area. nonetheless, sovereign default bank insolvency must possible future without pose large risk financial stability; includes, i believe, bring end regulatory privilege enjoy sovereign debt. 6 bi central bankers’ speech • it also mean establish bank union, encompass single supervisory mechanism systemically important financial institution clear-cut resolution restructure regime. the necessity recognise acknowledge bank union without doubt one great lesson learn euro-area crisis. therefore, establishment european bank union, already begin take form, key component stable monetary union. combine efficient regulation, would lessen burden place single monetary policy reduce interdependency bank sovereign escalate effect crisis. 4. conclusion i would like conclude remarks. the crisis experience various form since 2007 pose huge challenge economists. it cast doubt many issue beyond debate crisis. it also raise many new questions. economist need face question critically ass role responsibilities. and need adopt new mindset many fields. • we need intelligent financial market regulation. • we need keep close eye stability financial system • we need crisis-proof framework monetary union. yet, time, area paradigm shift would appropriate. independent monetary policy gear safeguard price stability clearly segregate fiscal policy, render obsolete crisis – quite opposite, fact, important ever before. so need economist call everything question were. even philip stephens, ft associate editor, i already cite above, offer comfort financial time opinion piece remarks, “economists always wrong”. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: introductory remark french assemblée nationale speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, french assemblée nationale, paris, 26 june 2013. * * * presidents, honourable member parliament, i would like thank warmly invite address historic chamber. a president european central bank, honour speak nation do much promote cause european integration. it exactly 300 year ago, 1713, abbé de saint-pierre present project perpetual peace, one first vision union european nations. that vision emerge reality thank large part generation french thinker pioneers, like jean-jacques rousseau, victor hugo, aristide briand. it also thank maker modern european union like robert schuman, jean monnet, jacques delors. in words, country play key role build peaceful, open unite europe see today. but know, eu, euro area particular, face important question direction. it need new consensus move forward. i confident france play key role process. in introductory remark today, i would like focus three topics: ecb’s monetary policy, growth adjustment euro area, progress towards build deep economic monetary union. i today present ecb’s views, also listen learn. i look forward hear opinion take questions. the ecb’s monetary policy let begin ecb’s monetary policy. the ecb’s mandate maintain price stability, essential support long-term growth, defend citizens’ purchase power maintain sustainable high employment. in order deliver mandate, ecb do great deal support euro area economy. first, reduce main interest rate historic low 0.5%. second, introduce series measure ensure bank pas low interest rate borrower real economy. these measure include allow bank borrow much liquidity ecb need; expand range collateral use access liquidity; intervene bond market malfunctioning, like sovereign bond market cover bond market; launch two three-year long-term refinance operation (ltros), inject 1 trillion euro euro area bank system. overall, balance sheet increase 1.5 trillion euro crisis 3 trillion euro peak. 2 bi central bankers’ speech our measure primarily focus bank because, euro area, bank lend main channel firm household get access finance. around three quarter firms’ external finance come banks, compare around one quarter unite states. support bank system therefore essential support growth euro area – fulfil mandate maintain price stability. more recently, ecb act remove unfounded fear future integrity monetary union. these fear create severe turbulence financial market prevent low interest rate reach country need most. a result, saw risk widespread credit crunch countries. question fiscal sustainability grow market distrust start spill respective bank sectors. the effect growth employment would severe. indeed, investor suddenly lose confidence euro area could survive current composition. the prospect claim government private company certain country could discharge euro become possibility. our response introduce programme outright monetary transaction (omt), allow ex ante unlimited intervention sovereign debt markets. omt effective restore market function trust euro area. for example, since omt announcement, bond market steadied, provide discipline without become destructive. spread long-term bond spain, italy ireland decline around 150–250 basis points, portugal almost 500 basis points. and help reduce financial fragmentation within euro area, show best indicator fragmentation, level target balances. these decline 285 billion euros, 25%, since peak last year. france, like member states, benefit significantly stabilisation. in short, ecb active respond crisis. we robustly defend stability monetary union therefore money. and stand ready act needed. however, important acknowledge limit monetary policy achieve. this question scope mandate. it fundamentally different institution empower do. one pertinent example current shortage credit many household small- medium-sized enterprises. credit provision require funding, capital positive risk assessment. the central bank help ensure fund address macroeconomic risk. but cannot provide capital, affect banks’ assessment creditworthiness individual borrowers. similarly, monetary policy cannot create real economic growth. if growth stall economy produce enough firm lose competitiveness, beyond power central bank fix. yet, euro area need sustainable growth. there currently 19 million people unemployed euro area. almost quarter young people work. such high level joblessness tragedy. moreover, weak economy mean few taxpayer low revenues. this put pressure public finances, ultimately social models. so best way achieve growth europe needs? let turn issue share reflection subject. bi central bankers’ speech 3 growth adjustment euro area some euro area country past rely debt support growth fund social spending. but path lead difficult situation today. they end high public debt growth steadily fallen. in country, instance, public debt rise around 20% gdp 1980 90% gdp today. in time, annual gdp growth average 2.3% 1980s, 1.9% 1990s, 1.8% 2000s crisis. this suggest that, euro area countries, new approach needed. an approach deliver growth jobs, sustain social models, without create unsustainable debt burden future generations. in view, require two complementary responses. the first response ensure fiscal consolidation, necessary contain debt levels, make growth-friendly possible. for instance, rely le tax increase would help sustain citizens’ disposable income. prioritise capital investment current spend would lay foundation future growth. structural fiscal reforms, example pension systems, would also help support fiscal sustainability without negative effect economy today. the second response raise competitiveness increase underlie productive capacity economies. here, frontier reform target structure economy. these include reduce barrier entry new firm young people, remove burden business like complex tax labour law distortionary regulations. reform labour market also essential create high possible opportunity employment. we already see progress rebalancing euro area: unit labour cost come country grow excessively; current account deficit narrow large imbalance past; export growth generally pick country strain. but many euro area countries, gap wage productivity still line competitiveness. to increase employment, gap close many policy lever contribute used. change two-tier employment system protect insider harm outsider one lever. let u forget suffer unreformed labour market often young people, evidence high level youth employment today. i therefore welcome joint initiative french german labour minister tackle issue. this underscore important point reforms: restore competitiveness create opportunity wide range people, benefit many, few. reform expression solidarity citizens. solidarity across country also important, would meaningless without solidarity within countries. build strong emu what role euro area whole play support growth stability across europe? government today reflect deeply question. they consider miss original design economic monetary union (emu): responsibility need share european level, not, make emu function effectively. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in view, debate drive single question: best protect vital interest euro area citizens? and answer involve transfer sovereignty european level, hesitate so. the best example bank union. bank union essential ensure make permanent progress make reintegrate financial markets; financial condition core periphery country return normal; monetary union become truly single again. it two indispensable elements: strong single supervisory mechanism (ssm) strong single resolution mechanism (srm). a strong system common supervision key increase confidence health euro area banks, damage due supervisory failure past. progress already well underway here, single supervisory mechanism take supervision one year legislation adopted. but ensure common supervision credible, need accompany mechanism wind fail bank without cause financial instability. this need single resolution mechanism. and need strong european dimension able deal effectively large, cross-border banks. but bank union example close union needed. ultimately, euro area need draw close field economic policy. the recent call leader france germany close economic union show message understood. but important form fully align substance. in view, true economic union mean three things. first, mean every country ensure national economy function properly, without external imbalance high unemployment. we cannot strong economic union without strong national economies. second, mean transfer sovereignty decision-making european level – accept decision make good euro area whole, even if, moment time, individual country may disagree them. third, mean apply rule member monetary union. this condition fairness countries, also pre-condition deep integration. only trust member play rule union mutual solidarity become possible. for reasons, move towards close economic union also require equivalent deepen political union. great authority european level must match great democratic legitimacy. and european parliament national parliament key role play. a herman van rompuy remind us, national parliament become eu institutions. conclusion let conclude. the euro area make much progress recent years, still face many challenges. solve require eu institution national government work concert. the ecb do much stabilise market support economy. now government parliament need raise growth potential, strengthen competitiveness build stronger, stable emu. bi central bankers’ speech 5 i impress learn that, back 1871, victor hugo call assembly unite state europe. france today equally ambitious take euro area forward. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas jordan: challenge economic financial condition swiss bank sector introductory remark mr thomas jordan, chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 20 june 2013. * * * the swiss national bank (snb) maintain minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro. the swiss franc still high. an appreciation swiss franc would compromise price stability would serious consequence swiss economy. in current environment, minimum exchange rate remain important order avoid undesirable tighten monetary condition switzerland event sudden upward pressure swiss franc. we stand ready enforce minimum exchange rate, necessary, buy foreign currency unlimited quantities, take measures, required. the target range three-month libor leave unchanged 0.0–0.25%. since march, snb’s conditional inflation forecast remain almost unchanged, apart inflation current year, slightly low due reduction oil price. the forecast base unchanged three-month libor 0.0% next three years. for 2013, anticipate slightly low inflation –0.3%. for 2014, inflation forecast unchanged 0.2% 2015 0.7%. consequently, inflation switzerland remain low foreseeable future. in first quarter 2013, global economy weak expected. the recession continue euro area. in us, recovery remain hesitant china, economic activity lose strength. in switzerland, real gdp rise significantly first quarter. however, expect perceptible weaken growth second quarter. overall, still anticipate growth 1.0–1.5% 2013. the risk swiss economy remain high. they continue originate, part, international environment. a weaken global economic momentum cannot excluded. further development euro area financial sovereign debt crisis remain uncertain. tension reappear moment global financial markets. domestically, risk imbalance mortgage real estate market grow, give sustain period exceptionally low interest rates. global economic outlook i would like outline outlook global economy switzerland detail. i look monetary financial condition snb’s monetary policy. in first quarter, growth global economy weak expected, across board. in many emerge markets, particularly china, economic activity lose strength. in euro area, recession continued, us, recovery remain hesitant. the advance economy gain significant momentum japan. however, quarter ahead, global growth likely firm gradually. in us, recovery support labour market rise asset prices. in japan, expansionary economic policy invigorate effect. due upturn world trade improvement finance conditions, euro area also likely emerge gradually recession. in addition, burden impose budget consolidation low next year. overall, however, outlook remain uncertain. the risk deterioration global economy continue high. a before, big risk remain renew deterioration euro area financial sovereign debt crisis. even though baseline scenario 2 bi central bankers’ speech assume gradual solution crisis, possible tension could re-emerge financial market time. swiss economic outlook in switzerland, economy experience temporary revival first quarter, expected, real gdp rise 2.3%, annualised terms. thus, experience favourable growth neighbour countries. the difference primarily attributable domestic demand. once again, growth mainly drive private consumption investment residential construction. these demand component benefit relatively robust labour market, continue strong inflow immigrant favourable finance conditions. in particular, supply credit switzerland currently much strong effect real economy european countries. in case exports, however, indication last revival. since begin 2011, real export move sideways. they hold back high value swiss franc, also subdue momentum world trade. moreover, investment swiss company hesitant. one reason uncertainty development global economy. however, factor dampen investment activity pressure profit margin continue overcapacity part manufacture industry. accord information derive quarterly survey carry snb regional delegates, cautious approach persist near future. this mean domestic equipment investment 2013 probably stagnate. on output side, too, development mix first quarter. construction, banking, insurance health record clearly positive growth figures. in manufacturing, business activity merely stabilised. in area, situation metal process machine industries, particular, remain difficult. both industry suffer weak industrial activity lack investment demand part company many european countries. most recently, growth employment slowed, unemployment rise somewhat, seasonally-adjusted terms. we expect unemployment figure increase marginally end year. for second quarter, forecast perceptible weaken growth compare strong first quarter. in follow quarters, recovery global economy strengthens, economic momentum likely increase gradually again. we continue expect growth 1.0–1.5% year 2013 whole. consequently, expect swiss economy return full utilisation production capacity near future. monetary financial condition i turn monetary financial conditions. in recent weeks, volatility financial market increased. since last monetary policy assessment, however, export-weighted external value swiss franc remain largely unchanged. recent development suggest safe-haven consideration continue play important role demand swiss francs. overall, value swiss franc remain high fall next quarters. the level interest rate switzerland remain low first quarter. on secure swiss franc money market, interest rate negative territory. yield issue confederation money market debt register claim also continue negative. by contrast, yield ten-year confederation bond rise slightly low reach last december. movement long-term interest rate show demand secure investment bi central bankers’ speech 3 react strongly international environment. my colleague, fritz zurbrügg, talk development financial market detail afterwards. banks’ sight deposit snb increase since september 2012. however, growth m1, m2 m3 monetary aggregates, measure amount money hold household companies, remain strong. this growth money accompany robust lend part banks. although rate growth mortgage loan household decline since mid-2012, still high level. most recently, mortgage lend companies, particular residential construction, increase significantly. overall, lend grow fast nominal gdp several years. in addition, price owner-occupied apartment single-family home rise strongly past years. give sustain period exceptionally low interest rates, risk imbalance mortgage real estate market increase further. this development jeopardise financial stability and, event abrupt correction, wide-reaching consequence real economy. snb monetary policy lady gentlemen, snb continue face major challenges. in particular, threat swiss franc could suddenly come upward pressure averted. in current low interest rate environment, therefore, minimum exchange rate remain focal instrument ensure appropriate monetary conditions. the financial crisis show balance economic development price stability required; financial stability must also guaranteed. in switzerland, fact snb require contribute ensure financial stability already lay national bank act 2004. our annual financial stability report important instrument respect. it draw attention emerge imbalance existence risk which, view, could jeopardise stability bank industry whole medium term. in addition, last year new instrument create – countercyclical capital buff – base lesson draw financial crisis. at begin year, snb propose buff activated, federal council decide favour activation february. the countercyclical capital buff come effect end september 2013 strengthen resilience bank industry. moreover, help counter build-up imbalance mortgage real estate markets. my colleague, jean-pierre danthine, give assessment risk financial sector. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fritz zurbrügg: a snapshot financial situation switzerland introductory remark mr fritz zurbrügg, member govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 20 june 2013. * * * i begin today situation financial markets. then i address management currency reserves, move trend money market, well current discussion regard reference interest rates. finally, i say word future repo market infrastructure switzerland. development financial market in december, last news conference, i remark ease tension financial markets. this ease largely continue first half 2013. the government bond european peripheral countries, particular, benefit great trust investors, ireland portugal raise fund via long-term bond capital market first time since 2010 2011, respectively. the buoyant mood financial market also demonstrate advance economies’ stock markets. in may, new historical high us, uk switzerland. investors’ risk appetite encourage least expansionary monetary policy around world. various central banks, include european central bank (ecb), reduce key interest rate early year. the prospect low yield bond market induce many investor increase equity investments. in japan, monetary policy announcement result significantly improve investor sentiment, nikkei stock index climb 80% november 2012 may 2013 back strongly depreciate yen ensue high profit expectation japanese companies. in positive risk climate, investment perceive secure lose value. a prominent example gold: the dollar price per fine ounce gold rise 2011 high usd 1,900. currently, approximately quarter lower. government bond perceive secure also fall value, even though yield still low. this also apply confederation bonds. while yield ten-year confederation bonds, example, significantly increase since low point last december, around 0.8% still extremely low. movement swiss franc exchange rate match risk-friendly market environment. since january, euro/swiss franc exchange rate move away minimum rate chf 1.20, times, value record last see spring 2011, words, introduction minimum exchange rate. on trade-weighted basis, however, swiss franc remain largely unchanged since begin year. the favourable development financial markets, persist lengthy period, result reduction extreme risks. this due, one hand, measure take ecb, other, fact that, us, ‘fiscal cliff’ averted. a recent week shown, condition financial market change swiftly. in japan, sharp correction stock market yen gain somewhat value. meanwhile, euro area, discrepancy generally favourable trend financial market disappoint economic data. finally, us, certain degree uncertainty future monetary policy direction federal reserve (fed) gain ground. overall, market 2 bi central bankers’ speech environment continue dominate high level uncertainty, thereby remain susceptible sudden shift mood. management currency reserve the ease tension financial market also affect swiss national bank’s (snb) currency reserves. these mainly compose foreign currency investment gold. at end may, snb hold foreign currency investment chf 440 billion (cf. chart 1). due liquidity security requirements, large portion foreign exchange hold government bond deposit central banks. this portion amount 78% end first quarter 2013. to diversify investment risk increase investment real assets, raise proportion equity 12% 15% first quarter. we currently hold equity worth around chf 65 billion, three time end 2011. in regard, widen scope include share company relatively small market capitalisation, well advance economy previously considered, result equity portfolio cover advance economies. since invest relatively little new markets, currency allocation hardly change recent months. the proportion gold currency reserve amount 10% end first quarter 2013. from investment viewpoint, gold important good diversification currency reserves. historically, gold often move opposite direction assets. in contrast equity bonds, however, gold yield interest dividends. and recent month shown, gold also among volatile therefore risky investments, noteworthy example occur april, gold price fell 15% le week. last december, snb announce would open branch office singapore. this enable u efficiently manage foreign currency investments, rise sharply, expand market coverage asia, position close key market participants. singapore one significant trade centre bond asia. at time, branch office singapore facilitate enforcement minimum exchange rate. it open july, staff seven. the singapore office concern trading; settlement continue take place zurich. the branch office completely subordinate exist snb oversight control. swiss franc money market reference interest rate the continue high level swiss franc liquidity desire effect keep money market interest rate close zero. the three-month libor around two basis point since mid-january. interest rate expectations, base libor future contracts, also close zero foreseeable future, negative, case much last year. a result low money market interest rate high liquidity bank sector, money market turnover drop substantially recent years. this illustrate chart 2, show total banks’ sight deposit snb, well turnover area secure unsecured call money. the small number transaction money market problem generate representative reference interest rates. in addition, selection set reference interest rate come scrutiny market participant public, consequence libor manipulation. a regard problem surround libor, effort reform underway international level. to ensure continuation libor, raft measure already initiated. these include improve regulatory framework libor fixing, well enforce oversight relevant authorities. the aim make libor representative restore trust market participants. aside regulatory bi central bankers’ speech 3 steps, also vital continue existence libor adequate number bank participate libor fixing, money market upon libor fix base recover importance. credible representative reference interest rate major importance financial markets. they serve benchmark price loans, financial product derivatives. in switzerland, approximately 80% bank use libor benchmark loans, especially mortgages. the responsibility provision reference interest rate therefore lie primarily market participants. they aware responsibility, become involved, necessary, explore alternative reference interest rates. the snb play supportive role regard, participate discussion market participants, well swiss foreign authorities. future repo market infrastructure switzerland with regard repo market infrastructure, important well prepare future. a functioning, secure efficient repo market vital implementation monetary policy, well market participants’ access central bank liquidity. switzerland long tradition organise core financial market infrastructure joint enterprise, accord ‘user-owned, user-governed’ principle. in case repo market, current solution prove worth. nonetheless, due change stock market regulatory environment, snb undertake reassessment situation. in light this, snb decide conduct monetary policy operation via new trade platform, provide six group ltd, may 2014. in way, repo market base integrate solution, trade platform, security settlement system payment system cover single source. moreover, development also possible, example expansion trade incorporate products. since new trade platform resemble exist swiss franc repo system (eurex repo), access market participant entail minimal adjustments. we confident integrate solution best mean ensure robust repo market infrastructure. 4 bi central bankers’ speech chart bi central bankers’ speech 1 jörg asmussen: the global crisis – lesson international policy cooperation speech mr jörg asmussen, member executive board european central bank, kiel institute world economy, kiel, 23 june 2013. * * * sehr geehrter herr ministerpräsident, sehr geehrte frau oberbürgermeisterin, sehr geehrter herr professor snower, dear laureates, meine damen und herren, it pleasure today kiel warmly congratulate gro harlem brundtland, joseph stiglitz mohammed ibrahim win 2013 global economy prize. this prize high reputation ecb believe international cooperation openness crucial improve people’s standard living. some might recall prize award 2011 former ecb president jean-claude trichet. i would like focus intervention today lesson draw global financial crisis international policy cooperation. i start question. doe crisis call substantial change approach international policy cooperation? my answer yes, follow three reasons: first, world become interconnect shock transmit rapidly across countries. consider follow figure global financial integration: total foreign asset liability advance economy rise 68% gdp 1980 almost 450% gdp 2010. the synchronisation severe economic financial downturn, failure major financial institution 2008, stark reminder significant interdependence economies. in 2009, 40 50 large economy world experience severe recessions. second, need new approach international cooperation potential source shock multiplied. alongside domestic shocks, country expose past external financial shock global shock confidence. keep one’s “house order” long sufficient fully insulate domestic economy shocks. third, need new approach international cooperation crisis unveil structural vulnerability global economy. in particular, current institution design economic system 20th century. they suitable global challenge 21st century. global economic cooperation need design good institutions. for three reasons, take crisis serious opportunity tune global policy make today’s interconnect world. the stake high, economic social cost crisis large. unemployment, especially youth unemployment, significantly increase since 2008. a many 73 million young people estimate unemployed globally 2013, especially advance economy – include euro area – middle east north africa. would reverse globalisation solve problem? 2 bi central bankers’ speech my answer no. be northern germany today, long tradition openness free trade ever since many city along baltic coast join hanseatic league, stark reminder benefit global european integration. and perhaps case germany show benefit even clearly: • the share germany global export stand around 8% 2012. this make germany large global exporter china (10%) u (9.8%). • export good service germany rest eu increase around 20% german gdp 2000, around 30% gdp 2012. • export germany rest world increase around 30% gdp 2000 50 % gdp 2012. protectionism would clearly harm germany europe. therefore, turn back globalisation. we rather learn good reap benefit make inclusive, way benefit also fairly shared. the crisis offer opportunity learn past mistakes. at domestic level, show importance address imbalance sound policy structural reforms. at global level, show real cost non-cooperative attitude policies. it therefore call substantial change institutional governance framework international policy cooperation. let first identify past mistake consider main vulnerability unveil crisis, global european level. on global front, crisis mainly reveal existence global economic governance failure weak surveillance mechanisms. global imbalance lead accumulation fragility global financial system unsustainable global macroeconomic outcomes. for example, long term interest rate u globally respond expect federal reserve tighten cycle start 2004. this unusual behaviour long term interest rates, reflect global save glut, label “conundrum” federal reserve chairman alan greenspan. persistently low long-term interest rate lead aggressive search yield capital misallocations financial system. how impact domestic policy could spill country sufficiently appreciated. and need strong international cooperation front recognise much crisis either. in 2007 imf attempt broaden focus bilateral surveillance implication domestic policy external sustainability. the attempt fail country resist exchange rate label “fundamentally misaligned” adjust policy accordingly. a forum global economic governance tune economic reality 21st century missing. institutional framework create sufficient peer pressure global level prompt systemic player act weak. thus, global economic governance multilateral surveillance fully equip new challenge globalise world. but crisis also reveal acute failure global financial system. while financial sector become increasingly international, supervision regulation remain largely national scope loosely coordinate international level. this encourage regulatory arbitrage, creation large, complex financial intermediaries, poor risk management practises. several feature also characterise european continent. the crisis reveal fragility governance, surveillance framework financial architecture euro area. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the rule governance framework associate stability growth pact sufficiently enforce and, therefore, respected. effort promote structural reforms, example lisbon agenda, weak. a know well, macroeconomic imbalance within euro area grow unabated. competitiveness development across member state diverge unsustainable extent. for instance, harmonise indicator price competitiveness show 2000 2008 germany become almost 20% competitive real term vis-à-vis rest euro area average. over period, price competitiveness decrease around 10% italy spain vis-à-vis euro area average. in addition, despite unprecedented level financial integration euro area, bank supervision remain domestic. cross-border resolution frameworks, turn, reflect increase complexity interconnectedness european bank system. overall, inappropriate policy one country euro area could create negative externality euro area countries, possibly destabilise monetary union whole. the crisis hence reveal euro area need much strong mechanism correct inappropriate domestic policies. it also reveal euro area’s ability absorb shocks, especially asymmetric ones, framework crisis management resolution need significantly strengthened. what do far address global european vulnerability reveal crisis? let start global perspective. economic governance surveillance mechanism strengthen appreciably. the g20 upgrade leaders’ level, replace g7 premier forum international economic cooperation. this make governance encompass legitimate. the g20 represent 65% world population (including eu), g7 represent slightly 10% it. the key emerge market economy table. the first three g20 leaders’ summit (washington, london pittsburgh) lead important achievements, include coordinate policy response cyclical downturn, solemn commitment keep global economy open resource imf. the g20 also give political impetus broad agenda financial reform make global financial system stable resilient. work way different forum fill regulatory gaps, make regulation consistent across countries, limit possibility arbitrage, improve supervision cross-border institution facilitate resolution. the crisis also lead radical change european institutional governance framework. in little le four years, create european stability mechanism (esm), permanent crisis resolution mechanism euro area. we also strengthen euro area economic governance, instance “fiscal compact” macroeconomic imbalance procedure. the creation single supervisory mechanism (ssm) ecb also way. it make supervision consistent level bank integration europe. these essential element need break adverse feedback loop bank sovereigns. what need do finish job make global economic financial system stable resilient reap benefit globalisation fully? we still long way go, admittedly, still time rest laurels. let hence sketch issue remain unsolved. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the global reform agenda lose momentum, sense urgency impose crisis vanished. on global financial reform front, instance, progress slow several respects. this generate frustration lead country-specific regulatory initiatives. these initiative create market distortions, harm global european financial integration lead regulatory arbitrage. progress front global economic policy-making also slow down. the g20’s effectiveness questioned. be large g7, also heterogeneous term value represent interests. therefore, reach agreement negotiation table challenging. also, g20 might appear distant citizens, helpful legitimacy, latter intrinsically link local proximity. finally, country table. an entire continent like africa represent one country, namely south africa. despite limitations, g20 remain essential global economic cooperation insofar obvious alternative. return g7 g8 option. at time, premature conclude former format dead rise g20. the conclusion week’s g8 summit northern-ireland fight tax evasion world trade example show small format stimulate important momentum g20 forum like wto. where stand european front? an essential lesson crisis economic monetary union incomplete project. the “four presidents” report outline necessary step move towards genuine monetary union, i strongly support. first, need complete great urgency bank union. we need clear transparent assessment condition bank system (“asset review”) single supervisory mechanism take over. we also need strong commitment towards effective single resolution mechanism (srm) indispensable element bank union necessary complement ssm. the srm would allow smooth wind banks, especially large cross-border activities. it need entail strong single resolution authority (sra) well single resolution fund (srf). the latter finance ex-ante risk base levy bank sector. these arrangement would enhance credibility system ultimately break link bank sovereigns. second, need strengthen integrate economic governance framework make economy competitive resilient asymmetric shocks. one front european governance greatly improve relate structural reforms. ultimately, structural reform benefit many expense few. a recent oecd report call “double dividend” structural reforms: increase growth, implement properly, decrease inequality. one way create incentive member state engage structural reform could provision temporary financial assistance alleviate short-term cost reforms, exchange contractual agreement complete them. the contract would entail clear goal line eu policy measurable targets. these contract could useful several instances, especially presence “reform bailout fatigue”, constrain public finances. third, increase level integration within europe call new institutional design ensure legitimation, accountability democratic control. on one hand, government ensure national parliament appropriately inform involve decision processes. on hand, national parliament often best position incorporate eu common interest decisions. therefore, european institution strengthened, particular european parliament could maybe also bi central bankers’ speech 5 convene euro area format. this would ensure level accountability match level decision taken. it time conclude, globalisation lift poverty improve live standard million around world. it greatly benefit germany rest europe. it benefit emerge asia. and benefit large part africa. we reverse globalisation. we rather elevate game adapt toolkit new reality 21st century. this enable u reap full benefit globalisation share gain fairly. strong international policy cooperation would help deliver stronger, sustainable balance growth globally. it best mean avoid currency wars. it would help make growth inclusive decrease unemployment, especially among youth. it would increase peer pressure, thereby improve governance, especially develop countries. strong international policy cooperation would also help make growth model compatible scarcity natural resource environmental constraints. the crisis offer opportunity learn past mistakes. this opportunity go wasted. a sense urgency impose crisis vanishes, risk complacency slow reforms, road lie front u still long. but decision complete global reform agenda enhance international cooperation entirely hands. this i believe kiel prize global economy reminder u importance globalisation international cooperation. therefore, i want conclude warm congratulation winner prize. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mervyn king: a governor look back – forward speech mr mervyn king, governor bank england, lord mayor’s banquet banker merchant city london, london, 19 june 2013. * * * my lord mayor, lady gentlemen: chancellor: thank generous words. it privilege work past three years, period great change home abroad. your support bank much appreciate end town, change good regulatory framework oversee city. but know past year would much difficult without continual support two people. and i please france barbara u tonight. and i’m particularly happy, george, neither i speak either experience suggest would suffer comparison. lord mayor: let thank preside final mansion house dinner. we enjoy many musical even together, barbara i look forward share many clare shed chain office late year. the city extremely fortunate benefit energy, drive can-do attitude lord mayor. i shall detain even retrospective examination time governor. suffice say game two halves. and, far bore goalless draw, turn rather excite dramatic game, full incident, red card two passionate time justifiably angry crowd. we shall wait historian tomorrow file full match report. instead, tonight i want focus twin challenge engineer recovery reform financial system. i want look back huge amount done, look forward unfinished business fronts, much bank england. i shall also tell story governor bank england, governor bank canada certain mr osborne. but come later. since 2008, bank’s monetary policy committee go extraordinary length stabilise economy support growth employment. in fact, pursue i call “paradox policy”: short run, encourage spend unprecedentedly loose monetary policy, opposite need long run, raise national saving. but necessary prevent even bad recession, without similar action central bank world might experience major depression. now clear sign recovery uk, albeit modest, underway. from begin year, business survey improved, broad money growth stabilise around 5% year, house market pick up. despite encourage picture, growth yet strong enough reduce considerable margin spare capacity economy. nor recovery adequate rate fully assured. the weakness euro area problem uk bank system continue act drag growth. so need support recovery remains. of course must mindful risk inject money economy. we cannot afford return inflationary episode past. in two decade inflation target introduce 1992, inflation average almost 10% year. the purpose inflation target change way interest rate decision make build credibility uk’s commitment price stability. over follow two decades, cpi inflation average fraction 2%. today, inflation 2% target – past five years. but economy absorb 2 bi central bankers’ speech oil price shock par 1970s, well sharp depreciation sterling. and yet sign domestically generate inflation, remain close 2%.1 pay rise underlie inflationary pressure low, medium-term outlook inflation fall back target. inflation target achieve objective. the great risk present that, next years, unemployment remain unnecessarily high. we must forget one million people work five year crisis. it soon say job secure recovery complete. there powerful case stimulus short run. the present extraordinary monetary policy cannot, however, continue indefinitely. both nominal real interest rate unsustainably low levels. there understandable yearn return normality. and recent week bond yield rise – around 45 basis point since start may. but market move confuse return normality. a rapid return high interest rate would great damage balance sheet highly indebted households, company and, especially, financial institutions. the challenge return normality much manage market expectation eventually happens, important though is, create economic condition sensible return normal level interest rates. the real challenge – global scale – rebalance world economy low interest rate require exhort deficit country spend order absorb surplus elsewhere. monetary policy cannot provide answer. it buy time bring

scale adjustment ultimately needed. it inevitably bumpy ride. the obstacle return normality bank system where, despite generous provision liquidity fund state, lend remain lacklustre, risk premia high. although combine balance sheet large bank shrink since height crisis 2008, still 400% annual gdp. leverage ratio fallen, major bank remain highly leveraged. and course two big lender domestic economy remain largely state ownership. it difficult imagine bank sector like make real contribution economic recovery. it must time decisive action. chancellor, make clear tonight embrace view. britain need thrive bank system serve household businesses, lloyd rb able play role full back private sector. i welcome announcement lloyd bank group return private hand soon. and i much support plan full review future structure rbs. the return bank supervision bank england also see decisive actions. the financial policy committee (fpc) new prudential regulation authority (pra) act quickly make bank system resilient. in march, fpc recommend banks’ capital assess use prudent estimate expect loss risk weights. since april, board pra make assessment ask bank take action deal shortfall capital. that work complete, bank know results, tomorrow publish major banks. in total, eight large bank capital shortfall around £25bn relative standard recommend fpc. after exercise, major bank plan action fill shortfall. the first evidence announcement 1 a measure rate increase gdp deflator. bi central bankers’ speech 3 monday co-operative bank. others follow. by take firm pre-emptive action, show new judgement-led approach supervision mean practice. it substitute substance process judgement box-ticking. we need good regulation and, monetary policy, change way regulatory decision made. the pra announcement tomorrow another step deal legacy past. it make bank system resilient good able support recovery. but soon say job done. many major lender still highly levered. the level capital require vickers reforms, one hand, basel standard large international banks, other, mean clearly way go claim really well-capitalised bank system. in future, fpc pra work together conduct regular stress test banks, start 2014. those stress test i sure make public, bank expect set plan make identify shortfall capital. manage process, transition high level capital, key task fpc pra come years. those argue require high level capital necessarily restrict lend wrong. the reverse true. it insufficient capital restrict lending. that weak bank shrink balance sheets. capital support lend provide resilience. and, without resilient bank system, difficult sustain recovery. although high capital restrict lending, requirement hold liquid asset do. every pound additional hold liquid asset pound could otherwise lend real economy. that bank stand ready, special liquidity scheme, new discount window facility, market operation (including ectr) fund lend scheme, provide backstop liquidity need bank system – adequate collateral appropriate interest rate. give backstop, fpc past year recommend regulatory requirement hold liquid asset loosened. the bank’s provision liquidity bank system transform recognition past six years. but unfinished business. we ask bill winter review system make recommendation changes. we review proposal soon take step expand regular auction wide pool collateral make discount window facility cheap easily accessible. all policy action put economy position recovery. but must also ensure financial system truly reform way reflect lesson financial crisis. at dinner six year ago, crisis began, i said, “excessive leverage common theme many financial crisis past. be really much clever financier past?” we much wise now. and country claim vanguard learn lessons. much done. but cannot complacent. a memory crisis fade, saw first hand retire, vital ‘audacity pessimism’ lost. we must deal problem financial institution big, important, fail. some progress made. when crisis hit, uk neither effective deposit insurance scheme resolution framework deal fail banks. now both. but unfinished business. although uk lead way development agreement among regulator worldwide large bank could resolved, manage cross-border resolution still fraught difficulty. we also need implement proposal independent commission bank soon possible, include ‘ring-fence’ separate commercial investment banking, leverage ratio. a situation taxpayer bear burden bank fail 4 bi central bankers’ speech unacceptable. that implicit guarantee costly distort competition. the unite kingdom simply cannot afford international bank centre taxpayer underwrite balance sheet many multiple gdp. too important fail important ignore. the economics bank changing, city opportunity adapt lead new form bank emerge. the strength city london always base two qualities: ability adapt new circumstances, truly global perspective. that stand u good stead now. but future bank depend change leverage also great degree responsibility involved: leader banks, regulator consumers. we must restore trust bank system. today’s substantial authoritative report parliamentary commission bank standard important landmark map path goal. change ethic culture bank precondition restore trust. a commission’s report shows, sheer size complexity global bank lead failure governance. governments, regulators, prosecutor non-executive director struggle come term firm pose risk taxpayers, cannot prosecute systemic importance, difficult manage size complexity. it national interest bank big fail, big jail, simply big. solve problem work generation, i hope financial community rise challenge shrink it. the city whole merit trust. and, historian look back period many year now, conclude although wise financier past, learn reformed, country benefit prosper result. a i leave scene, undoubtedly much unfinished business successor. i delight mark carney next governor. he bring new generation leadership bank, well enormous experience time central bank governor role steer financial stability board. he wholehearted best wish term governor. mark is, however, first canadian frame governorship bank england. the first governor bank canada, graham towers, put forward keynes successor montagu norman. the propose transfer fell – apparently director bank view canadian ‘too keynesian’. what tell u view monetary activism i know. but perhaps worth note towers’ first deputy governor mr. osborne, agree move canada bank england spell ‘up 5 years’. sadly, partnership canadian governor mr. osborne last three years, latter departed. but, chancellor, remember history doesn’t always repeat itself. in britain, especially city, always welcome talent around world academic, business, artistic sport life. why central bank different? george, congratulate mark’s appointment. i shall course sad leave. but governor come governor go – institutions, idea embody, matter more. i leave behind strong, independent, much-changed bank focus two main responsibilities. the lesson recent year learn u remember them. the test monetary arrangement see work successfully new leadership, none present creation. no doubt thing change. no doubt thing need change. after one change institution order set concrete. a successful institution, like city whole, always adapt new circumstances. i know bank continue mark’s leadership. mark inherit wealth young talent bank, lead three outstanding deputy governors: charlie bean, andrew bi central bankers’ speech 5 bailey and, course, paul tucker, make enormous

return triumph mansion house land rover. a city face challenge turn disaster triumph, would well follow example “treat two imposter same”. roger, commitment promotion creative industry – crucial this, excite city world – well opportunity children, aspire musicians, even tree bicycles, well known. and u tonight would like pay tribute lord mayor, thank lady mayoress, clare, yourself, roger, splendid hospitality you’ve extend u evening. so i invite rise join traditional toast good health prosperity “the lord mayor lady mayoress, roger clare gifford”. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: the financial future region speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, summit finance minister governor “the financial future region”, becici, montenegro, 14 june 2013. * * * dear minister finance, dear governors, the crisis go through, profound lasting, leave mark economics general, central bank particular. up great recession, monetary policy live world may call “the inflation target era”. to anyone follow discussion regard optimal central bank policy ever since onset crisis, clear validity previous approach heavily questioned. in many way inflation target make central bank’s job simple, long follow policy correctly. the central bank, see public independent institution, credibly commit explicit inflation target, order anchor mid-term inflation expectations. self-fulfilling expectation economic agent price setter would, turn, help deliver objective monetary policy. unfortunately, show recently, strict approach monetary policy shortcomings. what approach missed, due focus consumer prices, drift price asset general. escalate asset price sudden burst affect significantly behaviour balance sheet economic agent challenge stability financial system. in respect, concept financial stability see product monetary stability. economist believe stabilize consumer prices, financial asset would also behave stable predictable way. the crisis painfully remind u that: necessarily true. behaviour financial market always rational lack confidence market spiral control, send shockwaves throughout economy. fortunately, bank albania adopt conservative approach consider monetary policy financial stability issue simultaneously, condition either decision-making process one. due behaviour, crisis direct trivial impact financial system. despite this, bank system face immediate difficulty form deposit withdrawals, emerge indirect effect fear contagion irrational expectations. the liquidity problem emerge spill credit market late real economy foreign sector. the bank albania react quickly change economic climate. liquidity abundantly inject bank stringent regulation apply regard transfer funds. however, unlike country monetary policy use initially boost aggregate demand, albania, monetary policy stay course give way expansionary fiscal policy. due relatively long period consolidation, fiscal policy outburst crisis abundant room manoeuvre direct impact economy. our policy response condition concern financial stability, assume interest rate cut would speed deposit withdrawal bank system. bank albania take bold decisive step control problem restore credibility bank system. a effect fiscal stimulus begin phase 2 bi central bankers’ speech confidence restore bank system, reduce policy rate historic low order provide stimulus economy. more importantly, supervision bank system enhance establish thoroughly new department financial stability bring financial stability issue decision-making process monetary policy. a result, set tool available bank albania extend include several macro-prudential measures, aim address simultaneously economic growth financial stability concerns. i believe similar step take central bank around world. willingly not, objective financial stability see central duty institutions. it matter whether legal mandate central bank amend include new objective not. what matter financial stability prerequisite overall macroeconomic stability monetary stability. the challenge lie ahead u include new objective policy making; whether inflation target financial stability combine whether new regime altogether needed. various new radical approach mention far. however, i believe discard hard-learned lesson success past. stabilize inflation something central banker may proud of, something cherish continue strive for. incorporate financial stability objective inflation target regime see opportunity understand economic development potential macro-financial risks, achieve objective preserve long-run economic stability. i believe course monetary policy continue extensively discuss future, include improve understand role asset price financial frictions. under current conditions, large central bank develop country stretch central bank theory practice beyond traditional activities. their balance sheet increase beyond imagination and, cases, include private assets; accept much broad role assume responsibility. this new untested type central bank strong impact nature monetary policy interaction central bank objective also independence credibility central bank itself. the nature future monetary policy largely depend success large central bank get situation control timely manner, without cause excess inflation damage central bank hard-earned credibility. these development affect monetary policy emerge market interest exchange rates, importantly way central bank conduct monetary policy. influence current practice lead central banks, central bank reorient objective engage activity traditional development bank governments. we careful stay away adopt target objective monetary policy also macro-prudential policy. the bank albania traditionally base policy two important pillars. our first focus achieve inflation target manage inflation expectation preserve purchase power currency. this policy simultaneously provide necessary stimulus economic activity. second, focus bank supervision financial stability enhance confidence financial system therefore increase efficiency credibility monetary policy. a i say april 2008, annual conference bank system albania, “every investment make today financial stability yield increase efficiency monetary policy”. bi central bankers’ speech 3 recently, bank albania introduce financial literacy third pillar policy independence. this objective found belief first two pillar gain sustainability public understand role central bank, independence policy. last equally important, i would like emphasise need cooperation coordination fiscal policy. fiscal policy impact fact life can’t ignored. therefore, monetary macro-prudential policy design implement full awareness existence. a central bank live isolate island; success will, among others, depend ability act coordination cooperation fiscal policy, without lose independence. incorporate understand central bank theory practice require adjustment flexibility but, time, require central bank preserve focus independence acknowledge limitations. altogether change allow central bank inflation target regime become useful tool hand monetary authority preserve economic financial stability post-global financial crisis period. thank much attention! bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: eu integration – key challenge cesee country speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, conference “interlinkages euro area long-term convergence dynamics”, host european central bank, frankfurt, 17 june 2013. * * * mr. chairman, lady gentleman, dear colleagues, the topic conference crucial importance economic financial prospect western balkan countries. these country fully integrate eu economy eu financial system. the european union represent main trade partner bank originate eu dominate financial system region. a amply demonstrate experience, prior recent crisis, development eu affect immediately real financial system region. the eu western balkan consider partner and, such, legitimate interest policy action other. i trust conference try explore best mechanism mutual consultation coordination. cesee country choose integration eu main vehicle deliver sustainable long-term economic prosperity citizens. i would like point country consciously choose path eu integration: undertake painful structural reforms; make legal regulatory reform around process; open market goods, service capital eu. i think fair u expect long-term commitment solidarity partners. this integration convergence process certainly deliver past two decades. gdp growth outpace eu financial intermediation rapidly improved. common economic wisdom base indicator gdp per capita, relative financial intermediation, relative cost labour technology indicate process continue future. cesee country still offer attractive investment opportunities: have, general, good demographic dynamic geographically close europe emerge markets. this political economic integration naturally lead financial integration. however, i would like make three remark regard economic financial integration path pursuing. • first, main focus national authority see facilitate allocation capital productive sectors, provide right incentives, structural reforms, legal environment, tax policies, economic stability. this require common understand bank operate region. bank remain profit-maximizing entities. nevertheless, attentive long-term trends, stake sustainable development economy. • second, develop financial system pursue financial integration strategy base banks, account 90% financial system throughout region. therefore, recent suggestion develop domestic capital market alternative bank-based financial system useful, perhaps unfeasible short medium term. • third, see remain capital-hungry region, partly intermediate international banks. this fact recognize 2 bi central bankers’ speech eu regulator eu parent banks. a new business model rely purely domestically-generated deposit wrong answer previous extreme huge capital inflows. currently, key challenge financial stability see area comprise non-performing loans, slow growth credit economy, problem fiscal finances, exchange rate stability. their nature magnitude directly relate growth problem private sector approach consumption, save expectations. these problem either create expose crisis exacerbate due financial stability-related issue partner country approach solution challenges. more directly, bank sector see deleveraging due require financial stability measure european bank authorities. doe impact credit growth? the obvious answer yes. whether directly indirectly despite origin, current financial stability problem relate slow economic growth, which, turn, result shrink financial intermediation. in principal, development combine vicious circle, lead economy slow downward spiral. there certain important lesson learn crisis. above all, substantial change perception policy design policy implementation authority two define trends. first, observe new paradigm – rethink central bank policy design policy implementation. the new model consist first idea cpi-based inflation target might enough preserve macroeconomic financial stability, second, use macroprudential regulation combination traditional monetary policy measures. to effective, measure require strong coordination traditional monetary policy bank regulation supervision measures. unless coordinated, harm good. moreover, give strong cross-border financial link eu see, reach effect across borders. in respect, coordination become multi dimensional effort. due strong financial economic linkage cesee euro area, european policy regulations, macroeconomic macro prudential intervention authentic real-time impact economy give way new challenges. the coordination macroeconomic macroprudential measure within euro area continue exert macro stability pressure cesee. therefore, important economy cesee know, advance, understand eu’s legal, institutional regulatory development financial system possibly opinion potential impact unintended consequence development may economies. i would invite eu monetary supervisory authority focus overall picture think long-term solution rather short-term adjustments, which, instead solve problems, recycle old one (problems) new challenges, transform nature subject without really address overall stability issue. the eu bank union, view, important step towards integration coordination home host authorities. we appreciate fact establishment centralize supervisory authority facilitate information exchange supervisors, create efficient communication home host regulator reduce complexity deal multiple national supervisor regulatory bodies. the bank albania, member vienna initiative steer committee, advocate need eu authority comprehensively ass interconnectedness issue eu/euro area non-eu/non-euro economy order design balance sustainable policies. in particular, macro prudential measure euro area also consider situation potential impact non-eu host countries. we expect ecb, lead authority within ssm, play important constructive role, whereas non-eu supervisor must grant opportunity express view eu financial policy decision affect domestic financial stability, actual decision taken. the effective function bi central bankers’ speech 3 supervisory college also consider important issue, country systemic eu subsidiary may address supervisory concerns. on hand, would help small country region outside bank union unify view approach towards eu authority express concern single voice. in regard, bank albania, assume coordinate role, invite non-eu country contribute formulate common regional approach towards bank union effect countries. we also argue benefit ecb, monetary supervisory authority eu authority bring cesee country board discussions, like responsible doctor, who, provide strong remedy patient, try minimize potential side effects. the ecb must consider potential side effect policy region. this consideration concern five important issues: first, ecb large theoretic empiric expertise financial stability, monetary economic analysis; however, cesee country may precise direct view potential side effect economies; second, discussion among ecb cesee must start early, possibly design process rather implementation legislation regulation. this allow enough time cesee authority implement legal regulative amendment complement eu regulation adapt institutional structure timely manner. the reform eu deposit insurance bank resolution mechanisms, example, legislative regulative implication economy cesee due dominance european bank group financial sectors. however, ecb eu decide solution legislation eventually approved, would know potential implication (like regulatory arbitrage opportunities), require legal changes, financial cost bank system economies. information clearly interest cesee country would remove uncertainty risk among host supervisor (non-eu non-euro area) regard effective resolution (including burden-sharing) multinational european banks; third, establish “resolution colleges”, similar “colleges supervisors”, might intelligent efficient way prepare extreme situations. these college would allow home host supervisor discus ex-ante regard possible resolution multinational european banks, purpose bridge difference process burden share much possible. in principle, form supervision could design allow ecb share responsibility supervise multinational european bank host supervisor (particularly case systemic importance host countries). fourth, establish swap line liquidity euro, ecb host countries’ central bank (or supervisory authorities) – non-eu countries, manage overcome unexpected liquidity risk potential constrain face multinational european banks, might rise directly unintended consequence response decision take supervision financial stability authority euro area. this could case (non-euro area, non-eu) host countries, european bank systemic importance. in return, host countries’ supervisor provide ecb information financial situation systemic subsidiary respective supervisory policies; fifth, role international financial organizations. the imf, world bank, basel committee continue play important role shape financial system build resilience economies. the efsap excellent example illustrate point, vast expertise deal relate issue develop emerge countries. therefore, i believe involvement institution discussion process would benefit eu cesee economies. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the euro area cesee economy ultimately part political economic monetary union. despite current hardships, eu political economic integration agenda remain commit goal. one might even say despite potential political, social setback cause crisis, (the crisis) push integration agenda fast strong before. in respect, necessary connect political economic integration process together continue develop process speed. under current circumstances, regional cooperation communication become necessary objective cesee integration process, least bank financial market reform. it would much easy eu authority adopt address concern cesee single group rather individually. in conclusion, important establish significant level communication coordination among central bank eu institutions, legal regulative framework. finally, i would recommend complement similar level coordination among institutions, play significant role macroeconomic financial stability economies. in particular, need communication coordination among minister finance region fiscal policy essential macrofinancial stability economy play significant role successful implementation macroprudential tools. the coordination easy task, especially benefit come cost one’s partners, but, aspire far-reaching results, right manner appropriate moment react. thank you! bi central bankers’

open remark session “rethinking limitation monetary policy” speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, farewell conference honour professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel, jerusalem 18 june 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, the topic session – “the limitation monetary policy” – one attract great deal attention since begin financial crisis. circumstance force major central bank resort instrument policy carefully tailor unusual situation. alex cukierman michael woodford, present view issue minutes, among prominent academic write extensively1. before hand floor them, let say word current situation euro area, perspective european central bank (ecb) today’s topic longer-term issue euro area. in term current situation, euro area economy still phase adjustment. real gdp fell 0.6% fourth quarter 2012 0.2% first quarter 2013. output thus decline six consecutive quarters, labour market condition remain weak public private sector balance sheet adjustment continue weigh economic activity. unacceptably high level unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, prime concern economic policy-makers. recent survey data suggest improvement, low levels. export growth benefit recovery global demand. domestic demand support accommodative monetary policy; recent real income gain low oil price low inflation; confidence wealth effect stem improvement financial market since last summer. the ecb’s govern council stress monetary policy remain accommodative long necessary. in period ahead, monitor closely incoming information economic monetary development stand ready act necessary. in meantime, important note economic financial fragmentation euro area decline significantly since last summer. this beneficial effect real economy euro area countries. bank stress country able regain access interbank capital market – raise fund well capital. large corporation benefit low borrow cost capital markets. and small medium-sized enterprise see borrow cost bank somewhat reduced. all support investment. target balances, provide powerful summary indicator fragmentation, decline almost 300 billion euro 25% peak. the cost protection 1 see, example, cukierman, a., 2013, monetary policy institution before, during, global financial crisis, journal financial stability, press, cúrdia, v. woodford, m., 2011, the central-bank balance sheet instrument monetary policy, journal monetary economics, 58(1), 54–79. 2 bi central bankers’ speech risk deflation fall peak twice long-term average last summer slightly average now2. overall, monetary policy regain steer capacity, become lose large part euro area mid-2012. this important positive development. let turn limitation monetary policy. here i see two possible dimensions. the first positive refer effectiveness central bank action margin – example, interest rate close zero. the second normative refer constraint impose u mandate fear boundary central bank policy policy might become blurred. i dwell first dimension i think materially challenge ability deliver objective price stability low level interest rates. look back, despite extraordinarily test economic circumstances, inflation euro area remain whole consistent ecb’s objective close 2%. look forward, eurosystem staff project annual hicp inflation 1.4% 2013 1.3% 2014, medium-term inflation expectation remain anchor line definition price stability. one reason inflation expectation remain broadly stable – major central bank around world – prevent materialisation deflation risk adopt standard non-standard measure necessary. in euro area, one non-standard measure introduction outright monetary transaction (omt) programme last year, stabilise effect widely recognised. there numerous measure – standard interest rate policy non-standard measure – deploy deploy circumstance warrant. at time, i also make clear measure may unintended consequences. this mean used, mean need aware consequence manage appropriately. we look open mind measure especially effective institutional setup fall within mandate. this lead second dimension discussion limitation monetary policy, namely risk blur boundary central bank policy. to approach question, useful refer framework put forward another prominent scholar central bank matters. marvin goodfriend classify central bank action three categories3. the first category call “monetary policy” proper – change size monetary base via purchase sale government securities. second come “credit policy” – change composition central bank’s asset government security claim private sector various kinds. 2 see p. praet, monetary policy context balance sheet adjustments, speech peterson institute international economics, 22 may 2013. 3 see goodfriend, m., 2011, central bank credit turmoil: assessment federal reserve practice, journal monetary economics, 58(1), 1–12. bi central bankers’ speech 3 third “interest reserve policy” – change opportunity cost bank hold reserve excess reserves. goodfriend argue three category fiscal implications. and state credit policy interest reserve policy involve use public fund way may imply allocative role – may therefore blur respective role monetary fiscal authorities. in context, worth recall monetary constitution ecb firmly ground principle ‘ordoliberalism’, particularly two central tenets: • first, clear separation power objective authorities; • and second, adherence principle open market economy free competition, favour efficient allocation resources. more explicitly, reference another famous framework – three basic policy function richard musgrave describe allocation, stabilisation, distribution, aim deliver tommaso padoa-schioppa late describe efficiency, stability equity – policy concern macroeconomic stabilisation pursuit price stability. we play active role function allocation distribution4. at time, operational framework always include element goodfriend qualify credit policy. the ecb manage liquidity steer money market rate lend bank temporary credit operation broad range collateral. furthermore, always remunerate reserves. doe fact operation entail credit risk balance sheet central bank imply violation ordoliberal principles? doe imply ecb policy interfere credit allocation? my answer no. the risk take onto balance sheet context operation controlled, accept insofar strictly necessary pursuit price stability. this entirely consistent concept monetary dominance, stipulate fiscal consideration cannot stand way achievement price stability. indeed, ecb credit back adequate collateral, imply amount residual risk bear central bank buffered. there two layer protection. the first found ecb’s recourse borrow institution full credit guarantee represent balance sheets. the second – first exhaust – give appropriation collateral post back loan. if counterparty defaults, underlie collateral asset allow recovery amount lent. the use risk control measure valuation haircut variable margin mitigate exposure credit risk. the risk control principle apply context omt programme, limitation maturity eligible security (one three years) strict conditionality country eligible programme. another aspect operation design precisely goal achieve neutrality credit allocation. 4 have say that, objective monetary policy stabilisation imply cannot contribute efficiency equity, indeed stable price precondition (see b. coeuré, monetary policy fragment world”, speech oesterreichische nationalbank, vienna, 10 june 2013. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the ecb’s policy framework design view allow participation broad range counterparties. the framework rest fundamental principle equal treatment counterparties. equal treatment also reflect collateral framework, feature broad range asset set eligibility criterion apply eurosystem credit operation without distinction. a observation lend bank consistent untargeted monetary policy. in euro area, majority credit intermediation process via bank system, oppose financial markets. bank lend household financial non-financial firm size across credit spectrum. influence bank fund condition amount influence credit condition across whole economy. what i say apply normal times, also largely apply specific circumstance fragmentation financial system – circumstance face continue face, albeit diminish extent. financial fragmentation create distortion allocation resources. it undermine concept free market economy alter condition competition. in context, measure implement crisis allocative distributive role. on contrary, supplement financial intermediation become dysfunctional, contribute re-establishing allocative distributive neutrality markets. the liquidity measure take early crisis interpret light. at time, central bank substitute sudden disappearance interbank market activity act money market intermediary necessary. for ecb, task facilitate wide range counterparties accept refinance operation broad collateral framework. other central bank innovate use various target facility outside normal operate framework order reach broad economy. the ecb could also mobilise collateral framework relieve liquidity constraint face banks. we expand list eligible collateral, bank could liquefy balance sheet mobilise asset become difficult trade. in addition, ecb could contribute alleviate banks’ fund uncertainty provide bank assurance could rely refinance operation extend periods. the maximum maturity operation increase three month three years. through measures, ecb decisively address liquidity pressure face euro area bank avoid genuine credit crunch. professor fischer, lady gentlemen, what must clear i say far constitute limitation actions, consistent letter mandate philosophy market economy underpin it. we able regain good control monetary condition euro area economy, important provide appropriate monetary policy impulse economy. bi central bankers’ speech 5 part achievement due announcement omt programme. but equally important progress economic reform adjustment country level euro area level. such reform need continue. there still rich reform agenda, especially structural, country level many member euro area. there also important reform agenda european level. one key aspect bank union, rest single supervision single resolution, latter effective backstop necessary. preparation single supervision ecb advancing, naturally work closely relevant national authorities. five work stream underway: first, map euro area bank system identify systemically important banks; second, supervisory model adopted, likely centre around joint supervisory teams; third, supervisory data reporting; fourth legal issues; fifth, asset quality review undertake prior take bank supervision. formal adoption legal text european parliament allow u formalise preparation launch operational one year adoption. effective supervision require effective resolution, turn require establishment single resolution mechanism. we count european commission make proposal due course. once process launched, bank union within operational reach. it provide answer many challenge currently face euro area, include uneven credit condition fragmentation financial markets. when observer outside look economic monetary union, often emphasise unfinished appear compare fully establish union unite states. in doing, highlight number unresolved issues, example monetary union 17 otherwise sovereign states, credit transfer across member state view differently credit transfer within individual member state. the equivalent target balances, example, non-issue unite states. however, observer vastly underestimate political capital invest euro leaders, well political significance investment future europe. of course, much work remain do economic policy-makers across europe. but i confident together build strong economic monetary union ultimately deliver jobs, growth return prosperity citizen euro area. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: the role central bank open statement dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, panel discussion aicgs (american institute contemporary german studies) panel, berlin, 12 june 2013. * * * lady gentleman the event past five year call question many assumption foundation monetary financial system. but necessary draw right conclusion current crisis, discard lesson learn previous crisis – remain equally valid. the cautious role central bank spur economic growth lesson – lesson learn hard way 70 80s. some central bank try foster economic growth reduce interest rate considerably – even price significantly high inflation rates. in contrast, inflation rate country independent central bank focus deliver price stability comparatively low years. while average inflation germany stand 3.4%, reach 8.2% france, 12.5 % italy 12.4% spain. the important point low inflation come expense low growth. it turn quite opposite true – best contribution sustainable growth central bank make keep price stable. but stable price prerequisite growth. a stable financial system also crucial – lesson financial crisis. it utmost importance restore preserve confidence resilience financial system whole. in process, central bank play important role, especially come mitigate systemic risks, nowadays know macro-prudential regulation supervision. in keep price stable contribute stable financial system, central bank put place condition sustainable growth. but cannot deliver growth own. all measure eurosystem take contain fallout crisis, like ecb govern council reduce interest rate mere 50 basis points, decide provide bank quasi unlimited liquidity, intervene bond market help stabilise output short term. the fundamental problem euro area structural nature. a such, require structural solution. precarious public finance lack competitiveness root current crisis. in part euro area, problem compound restrictive credit supply banks. these challenge cannot overcome monetary policy. all central bank buy time – time government parliament consolidate budgets, improve function product labour market recapitalize banks. in safeguard monetary financial stability, central bank pave way growth. but actually get there, government parliament must go route implement require reforms. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: responsible leadership time crisis address mr mario draghi, president european central bank, occasion receive esmt (european school management technology) leadership award 2013, berlin, 13 june 2013. * * * good afternoon. it great honour receive award responsible leadership i would like thank mario monti kind introductory words. i regret i able join person today berlin please i address via video. the fact single currency european central bank testament role leadership. many young remember, u recall europe 20 year ago know unimaginable speak single currency. today, integral part lives. but

euro area – secure value common currency. we take responsibility utmost seriousness directly affect life 330 million citizen euro area. since launch euro 1999, fulfil mandate even difficult times. we continue fulfil task. i proud personally contribute historic project euro represent tangible sign european integration. but pride accompany deep feel responsibility. there doubt recent period economic financial turbulence test u new ways. we take new measure fulfil responsibility price stability. we look data, ass evidence, decide measure necessary ensure stability euro. one decision combat market

construct consumer credit panel allow u good understand financial condition homeowner students, conduct bi-annual poll small business understand credit need availability. the result latter help inform series clinic conduct help small business take next step access capital identify new source funding. a i mention earlier, always eager engage students, commitment region include series educational program worth highlighting. first, math x economics, encourage student attend title 1 school consider prepare career finance economics. and, second, yearly feed challenge competitions, team student high school college district take role member federal open market committee (fomc) debate appropriate next step u.s. monetary policy. all all, lot keep colleague fully engage community represent. next, i’ll review recent development national regional economy, end talk happy answer question economic outlook. a always, i say reflect view necessarily federal reserve system federal open market committee. national economic condition let begin take stock moment. then i address expectation performance economy remainder 2013 2014. accord national bureau economic research, determine time economic recession expansions, current expansion begin mid-2009, four year ago. however, expansion subdue far, average annual growth rate real gdp 2.2 percent past four years. while growth 2 bi central bankers’ speech rate near fomc participants’ estimate u.s. economy’s longer-run growth rate well many outside analysts, rapid pace growth likely necessary reduce meaningfully significant economic slack develop great recession. consistent modest pace economic growth, improvement labor market condition slow. even though unemployment rate decline 2.7 percentage point peak 10 percent october 2009, still many people want job count unemployed actively look work. an alternative measure labor market conditions, employment population ratio, influence change number workers, show limit improvement. job loss rate fallen, hire rate remain depress low levels. take together, labor market still cannot regard healthy. numerous indicators, include behavior labor compensation, consistent view remain great deal slack labor markets. nevertheless, i state early speeches, i see persuasive evidence improve underlie fundamental much private sector u.s. economy. key measure household leverage decline near low level well decade. household net worth, express percent disposable income, increase back average previous decade, reflect rise equity home price decline debt. bank ease credit standard somewhat recently prolong period tightness. a result, experience fairly typical cyclical recovery consumer spend durable goods. for example, light-weight motor vehicle sell seasonally-adjusted annual rate nearly 16.1 million august, close number sell 2007. similarly, five year house production well consistent underlie demographic trends, appear work excess supply house build boom year last decade. exist home sale remain upward trend, widely follow national home price index around 12 percent 12 month end july.1 indeed, anecdotal report suggest higher-than-expected increase home price due lack home sale. however, number risk outlook evident. long-term interest rates, include mortgage rates, rise significantly since early may. since then, see sharp drop refinance mortgage applications, moderate significant decline purchase mortgage application fairly flat house start new home sales. although i anticipate rise long-term rate lead downturn housing, development suggest high mortgage rate cut upward momentum house sector. we need monitor upcoming data closely ass fully impact high rate house recovery. another risk federal fiscal policy could exert restraint economy rest year 2014. it difficult ass much contractionary effect sequestration, example, already occurred, still remain ahead. a relate issue high degree uncertainty fiscal policy. in come weeks, congress consider fund government next fiscal year also debate debt limit. this create uncertainty fiscal outlook may exert restrain influence household business spending. one risk highlight global economic outlook. even though euro area appear begin grow protract recession, growth area still expect fairly weak best. in addition, growth many large emerge economy slowed, country large trade current account 1 base corelogic home price index include distress sales. bi central bankers’ speech 3 imbalance see financial market currency come pressure. if growth abroad slow, could impede growth u.s. export could result le strength manufacture production employment u.s. thus, return analogy i use previous speeches, i see economy tug-of-war headwind underlie fundamental improvement, great deal uncertainty improvement underlie fundamental prevail. in end, best guess growth 2013, measure q4/q4 basis, near post-recession average. but i believe good case make pace growth pick 2014. the private sector economy continue heal, amount fiscal drag subside. i also expect that, despite near-term concerns, growth prospect among major trade partner improve next year. and combination event likely create environment business investment spend strengthen. however, notion economy grow swiftly remain forecast rather reality point. turn inflation outlook, total inflation, measure personal consumption expenditure (pce) deflator, fluctuate recently short-term movement energy prices, continue run fomc’s express goal 2 percent. core inflation, is, exclude food energy, slow late 2012 early 2013 well 2 percent, although show sign stabilize last couple months. a decomposition core inflation reveal recent slow inflation largely confine core goods, whereas rate increase core service relatively steady. such case 2010 – previous instance significant slow inflation. in addition, inflation expectation far remain relatively stable level somewhat current inflation rate. this help prevent undesirable drop inflation relative 2 percent objective. thus, i anticipate inflation firm month ahead move toward fomc’s longer-run objective. still, fomc recognize inflation persistently 2 percent could pose risk economic performance. a always case, substantial uncertainty surround forecast. moreover, always possibility unforeseen shock. thus, monitor u.s. global economic condition carefully adjust view likely path growth, inflation unemployment rate accordingly response new information. so portend monetary policy? a aware, last week’s meet federal open market committee make change monetary policy. in particular, committee decide continue purchase long-term treasury security agency mortgage-backed security monthly pace $45 billion $40 billion, respectively. the fomc statement reaffirm committee’s intention “continue purchase treasury agency mortgage-backed securities, employ policy tool appropriate, outlook labor market improve substantially context price stability.”2 we also reaffirm forward guidance respect federal fund rate. the statement note committee “decided keep target range federal fund rate 0 ¼ percent currently anticipate exceptionally low range federal fund rate appropriate least long unemployment rate remain 6–1/2 percent, inflation one two year ahead project half percentage point committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, longer-term inflation expectation continue well anchored.”3 2 federal open market committee statement, september 18, 2013. 3 federal open market committee statement, september 18, 2013. 4 bi central bankers’ speech one noteworthy question emerge follow meet committee begin reduce pace asset purchases. although i can’t speak committee, i provide reason decision. to begin taper, i two test must passed: (1) evidence labor market show improvement, (2) information economy’s forward momentum make confident labor market improvement continue future. so far, i think make progress respect metrics, yet achieve success. with respect first metric, see labor market improvement since program begin last september. over time period, unemployment rate decline 7.3 percent 8.1 percent. however, time, decline unemployment rate overstate degree improvement. other metric labor market conditions, hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate, quit rate vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate much modest improvement labor market condition compare suggest decline unemployment rate. in particular, still hard unemployed find jobs. currently, three unemployed worker per job opening, oppose average two period 2003 2007. with respect second metric – confidence economic recovery strong enough generate sustain labor market improvement – i don’t think yet pass test. the economy pick forward momentum 2 percent growth rate – even sustain – might sufficient generate improvement labor market conditions. moreover, i note earlier, fiscal uncertainty loom large right congress consider issue fund government raise debt limit ceiling. assume change assessment efficacy cost associate purchase program, i’d like see economic news make confident see continue improvement labor market. then i would feel comfortable time come cut pace asset purchases.4 regional economic condition let turn economic condition region. the upstate new york economy continue grow, pace somewhat slow national economy. in part, reflect fact u.s. economy recover much deep severe recession upstate new york. a national economy continue heal, place like upstate new york, didn’t see huge boom bust house economy great recession, don’t much grind make up. but region’s slow economic growth recovery also reflect re-emergence historical trend – upstate new york hasn’t tend perform well rest country economic expansions. like many economy northeast, upstate tend grow slowly recent decades, population shift part country dominant manufacture industry shrink considerably. these trend play syracuse area. like upstate new york generally, recession syracuse deep nation’s. however, syracuse area experience deep recession upstate whole, lose 13,000 job downturn. the area’s recovery lag behind upstate. so far, syracuse gain back le half job lost. recent job growth lead region’s education health sectors. together, sector add stability local economy provide foundation growth. over past several years, recession recovery, sector add 1,000 job year local economy. the leisure hospitality sector, 4 for think monetary policy outlook, i refer speech make early week: reflection economic outlook implication monetary policy. bi central bankers’ speech 5 well retail sector, also solid source job growth area. however, probably well know, job loss region’s manufacture industry weigh gains. about 9,000 manufacture job lose since start great recession. and, slow job recovery begin nation’s manufacture sector 2010, syracuse continue lose job recent year – painful process area continue endure sure. nonetheless, trend result diversify economy. in fact, share worker employ metro area’s manufacture sector 8 percent, nation’s 9 percent share. the private education health sector emerge large industries, employ one five workers. so, face local economy change dramatically somewhat painful restructure process. but i believe process reach conclusion, result diversify local economy provide strong foundation syracuse build go forward. hence interest collaborative effort business, academic health sector economic growth. these effort capitalize strength region may well good way economic development syracuse buffalo rochester well. each metro area strong university, strong health sector business community eager find way leverage local asset boost economic development. look forward, i believe college university syracuse help drive region’s economy year come. syracuse build asset continue make partnership industry high education high priority. when company university work together, become powerful engine innovation economic growth. these collaboration key ingredient help improve competitiveness local businesses, university themselves, regions, take every opportunity exploit partnership much possible unleash full potential. college graduate find job let finish say word value education. there doubt great recession sluggish recovery follow make difficult many people find jobs. i’m sure many today worry find good job graduate, may wonder whether go college turn good investment. let reassure you, despite weak labor market condition prevail since great recession, benefit college degree remain significant. research undertake new york feed clearly show young people college degree likely job tend earn high wage without degree – true even may underemployed initially first enter labor market graduation. in fact, research find extent, always prove challenge college graduate transition labor market, even economic expansions, time passes, graduate’s experience grows, transition generally get accomplish successfully. although true labor market difficult college graduate recent years, i confident find work transition higher-skilled job gain experience labor market improves. thank kind attention i happy take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: the usefulness forward guidance speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, money marketeers club new york, new york, 26 september 2013. * * * the slide refer speech available ecb website. i wish thank federic holm-hadulla arthur saint-guilhem contribution remarks. i remain solely responsible opinion contain herein. lady gentlemen, it’s great pleasure speak tonight. i use opportunity elaborate late tool central bank adopt deal macroeconomic consequence global financial crisis. this tool forward guidance. what forward guidance mean monetary policy context? well, allow brief definition, forward guidance describe explicit statement central bank likely path future policy rates. these statement typically condition – le explicitly – evolution certain key macroeconomic aggregates. up 1970s central bank communication base secrecy market surprise1. but central bank move away surprise market and, instead, move open transparent monetary policy making. guidance future course monetary policy even common practice central bank crisis. for example, since 1997, reserve bank new zealand include communication practice release numerical projection future path policy rate. however, forward guidance introduce crisis unprecedented step many central banks; term scope well clarity. i argue recent initiative central bank communication useful addition central bank toolkit. at time unprecedented challenges, ensure central bank act steady hand also speak steady voice. to set stage, i first give take design consideration surround forward guidance, include rationale; pro con different type forward guidance; way measure effectiveness forward guidance. then, i zoom euro area discus ecb’s forward guidance along dimensions. forward guidance: design consideration so what’s purpose forward guidance? forward guidance aim ensure market expectation future monetary policy indeed consistent policy intention respective central bank. of course, central bank’s communication always provide reliable signal market make way yield curve affect finance condition economy. otherwise, monetary policy may, itself, become source volatility, thus complicate economic decision private actor – exact opposite achieve. 1 see brunner (1981) goodfriend (1986). for empirical evaluation see cook hahn (1989). 2 bi central bankers’ speech but premium clear communication particularly large extraordinary situations, example policy rate at, close to, effective low bound, normal channel monetary policy transmission impaired, exceptional uncertainty state economy. such situation occur seldom. this make difficult private agent infer future monetary policy path past regularities. hence, clear add value situation make central bank communication explicit. this explain many central bank previously use forward guidance adopt tool recent times. how forward guidance work? well, first all, central bank link forward guidance main policy interest rates. in implement monetary policy, central bank calibrate main policy tool establish certain level short term interest rate market. at time, expect future short term interest rate key ingredient determination long term interest rates. long term interest rate turn essential saving, consumption investment decisions, ultimately development price inflation economy. indeed, recent paper central bank communication provide clear evidence central banks’ communication policy decision assessment macroeconomic environment important effect long term interest rates.2 through forward guidance – provide systematic guidance expect path future policy rate – central bank exert strong influence market expectation future short term interest rates. in fact, central bank direct leverage broad finance condition along broad maturity spectrum. some central bank also attempt influence term structure long maturity directly, example give regular indication market future pace, composition time asset purchase programmes. in case, forward guidance mean establish consistency current policy measure long-term policy orientation. but work, content forward guidance reflect central bank’s mandate. only central bank’s announcement perceive credible. let explain detail. from conceptual perspective two type forward guidance distinguish depend objective pursued3. first, forward guidance aim merely provide great transparency policy intentions. this entail two elements. the first element provide great clarity central bank’s assessment economic outlook relevant assessment medium term risk price stability policy goal may pursue. the second element provide clarity central bank react outlook. in certain cases, market’s assessment economic outlook may clearly deviate central bank’s assessment. moreover, even share assessment outlook, market may expect systematically different policy response pursue central bank. in cases, forward guidance help central bank clarify assessment future economic condition reaction function. 2 see brand et al. (2010), gürkaynak et al. (2005), kuttner posen (1999), bibinger et al. (2013). 3 see praet (2013) detail exposition distinction. see also campbell et al. (2012) taxonomy “odyssean” vs. “delphic” forward guidance underlie distinction. bi central bankers’ speech 3 this especially valuable time upward volatility financial market risk create risk premia along yield curve, thereby induce premature withdrawal monetary accommodation. second, forward guidance serve communicate market participant central bank’s policy intention changed. most notably, central bank may try convince market would keep interest rate low, even would imply inflation well previous objective, least temporarily. the promise high future inflation, credible, induce private agent substitute future current consumption, hence provide additional stimulus today. this type forward guidance close academic concept forward guidance strict sense – discussed, example, woodford (2012). the main challenge guidance inherent inconsistency time thus lack credibility. when time comes, central bank may tempt deviate prior commitment: benefit high inflation expectation term front-loaded spend reaped, central bank may will pay bill term high inflation afterwards. if public foresee temptation, expectation might remain unaffected first instance desire inter-temporal substitution spend might materialise. this possible explanation why, practice, central bank refrain use forward guidance way imply major change strategy. therefore, central banks’ forward guidance rather aim provide great clarity reaction function assessment future economic conditions. but forward guidance also face challenge merely serf clarify economic outlook reaction function. in particular, adoption forward guidance may interpret sign central bank indirectly disclose negative information risk economic outlook. in case private agent may infer forward guidance statement recovery may slow deflationary pressure strong widely anticipated. a consequence, forward guidance could contractionary, rather expansionary, effect economic sentiment. hence, order effective, announcement must emphasise path future policy rates, albeit conditional underlie state economy. the ecb’s forward guidance these consideration integral design ecb’s forward guidance. let explain why. in july meeting, govern council announce expect key ecb interest rate remain present low level extend period time. this expectation base overall subdue outlook inflation extend medium term, give broad-based weakness real economy subdue monetary dynamics. the decision adopt forward guidance motivate sustain upward steepen trend display structure money market interest rate precede month (see slide 2). this trend lead situation part accommodation introduce early policy action withdrawn. moreover, increase volatility money market rate make expectation effective stance vulnerable shock disconnect underlie economic conditions. thus, precise communication monetary policy orientation necessary protect still nascent economic recovery heal euro area capital market overly tight volatile monetary conditions. 4 bi central bankers’ speech against background, ecb’s forward guidance follow two concrete objectives: first, curb interest rate volatility policy-relevant horizon; second, anchor rate expectation firmly around path ensure degree monetary accommodation warrant outlook price stability. the ecb’s objective suppress money market volatility. in crisis, abundant central bank liquidity compress price many financial market segments. the ability market price two-way risk factor resilience along normalisation path. our objective therefore steer money market rate towards predefined value ensure fluctuation remain within reasonable bind hurt economic recovery. when interpret govern council’s forward guidance, three element particularly relevant. first, provide exhaust scope reduction key ecb interest rates. in fact, forward guidance formulation, decide unanimously govern council, explicitly incorporate ease bias, thereby account possibility cut policy rates. second, importantly, forward guidance firmly anchor ecb’s mandate monetary policy strategy. in particular, path policy rate remain conditional outlook inflation review time within analytical framework provide ecb’s monetary policy strategy. this analytical framework ass economic monetary development relevant inflation. in particular, conditionality forward guidance reflect two-pillar strategy. that is: medium-term outlook inflation evaluate term economic analysis indicator confirm broad-based weakness real economy; evaluate basis monetary analysis indicator confirm subdue monetary dynamics. third, forward guidance help u focus mandate, de-emphasise policy relevance single data release concentrate medium term. in words, forward guidance communicate one – one – expectation key interest rate evolve. it – – communication relevant ass policy orientation. unless communication changes, policy orientation remain unchanged. ha forward guidance achieve objectives? it probably early answer. but allow preliminary assessment. look money market conditions, number indicator give u comfort that, absence forward guidance, money market rate would display upward volatility observed. first, influence shock come outside euro area dampen (see slide 3). before 3rd july forward guidance announced, econometric evidence high frequency money market data could exclude 1y1y ois swap rate u euro area exhibit stable relationship. this relationship break 3rd july, recover while, although low coefficient introduction forward guidance. second, uncertainty future monetary policy declined, represent positive outcome forward guidance (see slide 4). le uncertainty policy orientation consistent low term premia money market rates. and third, forward guidance somewhat reduce sensitivity money market forward rate various horizon news data surprise – type mute impact monetary policy conditions. these include news unrelated euro area fundamentals, example communication central bank monetary policy decisions. and bi central bankers’ speech 5 include data release merely confirm assessment outlook, hence bring new information change assessment. however, one might reasonably ask whether impact forward guidance whole euro area constrain financial fragmentation. to i would respond important emphasise ecb’s forward guidance link explicitly main policy rate(s) euro area. and however fragment interbank market are, guide expectation future path main refinance rate relevant refinance condition bank across euro area. overall, preliminary evidence suggest forward guidance help anchor money market condition euro area firmly level consider appropriate monetary policy stance, give present assessment outlook price stability. this confirm time. and time forward guidance prove usefulness protect nascent economic recovery. conclusion let conclude. face sluggish economic activity limit room manoeuvre, several central bank adopt explicit communication future policy orientation form forward guidance. this serve reassure market participant general public central bank preserve monetary accommodation backdrop persistently low growth, employment inflation. in design forward guidance, central bank guide particular feature respective economy specificity mandates. the common feature among different form forward guidance emerge recent month aim reinforce rather change expectation overall policy orientation respective central bank. it essential condition credible. reference brand c., d. buncic j. turunen (2010), ‘the impact ecb monetary policy decision communication yield curve’, journal european economic association, vol. 8 (6), page 1266–1298. bibinger, m., linzert, t. l. winkelmann (2013), ‘ecb monetary policy surprises: identification cojumps interest rates’, sfb 649 discussion paper 2013–038. brunner, k (1981), ‘the art central banking’, centre research government policy business, work paper no.81–6. campbell, j., evans, c., fisher, j. a. justiniano (2012), ‘macroeconomic effect federal reserve forward guidance’, brook paper economic activity, spring 2012, issue 1, page 1–80. cook, t. hahn, t.

outlook danish economy speech mr lars rohde, governor national bank denmark, annual meet association danish mortgage bank 2013, copenhagen, 26 september 2013. * * * the global economy recover moderate pace. in 2nd quarter, euro area saw positive growth first time 18 months, look ahead, economy expect pick further, albeit slowly. activity u economy also set grow, although bond yield begin rise. growth support extremely accommodative monetary policy, feed fund target rate close zero current large-scale asset purchases. activity danish economy remain potential level, here, too, sign situation begin improve. gdp grow 0.5 per cent 2nd quarter. private consumption flat, basically since 2010. in danmark nationalbank’s assessment, macroeconomic balance le adjust follow year overheat economy subsequent downturn, foundation renew growth place. signal abroad also encouraging. danmark nationalbank project growth 1½ per cent 2014 2015. that high average growth rate expect euro area, line outlook germany. over last year, household begin take optimistic view house market, people expect price rise. but recovery unevenly distribute across country. price flat copenhagen rise 10 per cent last year. with recent overheat danish house market mind, might begin ask whether thing move bite fast copenhagen. however, price increase see light precede strong fall 2008–09 decline 2011. an article danmark nationalbank’s recent monetary review compare price level flat northern european capitals. while average flat 100 square metre cost kr. 2.3 million copenhagen, would cost twice much stockholm oslo three time much paris. in berlin, hand, price kr. 1.9 million. although difference hardly use indicator national price developments, illustrative show price level copenhagen particularly high international perspective. judge economic fundamentals, price likely continue rise pace see last year, they. in danmark nationalbank’s assessment, price flat copenhagen far equilibrium – although equilibrium level difficult identify precisely. the equilibrium price expect increase 2–3 per cent annually, experience show may large deviation trend. a danmark nationalbank previously point out, structure house tax contribute instability house market. the outlook danish economy begin pick steam highlight issue much spare capacity actually have, economy begin experience capacity problems. danmark nationalbank compile output gap minus 2½ per cent gdp. that tremendously large, economy expect approach potential level come years. it estimate employment increase around 55,000 without create inflationary pressure economy. this snapshot. a couple year line, figure high structural unemployment fall structural labour force increase expected. most increase employment achieve via high participation rate, estimate room unemployment fall approximately 15,000. irrespective measure unemployment applied, unemployment low view last decades. in fact, already 2 bi central bankers’ speech see first sign labour become scarcer. for example, small increase number firm report shortage labour, also high influx foreign labour danish labour market last years. this indicate unemployment far structural level. the outlook danish economy indicate fiscal policy eased. the time could prove bad, i mean fiscal stimulation demand might accelerate upswing, risk economy rapidly experience capacity problems. the new fiscal policy framework leave scope easing. the budget deficit close 3 per cent gdp year 2014 2015 expect extraordinary revenue early taxation capital pension disregarded, be. when bill passed, precondition revenue taxation move forward use reduce government debt. this revenue extraordinary temporary, entail shortfall late time. the structural budget balance deteriorate 2014 close budget act’s limit minus 0.5 per cent gdp. the conclusion clear. there neither need scope fiscal easing. lend bank mortgage bank corporate sector virtually unchanged since 2008. but redistribution among credit institutions, lend mortgage bank increased, lend bank declined. this may reflect need bank consolidate financial crisis, encourage customer – especially firm – raise mortgage loan rather bank loans. at time, firm may find mortgage loan attractive. in addition, firm increasingly seek alternative source funding, corporate bonds, sector loan trade credits, export guarantees, etc. the mortgage bank able meet demand loan thereby contribute stable supply credit crisis years. this apply relation corporate customers, also relation households. the number family fall behind mortgage payment low since mid-1990s. even financial crisis lead small increase arrears ratio mortgage debt. the question whether also likely case future. danish household far debt relative income family countries. this cause concern among observer danish economy whether family able service debt, especially danish economy affect another serious recession . let state clearly: danmark nationalbank share view high debt ratio among household problem relation financial stability. even financially squeeze household typically service mortgage cut private consumption instead. this affect demand economy hence corporate sector. that impact macroeconomic stability rather financial stability, indirectly bank may also affected. danmark nationalbank’s recent monetary review evaluate number stress scenario interest rate unemployment soar house equity price dive. while select stress scenario would lead loan impairment charge financial sector overall, calculation point mortgage bank particularly severely affected. this mortgage loan nearly always last item debt family tight budget default on. for families, even considerable worsen finance would lead small increase probability fall behind mortgage payments. the danish economy stabilised. that also true financial sector. for first time since collapse roskilde bank early summer 2008, summer quiet – even sunny. but are, nevertheless, couple financial summer story tell. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the first one f1 loans, i.e. mortgage loan annual refinancing. the current debate trigger word warn s&p. but debate robustness construction behind f1 loan much older. particularly auction december 2008, people begin say, “suppose that...”. suppose bond sold. at time rule exception market froze. liquidity typically dry doubt arise credit risk. households’ long-term loan annual refinance base bond much short maturities. this give mortgage bank quality resemble ordinary banks, may “runs” them. that risk exist old mortgage credit model since loan “prefinanced”. so question is, would happen practice mortgage bank find situation – due uncertainty credit risk, perhaps – cannot sell short-term bond connection refinancing. the brief answer danmark nationalbank act lender last resort – bank – mortgage bank solvent pledge adequate collateral. in practice, latter would presumably bond sell market. mortgage bonds, also bond issue mortgage bank themselves, part danmark nationalbank’s collateral basis, i.e. may pledge danmark nationalbank collateral. this option limit impact scenario bond difficult sell. so response s&p others immediate threat financial stability denmark. but mean business model base danmark nationalbank backstop expedient private-sector financial institutions. that sustainable solution. one strength danish mortgage credit model is, inherently, robust subsidisation whatsoever required. that exactly balance principle aim at. to extent possible, mortgage bank take credit risk, type risk. investor confidence creditworthiness liquidity mortgage bond core danish mortgage credit system. i occasion argue that, order maintain confidence, mortgage bank take cautious approach go near statutory limits. the resilient mortgage bank losses, great probability meet obligation investors. and thing equal, take great shock trigger “run” mortgage banks. i would like take opportunity acknowledge initiative already take view address issue. auction spread year, business model product range adjusted, price structure change order give borrower incentive choose product low refinance risk. all initiative make positive contribution sustainability danish mortgage credit. but system still involve considerable refinance risk. in 2014, bond link adjustable-rate loan total kr. 750 billion currently set fall due, auction towards end year le size – kr. 400 billion – auction december 2008. the danish mortgage credit system serve u well many year prove worth financial crisis. all – good reason – remain subject debate. i believe return old mortgage credit model. but important find long-term solutions. the second summer topic regulation financial sector wake financial crisis. both international national level, politician take action crisis. a wide range measure introduced: increase capital liquidity requirements, enhance governance requirement financial institutions, new 4 bi central bankers’ speech crisis management regime, mention few. in addition, danish financial supervisory authority give additional resource powers. the crisis reveal various weaknesses, addressed. but see previously, pressure ease rule emerge point. personally, i rather surprise see happen denmark. the bank rescue package enjoy broad political support recently clear aim: financial crisis – never again! the time come tidy tighten rules. however, wind change seem sweep across political landscape. ha danish financial supervisory authority give much power, requirement impose mortgage bank become tight? it financial crisis already forgotten. but i would surprise collective political memory short. if so, would short european countries. so i would like remind denmark provide massive support financial crisis, government take huge risk behalf tax-payers. under bank rescue package 1, government provide guarantee astronomical kr. 4,200 billion. with bank rescue package 2, government give financial sector capital injection kr. 46 billion order prevent potential credit crunch, guarantee debt issuance kr. 194 billion. on fifth anniversary introduction general government guarantee, government still inject capital total kr. 31 billion sector. so far, government direct cost cover sector’s payment support, risk enormous. in perspective doubt need tightening. yes, come long way term tidy up, would unfortunate pendulum already begin swing back. thank invite speak. bi central bankers’ speech 1 paul tucker: monetary strategy prospect speech mr paul tucker, deputy governor financial stability bank england, member monetary policy committee, member financial policy committee member prudential regulation authority board, association financial market europe flagship conference “financing growth”, london, 24 september 2013. * * * around western world monetary policy critical juncture. a difference relative pace recovery different economy become apparent, central bank articulate see particular condition faces. contrast early 2009, simply prim monetary pump prevent economy slip depression deflation. indeed, contrast 2011 2012 when, again, central bank act le unison contain, best could, spillover crisis euro area periphery. today, although normality hardly restored, back circumstance difference local economic condition matter domestic monetary prospect exchange rates. the big policy trade in uk, core challenge lie balance two medium-term risk – economy’s productive capacity price stability.1 concretely, long weakness activity, great erosion economy’s capital resource damage skill capability labour force. the monetary policy committee need provide monetary stimulus contain short-term economic weakness but, even important, reduce longer-run cost – social economic. but cannot expense price stability – or, technically, allow medium-term inflation expectation drift away target 2%. be anchor slip, ability support recovery would undermined. it sometimes suggest independent central banker averse inflation period low growth increase unemployment. i hope past year demonstrate that, fact, credibility bank england’s commitment price stability enable u provide exceptional monetary support help recovery. it unimaginable that, prior bank independence 1997, government would able hold policy rate effectively zero make monetary injection £375bn without inflationary expectation – government finance cost – spiral control. but credibility take granted. even cannot provide stimulus without limit, without wary eye inflation expectations. nor easy judge much stimulus need secure recovery give extraordinary uncertainty go real economy. on one hand, rise unemployment, inflict terrible cost directly affected, lot small anyone would expect give weakness output. on hand, mean productivity fall recent years, leave 15% current estimate pre-crisis trend path – sharp contrast us. let’s clear: understand productivity weak. and mean highly uncertain amount slack economy currently prospectively; uncertain extent consequent downward pressure domestically-generated inflation; and, thus, uncertain path output employment consistent non-inflationary growth. that sum background 1 this reflect page 13–15 monetary policy committee’s document forward guidance, available online http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pages/forwardguidance.aspx. 2 bi central bankers’ speech approach policy set past couple years. provide stimulus; pause see whether inflation expectation remain anchored; if, if, stimulus needed, provide etc. a “probing” approach. the mpc’s framework forward guidance and, i see it, broadly consistent committee’s new framework forward guidance. the government revise remit mpc, committee has, effect, formally clarify adopt probe approach policy order strike right balance risk stability risk sclerosis. to clear, i see forward guidance – personally would favour – commit committee knowingly keep policy loose beyond point would prudent. i say because, part academia commentariat, expression “low long” use rather special way mean that: policy loose beyond period that, ex post, would warrant special stimulus, order actively deliver persistent rise inflation inflation expectation target, thereby push prevail real rate interest accelerate recovery.2 while without insight mechanic monetary stimulus, stream economic model make absolutely critical assumption even monetary authority deliberately generate persistent rise inflation, anti-inflation credibility remain 100% intact; later, central bank simply announce thing back normal. that utterly unrealistic. to re-iterate: mpc’s forward guidance provide articulate framework probe approach policy, without change preference inflation.3 say committee’s approach policy way might particularly valuable period sign recovery become apparent. these condition would easy financial markets, business household jump mistake conclusion monetary stimulus soon begin withdrawn. give slack economy, committee rush. assume anchor inflation expectations, orthodox central bank would contemplate begin withdraw stimulus economy reach “escape velocity”, i define mean “the economy growing, set continue grow, pace gradually absorb slack labour market within firms”.4 and point central bank would ass erosion slack economy thus extent downward pressure inflation dissipating. since policy deliberation frame term “escape velocity”, i saw real merit mpc forward guidance cast term threshold real growth. manifestly, could measure slack economy; would clear not. once passed, would prompt rich assessment slack inflationary pressures, draw wide possible range indicators. the committee decide threshold specify term unemployment. the mpc’s threshold says: threshold assess inflationary pressures, although committee must maintain broad assessment month-by-month, quarter- 2 see woodford (2012), “methods policy accommodation interest-rate low bound,” present jackson hole symposium. 3 this consistent bean (2013), “global aspect unconventional monetary policy”, monetary policy committee’s forward guidance document (op cit); governor’s remark august inflation report press conference: “guidance change reaction function, give good sense mpc’s reaction function financial market participants”. 4 see remark treasury select committee hear discus inflation report 28 june 2011, 2012 2013 annual report monetary policy treasury select committee. bi central bankers’ speech 3 by-quarter. the threshold target. indeed, monetary authority cannot target unemployment; target price stability, paul volcker recently stressed.5 that committee’s forward guidance incorporates, crucially, “knockout” inflation expectations, individual member judge whether “sufficiently well anchored”. beyond that, i glad “financial stability knockout”, committee effect recognise monetary policy influence risk-taking behaviour financial system.6 this mean mpc suddenly lurch towards supplementary goal try control excess markets. the uk’s new architecture give financial policy committee tool threat stability financial system. but limit monetary policy backstop – boom bust increase likelihood inflation volatile future. overall, committee’s forward guidance forestall avoidable uncertainty “reaction function”, policy set. but affect great uncertainty evolution recovery. uncertainty economic outlook of course, financial market inevitably transform committee’s state-contingent guidance prediction committee begin withdraw monetary stimulus; market trade instrument different maturities, ie time-contingent feature state-contingent contractual triggers. but mpc provide state-contingent guidance reason. we cannot wave away uncertainty surround performance real economy. if understand productivity growth weak, could confident whether recover tandem recovery spending. if happen, fall unemployment could slow, monetary stimulus might need withdraw time. if, hand, productivity growth remain weak, job creation economy recover could strong, average past couple years. that wide band uncertainty around mpc’s august forecast unemployment. my probability distribution unemployment broadly “flat” sense i regard one scenario materially likely other. a data come in, bank’s projection unemployment far likely change, one direction other, committee’s forward guidance. probabilistically, could explain part rise money market curve give sign recovery. all underline need committee keep review, month month, wide range indictors slack labour market firms. for example, participation workforce develop unexpected ways, degree slack imply rate unemployment might change.7 that recovery is, i trust, finally underway complete surprise. the mpc provide massive amount monetary stimulus recent years. it effect arrest extend period threat severe turmoil euro area, come top erosion spend power rise commodity prices. monetary policy (and credit policy matter) work partly incentivising household firm bring forward future spending. they likely risk uncertainty continental doorstep great unusual. a immediate risk uncertainty receded, 5 see volker (2013), “central bank crossroad”. 6 on “risk channel” monetary policy, see stein hanson (2012), “monetary policy long-term real rates”; tucker (2012), “national balance sheet monetary policy: lesson past”; borio zhu (2012), “capital regulation, risk-taking monetary policy: miss link transmission mechanism?”. 7 this broadly comparable shift velocity money affect interpretation rate growth money stock monetary aggregate use target uk government 1980s. 4 bi central bankers’ speech uk monetary policy switch back on.8 with monetary stimulus maintained, within framework provide committee’s forward guidance, recovery continue underpin – although course road bumpy. that key element what, internal discussions, i call keynesian part bank’s policy response crisis. the fund lend scheme; liberalisation liquidity insurance bank system – extend collateral term repo scheme liberalise discount window facility; financial policy committee’s relate recommendation prudential regulation authority relax liquidity requirement bank – fell broad heading. “keynesian” support demand order help smooth adjustment economy go through. but central bank’s monetary liquidity intervention cannot remove need adjustment. the uk economy enter crisis much debt banking, household sector, government and, nation whole, externally. and uk enter crisis composition demand imbalanced – much public private consumption, little net trade. indeed, aggregate demand unbalance long economy’s productive capacity (and probably still is) unbalanced, investment capital follow pattern demand. for prosperity put secure foot long term, adjustment still needed. with one vital exception, engineer structural change economy responsibility central bank. the exception course safety soundness bank system, precondition broad monetary stability. an undercapitalised bank system would able smoothly supply sufficient credit aid recovery demand pick up, enable investment innovation efficiency. nor able much need help capital shift firm sector beneficiary new pattern global domestic demand. in view, may explain weakness productivity growth.9 the financial policy committee require recapitalisation uk’s big bank build society simply need underpin stability, is, also resilient bank system precondition sustain good balance recovery. new entrant bank bit, big incumbent bank need healthy too. their repair underway. that required, continue require, realism asset values, expect loss risk – pretending, take medicine. in sense, policy spirit hayek.10 so overall policy package combine keynes hayek. conclusion in wake massive crisis, recovery need active monetary, liquidity bank policy. beyond realm central banking, need supply-side reform – create optimism high income good investment opportunity future. 8 see minute monetary policy committee’s meet 7–8 november 2012: “at present time, possible elevate uncertainty desire reduce leverage mean real activity le responsive low borrow cost normal. but situation could easily reverse, traction low yield could stimulate demand output.” 9 see broadbent (2012), “productivity allocation capital”, page 30–33 monetary policy committee’s november 2012 inflation report: tucker (2013), annual report treasury select committee. 10 there echo bean (2013), “global aspect unconventional monetary policy”. bi central bankers’ speech 5 if recovery gain traction, mpc need avoid misperceptions likely course policy. the mpc use forward guidance help avoid possible misconceptions. the committee cannot make uncertainty supply side economy and, thus, degree slack go away. but adopt probe approach maintain eclectic approach assessment outlook, mpc wherewithal provide broadly right degree stimulus without risking, dilute commitment to, price stability. bi central bankers’ speech 1 sabine lautenschläger: supervisor without border speech m sabine lautenschläger deputy president deutsche bundesbank, even reception ese (the european supervisor education initiative) conference 2013 “the future european financial supervision”, frankfurt main, 26 september 2013. * * * 1. introduction good even all, lady gentlemen, warm welcome regional office hesse. for many you, day conference quite intensive. you listen lecture room goethe university, cover wide range topic include european supervisory systems, market bank structure well systemic risk macroprudential supervision; may intense discussion follow lectures. and back world famous author johann wolfgang goethe. “what i talk about?”, probably wondering. the unify theme art build “frankfurt, goethe, money”. and i begin core remark even quote point view fit perfectly situation bank supervisors. it quote goethe’s faust: “in begin deed”. under motto, i would like take three step together you. 2. the precede five year let u first go back step: precede five years, mark collapse lehman brother ensue crisis. a crisis shake foundation financial system european monetary union. the financial system’s weakness abruptly lay bare. we observed, push come shove, quickly banks’ inadequately small buff depleted, many institution require life support form government assistance. it also become instantly clear banks’ internal control system match complexity interconnect nature risk involved. however, crisis remain confine financial system. the focus soon turn government budgets, case already critical condition, threaten collapse weight rescue packages. the distress many country undergo make bank sector’s problem even worse. however, also time reform change. at initiative leadership g20, policymakers, regulator supervisor undertake develop programme comprehensive financial sector reforms, gradually implemented. this time also include establishment ese, european supervisor education initiative 2009 – project involve supervisor central banker well academics. ese joint venture set task ensure uniform train supervisor high level europe promote share knowledge researcher practitioners. after all: stable financial system require good rule also highly qualify supervisor order enforce standards. 3. the present let u take step forward – present. where stand now, five year since outset crisis? despite criticism seemingly sluggish pace reforms: i believe quite fair say make tangible progress. the implementation revise basel standard make bank resilient. we tighten requirement risk management expand horizon integrate 2 bi central bankers’ speech macroprudential knowledge. and item among many reform project currently ongoing; i’ll spare full list. however, decision probably important innovation take recently. i referring, course, single supervisory mechanism, ssm, europe. i high expectation ssm think help u detect risk european bank sector early stage future tackle rigorously. although i favour different legal basis, one could simplify matter lot give complex ssm governance structure, i nevertheless convince advantage ssm. one factor decisive success ssm: close constructive cooperation party involved. the ssm design system compose ecb centre national competent authority carry decentralise process procedures. a member supervisory team decision-making bodies, way meet high expectation ssm pull together. i especially look forward even close cooperation future colleague ecb national supervisory authorities. cooperation also guide star ese. the initiative already show u cooperation supervisor make work. a fellow board member rudolf böhmler illustrate morning, ese seminar attend participant multitude institution countries. this spirit cooperation exemplify important ssm. like u supervisors, ese, too, recently see eventful times. last year, saw considerable increase number seminar participant – noteworthy success confirmation excellent work responsible ese. these party include programme council, compose prove supervisory expert responsible keep content train measure date times. the steer committee ese secretariat naturally also play pivotal role. at juncture, i would like express sincere thank representative ese do make ese one lead train initiative supervisor europe. 4. the future let u take step – forward – venture look future. now european parliament approve draft legislation, ssm soon officially launched. we year full hard work ahead us. thankfully, preparation progress – high level group ecb national authorities’ representative many affiliate work groups, basic framework ssm already lay out. over come months, define detail cooperation ecb national supervisor codify framework regulation. we continue work organisational operational structure new supervisory regime institute efficient report process. however, opinion, balance-sheet assessment represent great challenge month ahead us. the ecb need clear picture actual risk face bank supervising. moreover, light need shed balance-sheet burden arise watch national supervisors. we therefore need thorough rigorous review balance-sheets. this first test ssm cooperation authority involved. though don’t much time accomplish extremely complex task, i believe that, act unison, succeed. one year now, preparation complete ssm take helm. in order ssm exploit advantages, one thing paramount: consistent supervisory approach incorporate strength individual national approach experiences. this common supervisory approach must build establish principle risk-orientation, proportionality well integrate micro macroprudential bi central bankers’ speech 3 supervision. it particularly important strike right balance ensure fair competition treat risk equally and, time, allow vary market bank structure far cater heterogeneous need real economy. however, supervisory approach must exist paper, must also infuse life. i see ese play important role here. ese support u supervisor convey new supervisory standard thus make crucial contribution consistent high-quality supervisory practice ssm. a supervisor system currently encompass 17, soon 18 countries, however, need technical expertise also communication teamworking skills. we need specialist also first-class networkers. this correspond ese’s approach, begin aim create joint european supervisory culture. and always traditionally social event ese seminar. this conference exception, i already look forward even excite stimulate conversation. 5. conclusion lady gentlemen, ese look back upon successful history, i convince ssm make good use ese’s expert knowledge experience. i wish organiser european supervisor education initiative help hand every success come challenges. there two think i want leave i invite help buffet look closely work art motto “frankfurt, goethe, money”. the first think is: bank union succeed every single one us, supervisor supervise alike, ready take action welcome new. the second think – address ese seminar participants, party involve bank union – must will keep learning, open new idea experiences, bring along “doubting thomases”, hesitant ones, ride. the bundesbank make every effort support process – words, deeds. thank attention. bi central bankers’

contribution gdp agriculture estimate 23 percent total. secondly, rural population constitute large share total population estimate 85 percent total population. there therefore large potential market save mobilization yet tap financial sector. look financial access statistics, 38% ugandan receive financial service formal informal sector moreover drill 20% use formal sector financial institution i.e. commercial bank tier 1, credit institution (tier 2) microfinance deposit take institution (tier 3). this mean nationwide, 62% ugandan serve financial institution group (formal, semiformal informal). further, disparity urban rural access financial service wide urban access 48% compare rural access 35%. this would suggest 12 million adult rural area access financial services. so

academics, policy makers, ngo’s general public put head together discus fiji’s economic issues. economists, know, differ opinion economic performance different fiji. however, discussion today help identify economic challenge constraint enable u debate solution may achieve full potential. let therefore applaud university south pacific organise important forum every year. i see role morning help

risk face set move ahead. the global economy on occasion make review first touch happen around us. a small open economy likely development offshore work way back fiji one form another. hence need ass risk opportunity area. the recovery global financial crisis (gfc), unfortunately, uneven rather short-lived. advance economy remain jolt poor confidence, high unemployment unsustainable public debt. some also grapple weak financial sectors. the emerge & develop economies, perform relatively better, also succumb late slowdown. the international monetary fund (imf) revise global economic growth downwards three time already year. we see world economy poise grow 3.1 percent. while growth 2014 also downgraded, good thing expect high year, 3.8 percent. 2 bi central bankers’ speech fiji’s major trade partners, economy important trade investment links, also spar face numerous challenge own. the u economy quite fragile face fiscal challenge poor confidence. across atlantic, euro zone mire prolong recession face record high unemployment. we talk number excess 25 percent, 1 4 people without job. it bad youth country 2 every 3 young people age 18 25 years, 66 percent, without jobs. many member country need bailouts struggle contain debt midst grow backlash public harsh austerity measure part deal strike respective government bailouts. close home, economic activity australia new zealand remain patchy growth remain uneven across sectors. however, economy expect growth excess 2.5 percent. the reserve bank australia low policy interest rate month new record low assist growth. in japan, spurt optimism follow massive fiscal monetary stimulus, although yet see spur sustain growth light weak demand across globe. a i allude earlier, emerge economies, main source global growth recent times, lose steam well. china’s heavy reliance investment credit spur growth past decade result vulnerability financial sector, government finance real estate, india face challenges, include high inflation. these, couple slow global demand bring growth prospect low decade. the fijian economy let turn fijian economy. in spite early comment, fortunate economy far somewhat shield global slowdown. our gdp expand 2.2 percent last year follow 1.9 percent expansion 2011. growth prospect expect improve around 3.2 percent year and, exception mine & quarry sector, sector contribute growth. the projection 2013, achieved, high since 2004 culmination detail re-assessment relevant data information available, well direct feedback wide cross section industry sectors. a may aware, past two week imf article iv mission visit country regular annual survey ass doing. we numerous discussion economy and, close grind “coal face”, share late number business sentiments. while agree every issue (again uncommon amongst economists), general consensus two fundamental issue regard economic growth. firstly, imf team agree economic growth 2013 would high 2012 (they forecast 3 percent) secondly, fiji potential even better! the fijian economy’s improve outlook validate host indicators. consumption activity upbeat last year reflection low personal income taxes, high inward remittances, improve employment prospect cheap easy access credit. new lend consumption purpose double $247 million first half year compare period last year. other indicator vat collections, import consumption good new vehicle sale also register significant annual gains. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the improve consumer confidence translate well business investor confidence. investment forecast around 28 percent gdp year, compare estimate 18 percent gdp last year government target 25 percent. we last briefly touch level back 1998 1981! recently, significant new investment note aviation, tourism, mine financial service sector government embark massive public infrastructure project roads, port bridges. our garment manufacture sector also show much great confidence high investment year envisaged. the surge investment well reflect new bank lend investment purposes, rise 154 percent first half year. our labour market improve line improve investor confidence, though unfortunately recent official number bureau statistics. the reserve bank’s late job advertisement survey show number vacant position advertise rise nearly 14 percent first half year. on production side mix results. gold production decline significantly last year. this year expectation significant pick gold output quite unfortunate mean unable capitalize exist high world market price. cane sugar production expect improve year decline last year due two major floods. data fiji sugar corporation reveal cane crush far year around 10 percent high last year sugar produce improvement tcts ratio. it especially hearten see improvement sugar reform slowly come fruition still work do critical industry ours. the tourism industry continue robust despite decline visitor arrival last year early part year due natural disasters. gross earn 2012 $1.3 billion momentum expect continue medium term. right peak tourism season data room occupancy visitor major markets, australia new zealand, favourable. lady gentlemen, reserve bank fiji maintain accommodative monetary policy stance since november 2011 bank system awash liquidity, put consistent downward pressure market interest rates. lend rate financial system hover historically low level capital money market rate also continue trend downwards. against background, domestic credit continue gain momentum private sector credit growth expand 9.6 percent june, signal improve confidence economy. our challenge whilst may applaud progress make raise growth prospect revitalise sector backdrop weak global economy domestic challenge – many hurdle face u could restrict u forge ahead path sustainable growth. we totally agree imf comment more. while encourage investment pick poise even surpass government’s target 25 percent year, maintain level remain important challenge move ahead. this require continue current monetary fiscal incentive time improve ease business. sentiment business community suggest still number hurdle register conduct business streamline good manage relevant 4 bi central bankers’ speech agencies. improve ease business encourage local investor also help attract much desire foreign investors. we also must mindful consumption investment lead growth cannot sustain long heavy import content. this counterproductive match gain export service sector negatively impact fragile external balance. our export sector small highly vulnerable change global demand domestic supply constraint shocks. in regard, policy aim export diversification promotion import substitution remain paramount before. restore sugar industry back glory also necessary give importance major foreign exchange earner indirect spin-off activity create western northern divisions. the government’s grant sugar mill improve efficiency sugar action group’s strategy improve cane yield farm productivity welcomed. while government’s commitment revitalize sugar industry encouraging, imperative plan bring fruition sooner rather later, industry able sustain without grants, subsidy preferential prices. however, well understand daunt difficult task cannot achieve overnight. lady gentlemen, poor inadequate infrastructure many years, deterrent growth, also frustrate experience fijians. improve infrastructure go long way towards boost agriculture well boost economy rural maritime areas. again government’s plan reform road port maintenance upgrade welcome hope constraint poor infrastructure long remain constraint move ahead. i note $420 million earmark road infrastructure project year appear already generate lot confidence activity business community, least large investment new trucks, utility van buses. keep government debt low another challenge, fiji, world over. public debt become topical issue day give awful experience europe require many country seek bailouts adopt harsh extremely unpopular austerity measures. small develop economy like fiji even disadvantage cannot sustain high public debt long due limit volatile revenue stream government need maintain adequate fiscal buff mitigate future crises. fiji’s government debt currently estimate 50 percent gdp. while bite fortunate relatively low external government debt, around 15 percent gdp, shield u exchange rate risks, government must remain commit reduce total debt further. appropriate fiscal consolidation, effective tax collection, civil public sector reform creation new high tax industries, mining, provide necessary avenue reduce debt sustainable level perhaps late imf benchmark 40 percent gdp. lady gentleman, i elaborate major macroeconomic challenges, others worth mention also provide necessary base sustain economic growth move ahead. these include well know issue land reform, raise agricultural productivity, solid clear progress towards parliamentary democracy ensure inclusive growth all. for many these, great stride make still work-in-progress i wish best relevant agency involve spearhead initiatives. conclude remark let conclude highlight reserve bank see current macroeconomic strengths. bi central bankers’ speech 5 we make significant turnaround contraction 2009 three year consecutive economic growth. in addition, growth succeed year 2010 higher.

authority singapore, 4th pan-asian regulatory summit, singapore, 25 september 2013. * * * mr lea bachatene, vp & manage director (asia pacific), thomson reuters distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, good morning. exactly five year ago, month, lehman brother collapse unleash financial crisis unmatched scale impact. the crisis expose deep fault line global financial system spur far-reaching financial regulatory reforms, aim build resilient financial industry good serf need real economy. this morning, i take stock impact regulatory reforms: • progress make make global financial system safer; • possible unintended consequence must watch for. a member financial stability board, basel committee bank supervision, various international regulatory forums, ma strong proponent early implementer many reforms. but flinch go international standard necessary refrain measure jurisdiction regard relevant context. progress regulatory reform let start progress regulatory reforms. increase capacity absorb loss a centrepiece reform bank new basel iii capital standards. basel iii three things. • first, raise quantity capital bank must hold. by provide buff bank absorb losses, capital help minimise spillover rest system. • second, basel iii raise quality capital bank must hold. the crisis show common equity effective capital instrument absorb loss write-downs. • third, basel iii bring back banks’ balance sheet many off-balance sheet exposure apply appropriate capital charge them. many bank rescue 2008 capital adequacy ratio well excess minimum requirement then. they get trouble many risky off-balance sheet exposure hold capital against. singapore fully implement basel iii capital requirements, two year ahead timeline prescribe basel committee. and 2015, singapore-incorporated bank meet capital requirement 2% point high basel iii minimum – effect surcharge reflect systemic importance economy financial system. there global capital standard insurance industry. this lacuna need plugged. but international association insurance supervisor (“iais”) take lead formulate standard risk-based solvency regime insurers. the eu build develop detail capital standard know solvency ii. many jurisdiction review rule intent align iais standards. 2 bi central bankers’ speech singapore among first jurisdiction asia introduce risk-based capital (“rbc”) framework insurers, 2005. in 2012, ma embark review enhance framework, know “rbc 2”, take account new iais standard best practices, include relevant aspect solvency ii. ma conduct quantitative study ass impact insurance industry proposal rbc 2. there global capital standard capital market service providers. the international organisation security commission (“iosco”) has, however, set principle solvency security market intermediaries. base principles, ma implement risk-based capital framework capital market service licensees. strengthen liquidity buff the second important area reform set – first time – international standard bank liquidity. bank business transform short-term liability (mainly deposits) long-term asset (mainly loans). this fundamental mis-match maturity open bank risk may able finance short-term liability fall due. even solvent bank lot capital fail liquidity risk well-managed. the new liquidity coverage ratio (“lcr”) set global minimum standard bank liquidity. essentially, lcr framework require bank adequate stock high quality liquid asset convert cash survive 30-day period stress. in singapore liquidity rule long time. our risk-based minimum liquid asset framework require every bank hold minimum percentage qualify liability liquid assets. we look adopt basel iii lcr rules, enhancement suit domestic conditions. • although basel iii apply lcr framework internationally active banks, propose extend lcr requirement bank singapore first instance grant various relief basis risk-mitigating circumstances. • we also tight definition qualify eligible liquid asset recognise equity mortgage-backed securities. ma issue consultation paper implementation lcr framework carefully consider industry feedback. constrain leverage the third important area reform constrain build excessive leverage. at height crisis 2008, bank industry force market reduce leverage manner lead downward pressure asset prices, turn lead losses, decline bank capital, contraction credit. even bank high risk-based capital adequacy ratio find excessively leveraged. basel iii’s leverage ratio seek set 3% floor amount tier 1 capital bank need hold relative total exposure. the ratio design non-risk base measure complement risk-sensitive capital adequacy ratios. it act like stop-gap constrain overall size balance sheet, especially give uncertainty involve risk model bank use calculate capital needs. but leverage ratio – precisely non-risk base measure – cannot substitute risk-based capital requirement set high level become bind constraint banks. if so, bank may perverse incentive increase exposure risky asset earn high return capital. the final calibration definition leverage ratio expect finalise 2017, minimum leverage ratio requirement come effect 2018. singapore-incorporated bank comfortably meet current test minimum 3% leverage ratio. bi central bankers’ speech 3 make otc derivative trade safe the fourth fundamental area reform otc derivative market. the crisis highlight opaque inter-connections across financial institution engage trade complex derivative contract over-the-counter lead rapid contagion systemic crisis liquidity suddenly dry up. reform focus four areas: standardisation derivative contracts; central clearing; high margin requirement non-centrally clear trades; mandatory report trades. in particular, report trade repository provide much-needed transparency exposure across market participants. ma take step implement trade report regime singapore. financial institution book prescribe otc derivative singapore require report trade trade repository license mas. the report framework run next month, start interest rate credit derivatives. the degree standardisation contract asset class higher, start contract provide smooth phase-in. we receive feedback industry operational difficulty obtain customer consent order report counterparty information trade repositories. we look amend legislation address issue. end too-big-to-fail the high-profile, public rescue many large, systemically important financial institution last crisis galvanise powerful resolve end “too-big-to-fail” problem. but prove one challenge task face global regulators. to sure, fsb basel committee make good progress several fronts. • first, identify list global systemically important bank (g-sibs). • second, set additional loss absorbency requirement g-sibs reduce probability institution failing. • third, ongoing work resolution framework minimise cross-border negative externality create failure. at time, major jurisdiction embark plan reform bank structure bid end “too-big-to-fail”. • in us, volcker rule prohibit us-operating bank engage proprietary trade acquire retain ownership interest hedge fund private equity fund. • in uk, vickers commission recommend ring-fencing retail bank activities, subject ring-fenced entity high capital requirements. • in eu, liikanen report propose mandatory fence banks’ proprietary trade market make activity rest bank group, activity exceed certain threshold, high capital charge impose investment bank ring-fence. to extent structural measure help simplify business model facilitate resolvability large complex global bank groups, help reduce risk impact failures. but clear benefit measure outweigh cost instances. first, worth consider whether size complexity critical factors. the global financial crisis start large universal bank large global banks, narrow specialise players: northern rock uk, investment bank like bear stearns 4 bi central bankers’ speech lehman brothers. interestingly, liikanen report observe business model perform particularly well poorly crisis. second, remain unclear structural reform measure make bank bank group safe culture excessive risk-taking curtail risk governance framework strengthened. ma subscribe universal bank model premise separation risky non-risky activity matter much ensure risk well manage wherever is. • for domestic banks, ma impose structural measures. the focus instead ensure risk management capability commensurate complexity activity capital liquidity buff healthy. • for foreign bank significant presence retail market, ma require local incorporation retail operations. the bank choose subsidiarise entire operation within legal entity continue operate wholesale bank business branch structure. there retail ring-fence required. unintended consequence it imperative press regulatory reform agenda succumb reform fatigue. but even so, need mindful unintended consequences. inconsistent implementation rule the first unintended consequence inconsistent application rule across jurisdiction across sectors. inconsistent application rule across jurisdiction lead risk regulatory arbitrage. take example, new capital rules. it laudable within short period promulgation, 25 27 member jurisdiction basel committee issue final set basel iii regulations. but implementation uneven. the basel committee conduct study consistency risk-weighted asset measure bank book internal model approach. it find considerable variation across bank average risk-weighted asset credit risk. a material part variation due different bank supervisory practices. such difference measurement could result capital ratio varying, extreme cases, much two percentage point either direction. to enhance consistency implementation, basel committee consider three steps: • first, improve public disclosure regulatory data collection help market regulator good understand risk-weighted asset derived; • second, narrow range acceptable model choice banks; • third, provide additional supervisory guidance model approvals. inconsistent application rule across entity carry similar activity lead issue shadow banking. the high capital liquidity requirement require basel iii may create incentive activity conduct outside regulate bank sector. the fsb estimate shadow bank constitute 25% total financial system, regulation bank still tightening, analyst expect shadow bank sector continue grow. but suggest intermediate credit non-bank channel discouraged. the shadow bank system provide market participant corporation useful alternative source fund liquidity. some non-bank entity may bi central bankers’ speech 5 specialise expertise enable provide certain credit intermediation service efficiently low risk. shadow bank need bad word finance. what need watch accumulation risk shadow bank sector potential spill-over risk regulate bank sector. the fsb set approach monitor shadow bank system identify possible regulatory measure mitigate shadow bank risks. in singapore, ma take step limit opportunity regulatory arbitrage bank- non-bank sector adopt broadly consistent rule similar activities, even conduct different type entities. for instance, capital requirement banks, insurance companies, capital market intermediary broadly align similar type risks, deter regulatory arbitrage. cross-border implication national rule the second unintended consequence cross-border implication national rules. • take example, u cftc’s otc swap rules. these rule apply financial institution operate outside u include foreign-domiciled financial institution foreign branch u financial institutions. • another recent example: european market infrastructure regulation require financial market infrastructure subject european rule rule deem equivalent europe’s provide service eu players. these rule well-intended seek address genuine regulatory concern jurisdictions. but extend national rule across border often give rise overlap regulations, create additional compliance cost internationally active financial institutions. if conflict different national requirements, burden comply multiple set rule significant, may prevent execution trade cross-border basis. the risk global derivative foreign exchange businesses, example, might become trap within regional borders, create fragment markets. cross-border application national rule may also risk complicate home-host collaboration, principle consolidate supervision, cross-border resolution. • a bi work paper publish april 2013 caution may difficult design resolution plan global bank require different national regulation operate different business models. • an imf staff discussion paper publish may 2013 highlight difference national structural reform could lead cross-border regulatory arbitrage global banks, pose challenge consolidate supervision. in event imposition national regulation across border unavoidable, need robust mutual recognition framework place. such framework base outcome-based approach, line-by-line correspondence rules. • we encourage regulator u europe adopt substitute compliance equivalence assessment approach entity comply set rule apply jurisdiction operate. • ma support substitute compliance equivalence assessment important measure avoid potentially duplicative inconsistent rules, particularly entity international operations. in area otc derivative trading, ma put place rule infrastructure support cross-border operation help reduce uncertainty industry. to allay concern industry regulatory burden comply home 6 bi central bankers’ speech host regulations, participate equivalence assessment u european regimes. thus far, esma, european security regulator, recommend european commission singapore framework broadly equivalent europe’s, pave way central counterparties singapore offer service european participants. we also submit cftc application substitute compliance respect requirement u bank operate here. we active discussion cftc, work substitute compliance determination, appropriate, otc regulatory regime come force. impact trade finance long-term finance the final unintended consequence impact trade finance long-term finance. there concern various regulatory reform take together may lead pull-back trade finance long-term investment financing. the global regulatory community national government become increasingly sensitise concerns. in area trade finance, basel committee consult world bank, world trade organisation, relevant bodies. a number adjustment make capital liquidity rule facilitate trade finance. • in area capital rules, basel committee waive one year maturity floor certain trade finance instrument advance internal ratings-based approach credit risk. it also waive sovereign risk-weight floor certain trade finance-related claim use standardise approach credit risk. • in area liquidity, basel committee issue guidance national supervisor apply relatively low run-off rate trade finance commitments. preliminary data suggest availability cost trade finance greatly impact to-date implementation basel iii. spread normalise post-crisis price appear influence broad macro factor competition. further, many well-capitalised banks, especially asia, well-placed operate new regulatory regime; many step up. we continue monitor closely impact regulatory change trade finance. trade lifeblood asian economies. but big challenge long-term financing, especially infrastructure. it may case post-crisis financial system may adequately structure provide certain type long-term financing. • first, longer-term corporate project finance loan already attract high capital charge compare short term loans. couple increase overall capital requirement basel iii, may create disincentive long-term loans. • second, meet liquidity requirements, bank may substitute long-term lend activity short-term lending. in calculate net stable fund ratio, low weight assign loan maturity le year. • third, solvency ii, impose high risk charge longer-dated assets, may result insurer de-risking take shorter-dated assets. • fourth, interaction central clearing, margining capital requirement may impact variety liquidity derivative long-dated interest rate swap use hedge risk associate long-term financing. bi central bankers’ speech 7 there may scope intelligent, risk-sensitive fine-tune regulation: • the design risk weight insurer penalise hold good quality long term assets, match long term liabilities. • the preferential treatment sovereign debt bank regulation re-examined, bank disincentivised hold good quality, long term corporate debt. • good calibration risk weight securitisation bank insurer may necessary. but fundamental solution lie dilute regulatory requirements. policymakers also focus way develop sustainable alternative source long-term finance. at time, must recognise immediate constraint infrastructure development asia finance per se supply bankable project acceptable risk-return profile attract bank investors. we need integrate solution involve risk-sharing arrangement bring together bank non-bank capital. in singapore, work partnership diverse group stakeholders, help build ecosystem support long-term finance unlock supply bankable projects. • multilateral agency well-rated public sector entity could provide guarantee credit wrap would allow bank reduce risk exposure long-term projects, thereby encourage originate loans. • bank loan could structure way facilitate seamless migration bank capital markets. • institutional investor pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth fund could invest project bonds, infrastructure debt funds, securitised project loans, take risk banks’ balance sheets. conclusion let conclude. we make reasonable progress make global finance safer. the regulatory reform since crisis help strengthen resilience financial system. but work far complete. we must forget regulation must complement rigorous supervision sound risk management. we cannot rely much regulation alone make finance safer. a jacques de larosiere remind us: “strong, intrusive supervision well careful risk assessment management banker essence. they never replace rules.” put differently, culture prudence risk governance good guarantee safety soundness rule capital liquidity draw up. finally, want finance safe also purposeful. regulation must seek eliminate risk must impact-sensitive. let u lose sight big picture: sound financial system able play vital role intermediation, support sustain economic growth help create opportunity individual enterprises. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: 2012 bernácer prize award ceremony honour

member executive board deutsche bundesbank, 18th annual bank insurance conference “making finance work high capital world”, organize bank america merrill lynch, london, 24 september 2013. * * * 1 introduction lady gentleman many thank invite year’s conference. it real pleasure speak today i spend many year career private sector. today, however, i speak central banker thus regulator’s point view. from time time bank regulator portray oppose forces. to me, seem bite mark – least i know side rather well. in end share objective: stable financial system. and natural start point build stable financial system individual bank. bank elementary build block financial system ensure financial stability need resilient banks. 2 what define resilient bank? but resilient bank? to begin with, resilient bank able withstand shocks. a resilient bank enjoy confidence investor customers. thus, receive fund – wholesale retail – adequate price even period stress. but investor customer recognize resilient bank? be like famous giraffe: hard describe know see it? well, certainly time case. usually, however, resilient bank specific characteristic set apart banks. in remark today i would like discus three characteristic – three pillar resilient bank rest. 2.1 capital liquidity buff capital liquidity buff regard centre pillar. capital provide cushion absorb loss time stress. and benefit hindsight, widely acknowledge prior crisis banks’ capital buff neither high solid enough. the true liquidity. banks’ role financial intermediation make particularly vulnerable liquidity risks. and lack liquidity break solvent bank’s neck. after all, liquidity squeeze define element financial crisis 2008. in term strengthen individual banks’ capital liquidity buffers, come long way. the basel iii rule require bank hold good capital. these rule since transpose european legislation. once implemented, bank able absorb big loss remain go concern – resilient. although implementation gradual, bank already become eager build capital buff early on. in so, respond increase market expectations. in germany, instance, 12 major bank international focus increase tier 1 capital ratio 13.2% 15.3% mid-2013 year-to-year basis. 2 bi central bankers’ speech however, bank still raise capital adjust balance sheet position accordingly. regard issue liquidity, have, first time ever, agree international standard. i sure new standard increase banks’ resilience liquidity shocks, promote stable fund profile enhance overall liquidity management. however, analytical work need do – least liquidity regulation uncharted territory. moreover, lot side effect unintended consequence need fully think through. 2.2 profitability the second pillar resilient bank rest profitability. bank profitable lose trust investor customers, especially time stress. also, able build reserves, instance retain earnings. this weaken time stress. prior crisis, many banks’ ambition increase shareholder value lead expectation return equity 20%. generate return order may profitable necessarily sustainable. but bank need business model profitable sustainable. i fully aware, though, easy say done. just take look german banks. like many international peers, german bank pressure number challenge several year – crisis-related, others structural. in addition, german bank market still highly dense highly competitive. for reasons, many bank still need optimise business model – instance, diversify fund source give business unit whose risk cannot manage effectively. those bank cannot adapt swiftly enough change condition exit market. now, discuss issue profitability, often hold regulation increase banks’ cost reduce earnings. it certainly true regulatory requirement entail cost banks. however, i would take balance view cost regulation. bank tend overlook cost crises, usually bear taxpayers. take cost account put banks’ criticism perspective. at social level regulation still generate net benefit. 2.3 good governance have say that, let u turn third pillar resilient bank. a resilient bank sound governance structure commit high ethical standards. investor customer need confidence bank manage prudently. these aspect gain lot attention aftermath recent scandals, manipulation libor similar financial benchmarks. these case misconduct spoil confidence twofold way. firstly, trustworthiness bank involve impaired. and negative consequence bank sector whole. bank work hard order heal wounds. secondly, reliability, robustness representativeness financial benchmark call question. without doubt, integrity credibility benchmark-setting process urgent need general overhaul. we know: trust gain long period time may shatter quickly. in sense, trust similar humpty dumpty: fragile and, shattered, king’s horse king’s men able put back together. in vein, effort strengthen banks’ resilience undo instantly bank cannot avoid severe case misconduct future. bi central bankers’ speech 3 this also apply banks’ risk management capacities. on issue, however, much progress made. the requirement adequate internal control system appropriate governance structure tighten substantially. let elaborate refer reform banks’ compensation schemes. in run-up crisis, asymmetry compensation term risk reward lead short-termism excessive risk-taking employees. inadequate pay reward system contribute large – case extreme – absolute level compensation. that turn leave firm le capacity absorb loss risk materialised. to safeguard financial stability, compensation scheme financial sector must good align long-term performance firm prudent risk-taking. international guideline effect develop financial stability board. to date, implementation guideline still see good progress. but much work still lie ahead national authority banks. they ensure effective implementation sound compensation policy lead prudent risk-taking behaviour employees. the strong compensation requirement europe set legislative package capital requirement important step direction. but achieve last change behaviour culture take time stamina. bank need undertake effort publicly disclose easy-to-understand consistent data compensation structure allow comparison across jurisdictions. 3 look beyond individual bank to sum characteristic resilient banks, state well-capitalised enough liquidity, profitable sustainable business model manage prudently. first foremost, certainly banks’ responsibility fulfil criteria. it responsibility regulators, however, put place stable regulatory framework. nevertheless, design framework look beyond individual bank. experience recent year show certain dynamic jeopardise entire financial system even though single entity believe sound: whole sum parts. therefore, set regulatory standard increase resilience individual bank necessary mean sufficient. authority broaden perspective cover financial system whole. they take account problem systemic risk. systemic risk create cyclical structural developments, exposure concentration externality cause interconnectedness financial institutions. 3.1 the “too-big-to-fail”-problem the first step regard acknowledge even resilient bank fail. and might become problem fail bank large interconnected. in case drag bank cause systemic crisis. consequently, ensure systemically important financial institution (or sifis) fail without destabilise whole financial system. what need insolvency framework tune interconnectedness complexity financial sector. major step already take regard international level. the financial stability board already present key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions. these endorse g20 head state government november 2011. since then, work way transpose new international standard national law. a draft directive recovery resolution credit institution 4 bi central bankers’ speech present eu level. this proposal clearly set forth sequence liability fail financial institution – shareholder creditor first line bear losses, rightly so. 3.2 the bank-sovereign nexus nevertheless, still another aspect interconnectedness take account: link banks’ balance sheet public finances. the crisis expose vicious circle connection. if many bank run financial difficulty time, threaten stability entire financial system. government often option bail bank prevent system collapsing. this cost lot money. look ireland, example: rescue bank raise country’s 2010 budget deficit 30% gdp. by token, government finance run difficulties, cause problem bank – firstly, many bank large government bond hold and, secondly, general economic situation initially worsen government adjust finances. this feedback loop bank sovereign sever order promote financial stability. one measure would establish resolution regime bank i already discussed. have place would shield government rescue bank taxpayer money. another measure refer capital requirement banks, i also discussed. the objective ensure banks’ economic situation long depend state public finances. we achieve stop give government debt preferential regulatory treatment loan securities. government debt back level capital adequately reflect risks. at time cap impose bank sovereign debt holdings. and side note: appropriate capital rule cap lend government also discipline effect national fiscal economic policy. former imf chief economist kenneth rogoff consider effect strong strict fiscal rules. 4 conclusion lady gentlemen, resilient bank essential build block financial stability. with view regulation come long way since recent crisis. we reform regulatory framework way help increase banks’ resilience. at time acknowledge fact look beyond individual bank want safeguard financial stability. thus, although right track, probably move bite fast regard implement new rule standards. but bank themselves? have finally understand role recent crisis? have look beyond loss realise burden put society? i argue look beyond individual bank safeguard financial stability i refer systemic perspective. but also look beyond bank capture personal perspective. eventually, bankers’ attitude culture essential build block financial stability. here still need change. banker subscribe idea financial system is, essence, service provider real economy. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 martin flodén: my view monetary policy household debt speech mr martin flodén, deputy governor sverige riksbank, swedbank, stockholm, 24 september 2013. * * * this first speech since take post deputy governor riksbank. since i start spring i take part two monetary policy meetings. on occasion i enter reservation majority decision advocate low repo rate. it therefore seem natural devote speech today explain view monetary policy reason reservations. should monetary policy take account households’ high rise indebtedness? this question central monetary policy recent year also first monetary policy decisions. i consider clear riksbank responsibility safeguard financial stability prevent crisis link credit granting. however, clear consequence responsibility regard conduct monetary policy practice. i shall explain reason recent monetary policy meetings. i also intend comment new framework macroprudential policy may affect view monetary policy. however, i shall begin brief description view, riksbank’s view, economic situation. positive sign risk remain in recent month able see positive sign swedish economy, also abroad. confidence rise household corporate sector sweden, sign unemployment falling. in euro area, gdp increase second quarter, six quarter row fall gdp. here, too, confidence indicator give positive signals. however, one must remember economy still long way go reach normal status. gdp growth inflation low level sweden euro area. and still large downside risk economic developments. in euro area, weak public sector finance problem banks’ balance sheet scarcely improve recent months. in unite states, full effect sequester yet realised, also uncertainty debt ceiling raise autumn. growth rate large emerge market like china india fallen, albeit high levels. previously, international capital tend move towards emerge market interest rate low develop economies. however, yield u government bond rise since spring, capital flow change direction. the outflow capital mean exchange rate weakening, may improve countries’ international competitiveness contribute maintain high level economic activity. but large fluctuation growth rates, capital flow exchange rate problematic create uncertainty regard economic development emerge markets. a divide swedish economy the swedish economy dependent development abroad, course affect financial crisis economic downturn recent years. in international comparison, overall quantity gdp employment nevertheless develop well since financial crisis. 2 bi central bankers’ speech however, behind overall picture divide, household finance particular strong. their disposable income increase every year since crisis (see figure 1). growth consumption also good. house price loan household increase rapidly,

sector limit build-up household debt time. in situation, evident monetary policy manage balance inflation, economic activity risk overly rapid increase house price household credit. let elaborate think little here. monetary policy must take financial risk account the concern lend household increase rapidly lead majority member riksbank’s executive board vote hold repo rate high level would otherwise justified. i enter reservation decision advocate low repo rate, reason i return later. despite reservations, i share majority’s concern rapid increase household debt. and i consider monetary policy should, principle, take account financial imbalance risk may arise result monetary policy conducted. in way compatible riksbank’s mandate? accord sverige riksbank act, objective riksbank’s activity maintain price stability. moreover, riksbank shall promote safe efficient payment system. in addition, preliminary work act state riksbank, without prejudice price stability target, support goal general economic policy view maintain sustainable level growth high rate employment. at riksbank consider task promote safe efficient payment system broad mean is, practice, matter take responsibility promote stability financial system.2 but actually task justify monetary policy take account rapid expansion household borrowing. it namely case preliminary work sverige riksbank act emphasise monetary policy instrument shall use maintain price stability, thus promote safe efficient payment system.3 we sometimes say monetary policy shall take financial risk account, difficult stabilise inflation around target household force rapidly reduce debts.4 such difficulty could arise, course, consideration inflation target mainly justify let monetary policy take financial risk account. instead i perceive take financial risk account follow task “supporting objective general economic policy aim achieve sustainable growth”. a monetary policy lead unhealthy build-up credit financial imbalance scarcely compatible sustainable growth. but task, like task stabilise economic activity, subordinate inflation target. monetary policy’s consideration financial risk must therefore weigh inflation target economic developments. 1 for tool sufficient meet inflation target attain balance development economic activity, necessary economy mostly suffer demand shocks, supply shocks. this observation sometimes call divine coincidence, expression coin blanchard gali (2007). 2 see riksbank (2013a) p. 3. 3 see bill 1997/98:40, p. 54. 4 see, example, riksbank (2013b). bi central bankers’ speech 5 from principle practice the question principle consideration financial risk imbalance put practice monetary policy. how balance different task managed? when determine must consider whether tool monetary policy suitable manage financial risks, whether concern regard household debt justify effect monetary policy imbalance risk concern us. i intend conduct deep discussion link monetary policy tool today. a express riksbank (2010), i note primarily monetary policy, efficient regulatory framework supervision important prevent financial imbalances. the way monetary policy take account financial risk may therefore depend formulation regulatory framework supervision. i shall return question i discus new framework macroprudential policy. household indebtedness worryingly high also, i wish get detail discussion whether concern rise house price household debt recent decade justified.5 it clear fully understand underlie factor are. we therefore know whether upturn largely explain fundamental factor whether reflect imbalance build economy. fundamental able disregard include fact house construction low number years. a low level construction, combine grow population move metropolitan area also contribute rise house prices, ultimately increase debt. and conversion rental property tenant-owned property also contribute increase debt. a aspect household save high increase time debt increased. but high indebtedness probably mean economy sensitive shocks, even explain fundamentals. an economic downturn could reinforce household large debt try increase save reduce consumption. moreover, hardly rule possibility households’ increase indebtedness recent year least partly cause unrealistically low expectation future mortgage rates. in opinion, therefore principle justify monetary policy take account rapid increase household indebtedness. risk low repo rate a question thus way monetary policy lead financial imbalance build up. international academic research discus several potential problem arise central bank hold policy rate low level long period time. perhaps common problem mention investor seek asset high yield, also high risk. one many reason behaviour could portfolio manager require attain minimum return portfolios. this behaviour risk cause unwarranted rise asset price interest rate low.6 5 there lively debate question. one important contribution discussion riksbank’s commission inquiry risk swedish house market (riksbank 2011). the national institute economic research (2013) svensson (2013a) example new contribution debate, claim house price household indebtedness comprise evident problem. 6 see rajan (2005). 6 bi central bankers’ speech another possible problem low interest rate monetary policy stimulus help weak company get along without deal problems. in way, necessary structural transformation economy may postponed. there also risk stimulus help bank struggle along weak balance sheets, inhibit credit grant economy.7 the problem i mention nevertheless appear le relevant current development sweden. but i would like mention two potential problem link low interest rates, i think justify concern swedish economy. my first source concern perhaps little far-fetched.8 let u say reason find situation repo rate low many household heavily indebted. in situation repo-rate increase could large negative consequence indebted household consequently economy whole. then household might believe future economic policy formulate negative consequence avoid alleviated. they may choose take even high debt believe – without justification – economic policy take consideration. and problem risk increase long repo rate keep low level. figure 5 households’ mortgage-rate expectation one, two three year ahead per cent

2013forward rate, 10 september 2013the riksbank's repo-rate path 8 bi central bankers’ speech recent monetary policy meet i nevertheless advocate cut repo rate even lower. there several factor behind stance. firstly, low repo rate would mean cpif inflation return 2 per cent even fast resource utilisation balance forecast (see figure 7). figure 7 more expansionary monetary policy effect accord riksbank’s macro model ram sources: statistic sweden riksbank secondly, i see incipient credibility problem want formulate monetary policy appear well-balanced even combine assessment make outside riksbank. the problem i see base combination inflation clearly undershoot target, riksbank’s inflation forecast optimistic analysts, executive board’s repo-rate path indicate tight monetary policy market analyst expect repo-rate path revise time time. i say situation good cut rate immediately rather continue present repo-rate path perceive outsider entirely credible. however, problem become little le important recent month analysts’ forecast inflation repo rate revise up. thirdly, self-evident take account household debt mean set high repo rate would otherwise done. the current repo rate, 1 per cent, undeniably low. in long run, repo rate raise much high levels. but cannot raise repo rate see inflation clearly begin move towards target 2 per cent. and happen course depend monetary policy. if cut repo rate now, inflation rise fast towards target. if repo rate leave unchanged take long inflation begin rise, turn mean take long time repo rate raised. it even self-evident inflation return target level long run monetary policy tight. if worry long period low repo rate give rise unjustified upturn house price indebtedness, perhaps ensure conduct monetary policy mean

rate increase inflation raise repo rate slightly fast come period inflation accelerate (see figure 7). admittedly, preliminary assessment within riksbank, base model calculation combine empirical relationships, indicate large repo-rate cut now, follow fast increase future would entail slightly high risk link household indebtedness repo-rate path advocate majority followed. however, difference risk outlook two alternative almost negligible. a low repo rate fast increase come period seem good monetary policy, weigh risk opportunity return inflation target sooner balance resource utilisation (see figure 7).10 the assessment calculation i refer base general framework present monetary policy report publish july.11 it entirely clear reason translate recommendation practical monetary policy. we work issue within bank. it scarcely need say assessment calculation i imply today uncertain, remain uncertain even work issue progress further.12 further measure need strengthen financial stability in conclusion, i would like discus new framework macroprudential policy affect view monetary policy conducted. it good one single authority, finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory authority), give clear responsibility decision supervisory measures. in way, avoid problem different authority may try put responsibility others, could arise responsibility share several authorities. at time, positive several authorities, include riksbank, give role play work macroprudential policy new financial stability council. identify analyse factor give rise financial imbalance remain important part riksbank’s work. the riksbank need analysis several reasons. a i mention earlier, riksbank responsibility promote safe efficient payment system. we must also understand monetary policy risk contribute financial imbalance arising. moreover, development economy prof unsustainable affect way inflation develop type monetary policy appropriate conduct. the financial stability council give u forum shall openly present analysis financial risk recommendation supervisory measures. in recent monetary policy update forecast base new macroprudential policy measure introduced. but view suitable monetary policy affect measure implemented? the answer depend entirely measure implement effects. 10 the scenario show figure 7 primarily regard illustration different alternatives. the repo-rate path coincide one i advocate monetary policy meetings. 11 the riksbank (2013c). 12 a central element uncertainty repo rate affect degree household indebtedness. the riksbank’s estimate imply debt ratio increase repo rate cut, increase small. svensson (2013b) say hand low repo rate would entail low debt ratio. but model real reason concern household indebtedness, regardless repo rate affect degree household indebtedness. for example, allow households’ interest-rate expectation become unjustifiably low repo rate cut. 10 bi central bankers’ speech supervisory measure direct effect financial risk imbalance limit possibility particularly vulnerable households, company bank take certain decisions. however, measure may also indirect effect risk imbalances, side effect economy affect cost capital general demand situation. an example measure probably first foremost direct effect mortgage cap. this affect primarily small group highly-indebted household expect contribute substantially prevent financial imbalance arising. but mortgage cap scarcely major effect general demand economy, cost capital typical household. an example measure affect cost capital high risk weight mortgages. such measure would probably lead increase mortgage rate relation lend rates. and high risk weight would probably also push average lend rate give repo rate, least short run. a i practice let concern households’ rapid build-up debt affect view repo rate set today, measure first type, is, measure directly limit vulnerable households’ opportunity become remain heavily indebted, would probably also little effect choice repo rate repo-rate path. on hand, measure entail increase average lend rate weaken general demand would justify cut repo rate. the purpose would counteract effect supervisory measure total economic developments. however, supervision measure could nevertheless affect financial imbalances, instance, change level household mortgage rate relation companies’ borrow rates. further macroprudential policy measure thus need change view monetary policy appropriate now. however, measure nevertheless important monetary policy reduce risk uncertainties. it easy

i want first address question forward guidance important japan. a know, bank attempt overcome mild deflation last japan nearly 15 year since 1998 achieve 2 percent price stability target adopt january 2013. the rate price change since 1998 average minus 0.3 percent. before proceed speech, let pause moment. i would like bring question i often encounter abroad. that what problem mild deflation japan unemployment rate remain low even throughout global financial crisis? 2 bi central bankers’ speech long-standing mild deflation it legitimate question. it true japan’s unemployment rate much low economies: high level reach far global financial crisis 5.5 percent july 2009. certainly, deflation persistent, mild avoid deflationary spiral. on surface, therefore, may difficult comprehend japan’s fundamental problems. my response normally provide follows. mild deflation exert adverse effect japan’s economy reflect long-standing negative output gap (chronic demand shortage), low expectation future economic market growth firms, well sluggish expectation future income growth household (chart 1). deflation also closely associate long-term yen appreciation trend add pessimism firm already struggle maintain price competitiveness. these phenomenon – together decline total population, rapid pace age population, slow pace structural reform – discourage firm actively engage business fix investment innovative activities, lead household save grow concern future, prompt financial institution undertake risk-averse investment strategies. in environment, household take low price good service grant develop deflation-oriented mindset thus believe price increase. in addition, firm follow deflation-oriented price behavior hence use sale price rival purchase behavior customer set prices, even supply-demand balance improves. moreover, financial institution become increasingly accustom deflation-oriented investment strategies, shift investment risk asset (such stocks, corporate bonds, mutual funds, loans, real estate, foreign securities) safe asset (such japanese government bond [jgbs], deposits, cash). why 2 percent target adopted? a i mention earlier, january year bank establish target 2 percent achieve price stability. i would like explain course decide on. in essence, japan’s economy quite depress gradually erode time. give background reason set 2 percent target, view, belief deflation harmful economy inflation, important achieve comparable level (mild) inflation major advance economies.1 the bank’s aim achieve 2 percent price stability target particularly challenging. it imply medium- long-term inflation expectation market public need increase anchor around 2 percent level. no major economy ever face undertaking. in formal economic terms, important point raise inflation expectation toward 2 percent, phillips curve shift upward slope steepens, thereby enhance responsiveness price change supply-demand balance (chart 2). forward guidance use anchor inflation expectation i stress “forward guidance” essential anchor inflation expectations, particularly case japan, requirement firmly establish 2 percent medium- long-term inflation expectation mind market public. we note bank need undertake accommodative monetary policy two main aims: (1) achieve economic recovery, (2) anchor inflation expectation target level. 1 see sayuri shirai, “japan’s economic activity, prices, monetary policy: monetary policy past present,” speech meet business leader asahikawa, bank japan, 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 3 contrast situation economies’ central banks. their inflation expectation already well-anchored target level inflation, thus, primary aim achieve economic recovery (see section iii). in japan, second aim anchor inflation expectation require bank first help transform deflation-oriented behavior entity steadily raise inflation expectations. in context, bank’s task consider challenge economies, forward guidance operate different circumstances. it need particularly target price movement strong commitment regard monetary ease policies. iii. general issue forward guidance implementation japan forward guidance popular topic among central bank advance economies; however, practice japan time. indeed, bank pioneer use forward guidance accommodative monetary policy tool face zero low bound, initiate practice early 1999 zero interest rate policy adopt (chart 3). since then, bank come various form forward guidance monetary ease period, i late discuss. moreover, since onset global financial crisis, forward guidance attract global attention mainly result active use federal reserve zero low bound. it also recently implement tool european central bank (ecb) bank england (boe), discuss appendix speech. a. general issue relate forward guidance the term “forward guidance” frequently use number central bank expert appear different mean different contexts. for clarity here, i assume forward guidance simply refer provision information central bank future monetary policy market public, regardless whether central bank call forward guidance. for example, bank officially use term “forward guidance” describe communication strategy, could regard such. essentially, forward guidance aim enhance effectiveness monetary policy. it classify two type depend objective. the first objective clarify normal monetary policy reaction function (or conduct normal monetary policy) envisage central bank. by contrast, second objective commit continuation accommodative policy zero low bind would otherwise anticipate normal policy reaction function. i explain objective shortly, one difference impact financial market – generate downward pressure long-term interest rate (and raise asset prices) – necessarily intentional present case first objective, always deliberately pursue result unconventional monetary policy tool case second objective. while forward guidance attract recent attention role take formulate exit strategy monetary accommodation, case unite states, speech today focus instead role introduce maintain monetary stimulus. forward guidance clarify normal monetary policy stance forward guidance first objective may regard communication strategy central bank inform market public normal policy reaction function monetary policy (such taylor rule). this classify “delphic forward guidance” accord campbell et al. (2012).2 forward guidance instance take form (1) indirect signal future monetary policy stance (for example, 2 jeffrey r. campbell, charles l. evans, jonas d. m. fisher, alejandro justiniano, “macroeconomic effect federal reserve forward guidance,” brook paper economic activity, spring 2012: 1–54. 4 bi central bankers’ speech future policy interest rate path) publish comment projection outlook price economic activity risk balance assessments, take form (2) direct signal release future policy interest rate numerical projections. in case, future policy stance central bank forecast base currently available information normal reaction function. this forecast update new information become available. the important point central bank make commitment future monetary policy. generally, type guidance use enhance transparency predictability market public, necessarily affect financial markets. nonetheless, case guidance may favorably influence financial markets. an example would case forward guidance result clear understand market public central bank’s policy reaction function. they thus adjust expectation accordingly, even central bank’s monetary policy stance constant. there may also case good understand contribute low degree uncertainty, may result in, example, reduce volatility bond market term premiums. finally, may instance market public believe central bank superior information use assess future price economic activity. forward guidance use signal accommodative policy stance the second objective forward guidance signal accommodative policy stance. in instance, use communication strategy central bank zero low bind also deliberate additional monetary ease measure, shift normal policy reaction function. campbell et al. refer type guidance “odyssean forward guidance.” here central bank commit long duration accommodative monetary policy generally anticipate market public. this commitment long accommodative monetary policy need compensate period constrain zero low bound. there gradual accumulation theoretical empirical analysis perspective last decade.3 it extreme form “unconditional commitment” continue current monetary ease policy future. in words, central bank maintain already-promised accommodative stance even economic recovery strengthen whatever shock take place future. the low degree conditionality, effective monetary policy is. however, trade-off great effectiveness high flexibility regard conduct future monetary policy. in practice, realistic central bank make extreme unconditional commitment time-inconsistency issues. it difficult central bank commit current accommodative monetary policy long term without take consideration fact excessive rise inflation may dis-anchor medium- long-term inflation expectations. a similar concern often raise relation impact excessive financial instability asset price bubble policy low interest rate sustain long. therefore, “conditional commitment” use expression reduce degree commitment form generally undertake central banks. 3 see, example, paul r. krugman, “it’s baaack: japan’s slump return liquidity trap,” brook paper economic activity, 1998 (2); 137–205; david reifschneider john c. williams, ‘‘three lesson monetary policy low-inflation era,’’ journal money, credit banking, 32 (4) part 2, 2000: 936–66; gauti b. eggertsson michael woodford, “the zero bind interest rate optimal monetary policy,” brook paper economic activity, 2003 (1); 139–211; michael woodford, “methods policy accommodation interest-rate low bound,” speech deliver 2012 economic policy symposium, federal reserve bank kansa city, 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 5 open-ended, calendar-based, state-contingent forward guidance forward guidance take various forms. for example, apply solely policy interest rate broad set monetary stimulus measure include policy rate asset purchases. it categorize open-ended, calendar-based, state-contingent (or threshold-based).4 open-ended guidance refer abstract description monetary ease policy duration (such “a considerable period” “an extend period”) economic condition accommodative policy maintain (such “until deflationary concern dispelled”). calendar-based guidance us specific date expression monetary easing, “over next six months.” some people consider calendar-based forward guidance superior open-ended forward guidance transparency effectiveness perspective. state-contingent guidance provide clear description economic condition accommodative policy maintain using, example, threshold inflation outlook. when compare calendar-based state-contingent forward guidance, state-contingent approach regard superior two reasons. first, provide assurance central bank’s intention maintain accommodative monetary policy even economic recovery strengthen introduce specific expression guidance. second, clear description relationship conduct future monetary policy economic condition contribute enhance transparency predictability eye market public. the major drawback calendar-based approach difficulty distinguish whether extension period maintain current accommodative monetary policy is, example, (1) result pessimistic forecast central bank price economic activity (2) result accommodative policy. the former may discourage aggregate demand latter may promote aggregate demand. the state-contingent approach may help distinguish two cases. in relation economic condition (or thresholds), forward guidance focus solely price include wide set economic variable (e.g., unemployment rate). the different form reflect (1) presence mandate give central bank, dual mandate case federal reserve; (2) specific environment surround monetary policy time (e.g., whether current inflation trend inflation target); (3) detail measure adopt (e.g., policy interest rate, asset purchases, combination both). the important point i wish highlight degree detail contain description forward guidance vary time. it refine time economic recovery become firm, give specific information duration monetary accommodation economic conditions. b. forward guidance japan let focus forward guidance japan. the bank long history practice communication strategy generate monetary ease zero low bound. there number empirical analysis point effectiveness policy japan, particularly regard impact financial markets.5 forward guidance also constitute important element qqe. i first explain forward guidance use current 4 see, example, bank england, “monetary policy trade-off forward guidance,” 2013. 5 see, example, nobuyuki oda kazuo ueda, “the effect bank japan’s zero interest rate commitment quantitative monetary ease yield curve: a macro-finance approach,” bank japan work paper series, no. 05-e-6, 2005; hiroshi ugai, “effects quantitative ease policy: a survey empirical analyses,” bank japan work paper series, no. 06-e-10, 2006; jouchi nakajima, shigenori shiratsuka, yuki teranishi, “the effect monetary policy commitment: evidence time-varying parameter var analysis,” imes discussion paper series, no. 2010-e-6, bank japan, 2010. 6 bi central bankers’ speech qqe, provide personal view rationale structure, follow comparison past measure countries’ experiences. forward guidance current qqe the bank release statement april 4, 2013, introduction qqe, contain follow two description regard time span monetary accommodation: (1) the bank achieve price stability target 2 percent . . . early possible time, time horizon two year (i call “the first set forward guidance”). (2) the bank continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. it examine upside downside risk economic activity prices, make adjustment appropriate (i call “the second set forward guidance”). you might wonder relationship two description is. in answer this, bank japan governor haruhiko kuroda explain speech april 12, 2013, qqe include necessary measure achieve 2 percent target time horizon approximately two years. he stressed, however, uncertainty economy always degree latitude people’s expectations, appropriate state bank would continue monetary ease long necessary achieve 2 percent target stable manner everyone convince sufficient monetary ease would implemented. thus, two description closely connect reinforce credibility bank’s commitment achieve state target. i would like elaborate personal view, necessarily reflect consensus among bank’s policy board members, focus respective role part release statement forward guidance. in essence, unique structure provide two set forward guidance attributable bank’s challenge task transform deflationary mindset increase inflation expectation anchor around 2 percent level. the first set forward guidance include first part release statement position rationale introduce “a new phase monetary ease term quantity quality” (chart 4). to implement bold new monetary policy, bank decide shift main operate target money market operation uncollateralized overnight call rate monetary base. decision also make double monetary base amount outstanding jgbs exchange-traded fund (etfs) two year end-2014, well double average remain maturity jgb purchase (from le three year seven years). on annual basis, monetary base increase 60–70 trillion yen, jgbs (including maturity 40 years) 50 trillion yen etf 1 trillion yen (chart 5). in addition, japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) purchase annual pace 30 billion yen period.6 the purpose first set forward guidance signal market public bank’s strong determination achieve 2 percent target within time horizon two years, normally pursue central bank inflation target framework. the guidance combine calendar-based (i.e., two years) state-contingent (i.e., 2 percent) features. the calendar-based feature consider essential gain confidence market public bank’s intention possibility 6 in addition, bank continue purchase cp corporate bond amount outstanding reach 2.2 trillion yen 3.2 trillion yen, respectively, end-2013. thereafter maintain amount outstanding. the bank also flexibly purchase treasury discount bill (t-bills) conduct money market operation maximum duration one year. bi central bankers’ speech 7 achieve 2 percent early possible time. an improvement confidence may accelerate pace increase medium- long-term inflation expectation may enhance responsiveness price change supply-demand balance. the second set forward guidance place subheading “the continuation qqe” mid part statement. it conditional commitment, continuation monetary ease subject examination upside downside risk factor (chart 4). it also state-contingent one, link continuation qqe, play great role first set forward guidance stabilize medium- long-term inflation expectation around 2 percent. a relate issue, expression “in stable manner” describe bank’s second set forward guidance may give impression broad description conditions. however, i view expression appropriate present, formation medium- long-term inflation expectation entail uncertainty. in opinion, especially true bank attempt raise inflation expectation subjective judgment policy board member unavoidable whether medium- long-term inflation expectation stabilize around 2 percent, when. additionally, example country central bank raise inflation expectations, bank use reference. some measurement constraint also exist, include fact (1) precise indicator measure inflation expectation household firms; (2) statistical bias include survey data – example, households’ inflation expectation tend upward-biased japan, diffusion index (di) expect sale price tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) tend downward-biased; (3) term market-based indicators, impact bank’s jgb purchase need take account; (4) breakeven inflation rate (bei) indicator also reflect difference liquidity fixed-rate inflation-indexed bonds. nevertheless, price economic activity firmly improve process increase inflation expectation become clearer, i personally feel that, longer-term view points, may opportunity refine second set guidance specific information. these two set forward guidance mutually exclusive, first set guidance consider “necessary condition” achieve second, whereas second set forward guidance show strong commitment continue qqe long necessary stably achieve 2 percent target (chart 4). therefore, time horizon two set guidance overlaps, second set guidance may imply somewhat long time horizon. in addition, second set guidance play essential role reduce volatility long-term interest rates, prevent overshooting. in view, second set guidance warrant necessary action bank beyond two-year horizon, judge necessary light stably achieve 2 percent. it also suggest bank consider exit monetary ease state-contingent guidance achieved. be bank’s forward guidance open-ended? the boe refer bank japan’s second set forward guidance qqe “open-ended” report release august 2013.7 base early arguments, classification consistent assessment, although i fully respect boe’s judgment analysis. when two set forward guidance view together, opinion bank’s forward guidance multi-layered, largely state-contingent, focus 2 percent price stability target strong (conditional) commitment. the boe’s conclusion may draw fact second set forward 7 bank england, “monetary policy trade-off forward guidance.” 8 bi central bankers’ speech guidance refer bank japan’s april 2013 statement subheading “the continuation qqe” expression “in stable manner” may appear qualitative vague. however, describe above, i feel expression “in stable manner” appropriate consider circumstances. c. clear strong commitment compare past practice the forward guidance use bank current qqe reflect clear strong commitment compare previous guidance. in past, bank adopt forward guidance period monetary easing: (1) zero interest rate policy (february 1999–august 2000); (2) quantitative ease policy (march 2001–march 2006); (3) comprehensive monetary ease (october 2010–march 2013), summarize chart 6 7. first round forward guidance: 1999–2000 the first round forward guidance adopt 1999 transmit market public form declaration – rather statement – bank japan governor masaru hayami, press conference april 1999, two month adoption zero interest rate policy. he indicate think bank maintain zero interest rate policy deflationary concern dispelled. this could classify open-ended forward guidance, link continuation zero interest rate policy. however, point expression “deflationary concerns” vague without provide clear definition deflation. a result, allow wide range interpretation judgment exit timing, thereby make difficult policy board member make collective judgment market public adequately convinced. for example, industrial production export improve, rate change (headline core) cpi remain negative. nonetheless, bank terminate policy august 2000 raise uncollateralized overnight call rate average around 0.25 percent, claim downward pressure price stem weak demand markedly receded. a number external commentator express view exit time early. second round forward guidance: 2001–2006 the second round forward guidance adopt quantitative ease policy initiate march 2001, policy rate low average around 0.15 percent previous month. under policy framework, bank shift main operate target money market operation uncollateralized overnight call rate current account balance hold financial institution bank. the target amount balance raise nine time initial 5 trillion yen (which high require reserve level 4 trillion yen) approximately 30–35 trillion yen january 2004. the reserve target achieve mainly relatively short-term money market operation purchase long-term jgbs. the bank decide economic condition warrant drastic monetary easing. it issue statement march 2001 state monetary ease would continue place core cpi register stably zero percent increase year year. this state-contingent guidance, link continuation quantitative ease policy. it note economic condition use guidance base actual performance core cpi thus clear early zero interest rate policy case. in october 2003, bank provide detail information expression “stably zero percent increase” clarify commitment continue quantitative ease policy. it refine expression (1) recently publish core cpi register zero percent above, also tendency confirm months, (2) prospective core cpi expect register zero percent. these condition regard necessary terminate quantitative ease policy, assume might case bi central bankers’ speech 9 quantitative ease would continue even condition fulfilled. this refine state-contingent guidance apply economic condition base actual project price performance. in circumstance, core cpi growth rate turn positive november 2005 (that headline cpi turn positive january 2006). judge condition fulfilled, bank terminate policy march 2006 reintroduce uncollateralized overnight call rate money market operation operate target (initially effectively zero percent). however, cpi figure retroactively revise downward previously positive figure fell negative territory august 2006, cpi base year shift 2000 2005. the scale downward revision great previous case thus large projected. partly downward revision, number external view exit time early. third round forward guidance: 2010–march 2013 the third round forward guidance adopt october 2010, comprehensive monetary ease introduce virtually zero interest rate policy asset purchase program (hereafter program). the type asset purchase program cover jgbs (with remain maturity one three years), treasury discount bill (t-bills), cp, corporate bonds, etfs, j-reits. the total amount outstanding program increase gradually initial 35 trillion yen 65 trillion yen end 2012. the amount schedule expand 101 trillion yen end 2013 111 trillion yen end 2014. thereafter, amount 111 trillion yen maintain undefined period time. the forward guidance statement indicate bank maintain virtually zero interest rate policy price stability sight basis “understanding medium- long-term price stability,” condition serious risk factor identified. in addition, “medium- long-term price stability” define positive range 2 percent lower, midpoint members’ “understanding” around 1 percent. this state-contingent guidance, base outlook price link policy interest rate. it also conditional commitment, risk factor consideration introduce first time additional constraint. importantly, february 2012, guidance strengthen statement for time being, bank pursue powerful monetary ease conduct virtually zero interest rate policy implement asset purchase program . . . aim achieve goal 1 percent. the bank continue pursue powerful ease judge 1 percent goal sight, condition significant risk factor identified. this refine guidance state-contingent, link maintenance policy interest rate asset purchases. it clear powerful original one several reasons. first, use word “goal” (which uniformly set consensus member policy board) rather “understanding” (which simply collection different member views). second, clarify bank set goal 1 percent time being, maintain medium- long-term goal within positive range 2 percent lower. however, drawback clear whether bank purse 2 percent goal low one monetary ease associate 2 percent goal.8. factor lead adoption qqe take drawback account, bank finally adopt 2 percent price stability target january 2013. the statement release indicate bank pursue 8 sayuri shirai, “japan’s monetary policy challenge environment,” speech bank italy eurasia business economics society conference hold rome, bank japan, 2013. 10 bi central bankers’ speech monetary ease aim achieve target early possible time. regard forward guidance, statement indicate bank pursue aggressive monetary easing, aim achieve 2 percent target, virtually zero interest rate policy purchase financial assets, long bank judge appropriate continue policy measure respectively. this remarkable leap history bank’s monetary policy conduct. nonetheless, doubt express whether 2 percent target would achievable within exist monetary policy framework (such exist asset purchase schedule method purchase asset without define end date, schedule introduce january 2014). these doubt eventually lead introduction qqe april year.9 difference qqe past practice in summary, qqe differ past practice follow aspects: (1) great emphasis expectation market public future monetary policy stance (this aggressive measure active use forward guidance adopted); (2) recognition importance medium- long-term inflation expectations; (3) larger-scale purchase longer-term jgbs. overviewing bank’s current past forward guidance practices, say price stability objective relate monetary policy conduct clear qqe past (chart 7). therefore, effectiveness qqe may great past practice – mainly exert great downward pressure entire yield curve, strong impact portfolio rebalance wealth effects, indirect impact yen’s exchange rate. qqe also likely promote increase inflation expectations, thereby contribute low long-term interest rate real terms. d. forward guidance: difference japan advance economy next, i would like make brief comparison forward guidance japan undertake unite state europe, detail include appendix speech. i consider two fundamental difference bank’s current forward guidance adopt advance economies. need anchor inflation expectation inflation target first importantly, major advance economy include unite state unite kingdom successfully anchor medium- long-term inflation expectation around 2 percent, oppose case japan. central bank economy currently hold view expectation remain well-anchored, although may limit concern dis-anchoring inflation expectation (downward case federal reserve decline actual inflation, upward case boe persistent deviation actual inflation 2 percent target). therefore, federal reserve boe focus maintain anchor inflation expectations, whereas bank japan focus increase inflation expectation around 2 percent target anchor there. this difference reflect design forward guidance. labor market issue the second difference japan’s forward guidance practice contrast advance economy federal reserve boe adopt employment-related condition forward guidance, unlike japan. the federal reserve dual mandate promote price stability maximum employment, reason clear. the 9 shirai, “japan’s economic activity, prices, monetary policy.” bi central bankers’ speech 11 boe place price stability primary mandate; however, inclusion employment-related condition may reflect need clarify boe’s view regard exist trade-off high inflation low economic employment growth. in contrast, japan bank’s primary mandate, clearly stipulate bank japan act, achieve price stability. in addition, current unemployment rate significant issue japan. the figure july 2013 low 3.8 percent (3.3 percent female workers), low point recent year 3.6 percent july 2007 (3.4 percent female workers). thus, may relevant japan consider introduce economic condition relate employment. in general, nominal wage rigidity limit japan compare unite state europe, partly explain unemployment rate remain low. the reason firm tend flexibly adjust wage along business cycle active use bonus full-time workers, adjustment work hour day part-time workers. there issue differential treatment regular non-regular workers, great flexibility labor market regulation demand firms. however, structural issue beyond scope monetary policy. iv. price economic performance qqe overviewing framework forward guidance context qqe, may interest progress date japan. i would like quickly review current performance price outlook first, follow performance economic activity. some positive sign observe price there emerge sign actual price begin increase (chart 8). the year-on-year rate change core cpi finally turn positive june 2013 0.4 percent 0.7 percent july, period consecutive negative 0 percent change start may 2012. the headline cpi also turn positive 0.2 percent june 0.7 percent july, follow decline trend since june 2012. this movement reflect high import prices, improvement economic activity, rise inflation expectations. so far, major contribution movement come increase electricity fee gasoline price mainly result increase import price drive yen’s depreciation, well base effect. however, price wide range good service also begin show increase. moreover, consistently-declining trend durable good (partly owe quality adjustment) appear mitigated. this reflect fact large retail store home electronics increasingly shift discount price sale strategy high value-added high unit sale price strategy. some restaurant also attempt raise unit sale price provide high value-added menu services. hotel lodge charge also show increase. regard price indices, domestic corporate good price index already show upward trend positive year-on-year rate change five consecutive months. this pace transfer high import commodity price onto corporate sale price tend much fast cpi. it note firm likely find relatively easy pas increase input cost onto sale price near future, compare past deflationary environment. the corporate service price index also record positive year-on-year rate change three consecutive month positive sign increase price civil engineer architectural services, hotels, lease rental. additionally, land price metropolitan area record turnaround recently, evidence active transaction resultant increase residential commercial land price (chart 9). high land price help improve balance sheet firm financial institution value collateral, thereby contribute active business fix investment 12 bi central bankers’ speech risk-taking behavior. the unit sale price house increase recently, possibly contribute shift deflation-oriented mindset great wealth effects. price outlook inflation expectation a outlook, cpi performance expect improve further; price increase contribution arise back improvement economy high inflation expectation likely greater. conceptually, rate price increase mainly determine supply-demand balance (or output gap) inflation expectations. currently, output gap measure bank tankan composite indicator (the weight average production capacity di employment condition di) remain negative, suggest economy still operate large slack. however, indicator likely improve grind resilient domestic demand expect gradual pick-up overseas demand (chart 10). look medium- long-term inflation expectation market participants, economists, households, see indicator generally rising, still well 2 percent target (chart 11). it note shorter-term inflation expectation tend volatile. they expect exceed 2 percent fiscal 2014 2015, temporary impact schedule consumption tax hike take account. it estimate increase consumption tax 5 8 percent fiscal 2014 would boost inflation 2 percentage point fiscal 2014, increase 8 percent 10 percent october 2015 would boost 0.7 percentage point fiscal 2015. give estimates, appear short-term inflation expectation yet fully incorporate impact schedule tax hike impact (such high import prices, accommodative monetary policy), show chart 12. there short-term indicator available inflation expectation firms; however, di expect sale price next quarter, well compute sale price inflation expectations, show rise trend (chart 13). high inflation expectation help low long-term interest rate real terms. depend measure undertaken, indicator show real interest rate may enter negative territory (chart 14). this create accommodative financial environment. an increase inflation expectation may also contribute promote current consumption house investment. accord bank’s baseline scenario, year-on-year rate change core cpi project reach around 2 percent – price stability target – toward latter half bank’s projection period (fiscal 2013–2015). take median price forecast policy board members, cpi year-on-year rate change (excluding impact tax hikes) expect reach 0.6 percent fiscal 2013, 1.3 percent fiscal 2014, 1.9 percent fiscal 2015 (chart 15). the pace achieve 2 percent depend future movement phillips curve, appear remain largely flat stage (chart 16). the close medium- long-term inflation expectation 2 percent target, large shift curve (chart 2). additionally, fast pace change deflation mindset household deflation-oriented price behavior firms, steep curve become (chart 2). because may take time full impact qqe via process materializes, i consider may degree uncertainty regard duration achieve 2 percent target. gradual rise economic activity outlook the favorable price development discuss early associate positive economic activities. both consumer business confidence indicator show improvement (chart 17). the high level consumer confidence reflect wealth effect drive high stock price compare last year steady improvement employment. this – together front-loaded increase cause expect rise consumption tax hike schedule april 2014 – contribute resilient performance private consumption house investment (chart 18). moreover, improve business confidence, bi central bankers’ speech 13 together increase sale profits, likely expand business fix investment plan firm (chart 19). the outlook economy consistent outlook increase prices. accord bank’s baseline scenario, economy expect continue moderate recovery back resilience domestic demand pick-up overseas economies. while economy likely affect front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior two schedule consumption tax hikes, expect continue grow pace potential growth rate (currently estimate 0.5 percent), virtuous cycle spending, production, income operates. accord median policy board members’ forecasts, real gdp growth rate expect 2.8 percent fiscal 2013, 1.3 percent fiscal 2014, 1.5 percent fiscal 2015, average almost 2 percent (chart 20). v. conclude remark i would like conclude speech today emphasize bank’s task overcome deflation promote change deflation-oriented mindset market public, also anchor inflation expectation around 2 percent. this great challenge face japan’s economy. to end, i believe bank’s communication strategy – view construct two set forward guidance – essential accomplish task. at time, bank utmost revitalize japan’s economy achieve sustainable economic growth. let also add success bank’s monetary policy, qqe, closely associate collective effort entity involved. these include government implement economic growth strategy credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, firm actively engage innovative activity enhance competitiveness, financial institution generate risk money innovative financial service need revitalize japan’s economy.10 i hope speech today useful foster understand bank’s monetary policy. thank much attention. 10 in regard, 2013 article iv consultation report japan release imf august 2013 conclude full implementation structural reform medium-term fiscal consolidation, qqe, may lead realization 2 percent inflation within two year level inflation sustain subsequently. 14 bi central bankers’ speech appendix forward guidance practice unite state europe a. forward guidance unite state the 2003–2004 experience in unite states, federal reserve provide forward guidance 2003–2004, economic recovery weak unemployment remain high. after low target policy interest rate (i.e., federal fund rate) historically low level 1 percent june 2003, federal reserve provide forward guidance way generate monetary accommodation. the statement issue august 2003 indicate [federal open market] committee [fomc] belief policy accommodation maintain considerable period. this open-ended guidance mean signal fomc’s intention keep low policy rate long period might otherwise expected, exert great effect longer-term yields.11 this expression subsequently modify statement issue january 2004, state committee belief patient remove policy accommodation. in may 2004, fomc reverse course intention gradually raise policy interest rate. the interest rate subsequently raise 16 times, 25 basis point each, june 2004 june 2006. forward guidance policy interest rate since global financial crisis since global financial crisis onset, federal reserve re-introduce forward guidance apply separately policy interest rate large-scale asset purchase adopt unconventional measures, low policy interest rate target range low rate 0 0.25 percent december 2008. the descriptive style forward guidance policy interest rate become clear evolve time. the federal reserve initially start statement committee anticipate weak economic condition likely warrant exceptionally low level federal fund rate time. the open-ended guidance replace march 2009 expression “an extend period,” bear nuance somewhat long duration. it develop calendar-based style august 2011 expression “at least mid-2013.” it subsequently adjust “at least late 2014” january 2012. in september 2012, date description modify “at least mid-2015.” in addition, statement include follow description committee expect highly accommodative stance monetary policy remain appropriate considerable time economic recovery strengthens. the key expression “for considerable time economy recovery strengthens” add original description adopt january 2012. the fomc view modify description consistent calendar-based description “at least mid-2015.” moreover, janet yellen, vice chair board governor federal reserve system, point november 2012 date “mid-2015” estimate late liftoff date imply normal policy rule (such modify taylor rule). moreover, date estimate short than, close liftoff date predict optimal policy simulation (a rule minimize deviation inflation 2 percent deviation 11 clemens j. m. kool daniel l. thornton, “how effective be central bank forward guidance?” federal reserve bank st. louis work paper series, 2012–063a, 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 15 unemployment rate 6 percent equal weight objectives).12 this appear prove monetary ease policy consistent second objective forward guidance (or odyssean guidance). the recent style, adopt december 2012, transform calendar-based state-contingent one. the statement indicate committee . . . currently anticipate exceptionally low range federal fund rate [0 0.25 percent] appropriate least long unemployment rate remain 6.5 percent, inflation one two year ahead project half percentage point committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, longer-term inflation expectation continue well anchored. the fomc view threshold consistent previous calendar date description “at least mid-2015.” these threshold regard kind zone combination inflation unemployment rate, project allow ongoing low level policy interest rate. this guidance also imply 2 percent goal average concept – ceiling – medium inflation outlook could temporarily exceed 2 percent, although deviation contain ensure long-term inflation expectation remain well anchored. this clear signal federal reserve permit accommodative policy fulfill mandates. this late guidance apparently influence approach propose charles evans, president federal reserve bank chicago, 2011.13 accord proposal, fomc state low level policy rate would maintain unemployment rate fall substantially 7 percent long medium-term inflation outlook stay 3 percent. narayana kocherlakota, president federal reserve bank minneapolis, meanwhile suggest threshold 5.5 percent unemployment 2.25 percent medium-term inflation outlook. forward guidance asset purchase program regard forward guidance asset purchase program, fomc statement issue december 2008 point plan purchase agency debt mortgage-based security (mbss) use calendar-based guidance expression “over next quarters.” the subsequent statement continue maintain calendar-based guidance (such “this year” “over next six months”) every time federal reserve increase asset purchase include treasury securities. when federal reserve resume purchase agency mb (in september 2012) treasury security (decided december 2012 introduce january 2013), forward guidance shift calendar-based state-contingent one. in statement issue december 2012, economic condition maintain asset purchase describe [substantial] improvement [in labor market] achieve context price stability. b. forward guidance euro area the govern council ecb adopt forward guidance first time july 2013. the introductory statement press conference indicate govern council expect key ecb interest rate remain present low level extend period time. this expectation base overall subdue outlook inflation extend medium term, give broad-based weakness real economy 12 janet l. yellen, “revolution evolution central bank communications,” remark haas school business, university california, berkeley, board governor federal reserve system, 2012. 13 charles l. evans, “the fed’s dual mandate responsibilities: maintain credibility time immense economic challenges,” speech michigan council economic education, federal reserve bank chicago, 2011. 16 bi central bankers’ speech subdue monetary dynamics. this open-ended guidance, link maintenance low policy interest rate (i.e., main refinance operation rate, currently set 0.5 percent). peter praet, member executive board ecb, explain objective adopt guidance reassert ecb’s monetary ease policy.14 he point guidance envisage first (delphic) second (odyssean) objective forward guidance mention earlier. it delphic guidance reveal ecb’s future monetary policy stance base currently-available information. it also odyssean clarify ecb’s commitment medium-term objective (i.e., close 2 percent) determination apply policy measure necessary meet objective. the ecb’s action reflect concern markets’ expect duration regard low interest rate policy shorten may 2013 result change global financial condition (largely cause rise u.s. long-term interest rate due speculation time “tapering” quantitative easing). this shorten occur even though ecb’s assessment price economic activity monetary policy inclination remain constant. the earlier-than-projected hike interest rate imply faster-than-projected monetary tightening, may undermine economic recovery process. in sense, ecb’s action interpret provision monetary accommodation, help lengthen expect duration current interest rate policy financial market line ecb’s view. c. forward guidance unite kingdom in unite kingdom, monetary policy committee (mpc) boe make new move july 2013, although forward guidance describe future monetary policy stance. after express concern significant upward movement market interest rates, statement issue indicate committee’s view, imply rise expect future path bank rate [the policy interest rate] warrant recent development domestic economy. because statement help low market interest rates, effect similar ecb. follow new remit letter george osborne, chancellor exchequer, march 2013, mpc release comprehensive set forward guidance future conduct monetary policy august 2013. the statement indicate mpc intend raise bank rate current level 0.5 percent least . . . unemployment rate fall threshold 7 percent, subject condition below. the mpc stand ready undertake asset purchase unemployment rate remain 7 percent, judge additional monetary stimulus warranted. it also state stock asset purchase would maintain 7 percent threshold reach subject conditions. the condition define form follow three “knockouts”: (1) cpi inflation 18 24 month ahead 2.5 percent; (2) medium-term inflation expectation remain well anchored; (3) financial policy committee (fpc) judge stance monetary policy pose significant threat financial stability cannot contain substantial range mitigate policy action available fpc. if knockout breached, mpc cease above-mentioned guidance. it state-contingent guidance, link policy interest rate, asset purchase sales. the boe explain objective introduce explicit forward guidance provide great clarity mpc’s view exist trade-off inflation unemployment associate monetary policy stance. charlie bean, deputy governor 14 peter praet, “forward guidance ecb,” column publish voxeu.org, centre economic policy research, 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 17 boe, explain august 2013 release guidance clarify mpc’s exist monetary policy stance rather provide additional monetary accommodation.15.by reduce uncertainty, aim low term premium prevent upward movement market interest rates. while mpc show low policy interest rate likely remain throughout three-year forecast period give current unemployment rate outlook, view possibility breach knockout sooner forecast period might add uncertainty regard future accommodative monetary stance. 15 charlie bean,

officer federal reserve bank new york, fordham wall street council, fordham university graduate school business, new york city, 23 september 2013. * * * thank you, dean gautschi, kind introduction. it pleasure today fordham university i thank fordham wall street council host me. this morning remark focus u.s. economic outlook. i also go discus new tool new york feed begin test – overnight, fixed-rate full allotment reverse repo facility. i want dispel misconception testing. the introduction facility precursor change stance monetary policy. instead, goal new facility improve control overnight interest rate aid u implementation monetary policy. a always, i say today reflect view opinion necessarily federal open market committee (fomc) federal reserve system. let start summarize main point regard economic outlook. in view, economy slowly healing. but, significant progress make since end recession, remain number headwind offset improvement underlie fundamentals. a result, yet see meaningful pickup economy’s forward momentum. the notable recent headwind, course, large amount fiscal drag year payroll income tax increase budget sequester. also noteworthy tighten financial market condition occur since may. a move 2014, fiscal headwind abate somewhat. a occurs, improve underlie fundamental economy begin dominate, push overall growth rate. but forecast, realize yet. that one reason i support fomc’s decision last week maintain current pace treasury mortgage-backed security purchases. in view, economy still need support accommodative monetary policy. adjustment policy need anchor assessment economy actually performing, financial condition evolving, affect longer-term outlook risk around it. our decision adjust policy tool – example, pace asset purchase forward guidance respect level short-term rate – must root ongoing flow information inform judgment prospect sustainable recovery. decision pace asset purchase forward guidance must base appropriate achieve dual mandate objective maximum sustainable employment context price stability. economic outlook let’s dig bite deep tug-of-war improve fundamental drag exert fiscal policy tight financial conditions. start improve underlie fundamentals, one important aspect household sector balance sheet. in number dimensions, household make significant progress repair finances. prior recession, household take excessive amount debt – much form residential mortgages. the process deleveraging reduce debt overhang well advanced. for example, household debt relative disposable income decline substantially since peak third quarter 2007, 2 bi central bankers’ speech bring back level last see early 2003. delinquency rate mortgages, auto loan credit card continue decline. in addition, household wealth relative disposable income recover steep decline follow crisis near 20-year average. reflect improvement, credit standard begin ease, support consumer spend durable goods. another sector fundamental improve house sector. most importantly, excess supply house create boom appear largely work off. a result, house price rise area country homebuilding activity strengthened. moreover, scope gain homebuilding. after all, current annualized rate house start – around 900,000 – considerably rate consistent country’s underlie demographic trend expect long-run rate household formation. by metrics, house start ultimately climb back 1.5 million annualized rate. the underlie fundamental support business investment also good. profit margin high cash flow strong time. credit availability gradually improving. for example, federal reserve’s senior loan officer opinion survey indicate bank continue gradually ease lend standard commercial industrial loans. however, improve economic fundamentals, two important offsets. the first offset unusually high degree fiscal drag, congressional budget office (cbo) estimate 1¾ percent potential gdp 2013.1 the two important component restraint end payroll tax holiday increase income tax rate past january, and, recently, government spend cut result budget sequestration. another new source drag economy sharp rise long-term interest rates, especially residential mortgage rate – occur since may. so far don’t much hard data affect house sector. but data mid-september generally indicate rise rate cut upward momentum house sector. currently, improve economic fundamental versus fiscal drag somewhat tight financial condition pull economy opposite directions, roughly cancel other. the economy continue grow payroll rising, little evidence pickup economy’s forward momentum. for example, real gdp growth still stick close 2.2 percent average annualized growth rate prevail since begin expansion. but, degree fiscal drag headwind lessen, tug-of-war begin shift favor high growth. absent additional fiscal restraint, tighten financial conditions, adverse external shock, i expect economy grow bite fast 2014. so, compel narrative? in big picture terms, certainly seem quite reasonable me. however, forecast inevitable reason remain wary. in particular, although fiscal drag likely lessen 2014, i expect still significant, outcome current federal budget debt ceiling debate may affect assessment. moreover, one drill look recent performance outlook economy’s major sectors, additional caution seem warranted. turn first outlook fiscal policy, two point worth making. first, cbo project significant fiscal drag persist 2014. second, fact degree 1 this number refer change high-employment budget deficit fiscal year 2013 estimate cbo march. bi central bankers’ speech 3 restraint lessen next fiscal year could understate actual impact economy full impact year’s cut may yet fully felt. for example, consider university research spend depends, part, federal grants. a grant budget fall sequestration, eventually squeeze university budget time likely lead additional belt-tightening. next, let’s take deep look major sector private economy might play role strengthen story currently: consumption, housing, business investment trade. when we’re done, i think you’ll agree still reason caution. turn first consumer spending, spend remain fairly subdue outside interest rate-sensitive consumer durables. in july, example, real personal consumption expenditure flat, unlikely third quarter consumption growth much 2 percent annual rate. moreover, driver consumer spend look particularly supportive. in particular, real disposable income growth grow le 1 percent annual pace since march. furthermore, recent data yet clearly indicate firm income growth rate, two important component labor income growth – hour compensation. the conundrum consumer simple one: consumer spend growth exceed 2 percent annualized sustain basis time real disposable income growth 2 percent would require household save rate decline persistently. but little reason expect decline give current save rate level consistent current level household wealth relative income. we chicken-egg problem. if save rate remain stable, strong consumption growth require pickup income growth. but income rise, demand must increase. this suggest may need impetus growth sector economy generate boost consumer spend growth. one possible source house sector. a note earlier, house start still quite low relative country’s demographic support long run. but two difficulty here. first, strength house recovery may blunt recent rise mortgage rates. for example, last week’s partial reversal, 30-year fix mortgage rate rise 120 basis point since may 4½ percent. for household consider buy house finance purchase $100,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, rise mortgage rate would increase annual payment $800. the increase finance cost rise home price make house considerably le affordable early year. this illustrate national association realtors’ affordability index decline 25 percent six month end july. second, house activity already contribute significantly growth. for example, past two years, real residential investment swing drag 1.1 percentage point gdp contribution 0.4 percentage points. together, suggest impetus growth house may moderate rather strengthen. perhaps, economy get boost business fix investment. after all, evidence point towards improvement. first, i note earlier, profit margin cash flow high, credit availability improving. thus, business successful track record able readily finance new investments. second, business fix investment high share gdp overall industrial capacity expand slowly. this suggest sector extended. third, drop u.s. energy cost relative rest world spur investment u.s. energy intensive activity petrochemical manufacturing. however, also negative well. in particular, despite positive factor i cited, growth manufacture output moderate, 4 bi central bankers’ speech overall manufacture capacity utilization rate still pre-recession level. thus, outside energy intensive sectors, still appear little near-term motivation firm invest order increase productive capacity. business seem wait strong demand significantly increase investment outlays. thus, second chicken-egg problem. on trade side, news mixed. although japanese european economic activity pick recently, sustainability remain question. even europe emerge recession, growth likely anemic best next year, constrain continue fiscal consolidation tight credit condition bank continue deleverage. in japan, consumption tax schedule increase significantly next year, likely constrain domestic demand. moreover, recent improvement europe japan offset slow emerge market economies. in fact, emerge market economy pressure run large current account trade deficits. any force correction among country trade likely drag global growth u.s. export near term. on balance, outlook growth rest world roughly 2014 year, contribution trade growth likely remain quite small. put factor together, i still conclude basis pickup growth fiscal restraint lessens, impulse likely particularly powerful one without unanticipated impetus growth solve chicken-egg problems, especially near term. on inflation side ledger, inflation remain federal reserve’s 2 percent longer-run objective personal consumption expenditure (pce) deflator. the year-over-year change total pce deflator 1.4 percent july. this create concern inflation “too low,” raise real interest rate make monetary policy le accommodative. i acknowledge concern, i believe abate inflation move gradually back towards 2 percent annualized rate next years. a number consideration inform view. first, decomposition core inflation reveal recent slow inflation largely confine core goods, whereas rate increase core service relatively steady. such case 2010 – previous instance significant slow inflation. this suggest fall inflation partly reflect idiosyncratic factor likely sustained. second, recent data suggest downtrend inflation rate may come end. for example, core personal consumption expenditure deflator rise high rate past three month 3-month period since mid-2012. third, measure longer-term inflation expectations, whether discern financial asset price survey household professional forecasters, remain well anchor level consistent 2 percent objective. this important inflation expectation major determinant inflation process. a long inflation expectation stay well-anchored, hard inflation fall further. put factor together along forecast gradual pickup real economic activity, outlook inflation drift back toward 2 percent objective medium term. however, much like case real growth outlook, significant uncertainty around forecast. monetary policy so imply monetary policy? a aware, last week’s fomc meet make change monetary policy. in particular, committee decide continue purchase long-term treasury security agency mortgage-backed security bi central bankers’ speech 5 monthly pace $45 billion $40 billion, respectively. the fomc statement reaffirm committee’s intention “to continue purchase treasury agency mortgage-backed securities, employ policy tool appropriate, outlook labor market improve substantially context price stability.”2 we also reaffirm forward guidance respect federal fund rate. the statement note committee, “currently anticipate exceptionally low range federal fund rate appropriate least long unemployment rate remain 6-1/2 percent, inflation one two year ahead project half percentage point committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, longer-term inflation expectation continue well anchored.”3 several question emerge follow meeting. most noteworthy – give market expectation skew towards anticipate begin taper meet – committee begin reduce pace asset purchases. although i can’t speak committee, i provide reason decision. to begin taper, i two test must passed: (1) evidence labor market show improvement, (2) information economy’s forward momentum make confident labor market improvement continue future. so far, i think make progress respect metrics, yet achieve success. with respect first metric, see labor market improvement since program begin last september. over time period, unemployment rate decline 7.3 percent 8.1 percent.4 however, time, decline unemployment rate overstate degree improvement. other metric labor market conditions, hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate, quit rate vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate much modest improvement labor market condition compare suggest decline unemployment rate. in particular, still hard unemployed find jobs. currently, three unemployed worker per job opening, oppose average two period 2003 2007. with respect second metric – confidence economic recovery strong enough generate sustain labor market improvement – i don’t think yet pass test. the economy pick forward momentum 2 percent growth rate – even sustain – might sufficient generate improvement labor market conditions. moreover, fiscal uncertainty loom large right congress consider issue fund government raise debt limit ceiling. assume change assessment efficacy cost associate purchase program, i’d like see economic news make confident see continue improvement labor market. then i would feel comfortable time come cut pace asset purchases. a point respect monetary policy worth emphasize follow last week’s fomc meeting. first, i note early remarks, decision reduce rate asset purchase tighten monetary policy. if purchase additional security simply add accommodation slow pace. second, decision cut pace asset purchase take signal early exit period unusually low short-term rates. we establish threshold 6.5 percent unemployment rate long expect inflation exceed 2 federal open market committee statement, september 18, 2013. 3 federal open market committee statement, september 18, 2013. 4 the 8.1 percent unemployment rate refer august 2012 unemployment rate late information available committee september 2012 meeting. 6 bi central bankers’ speech 2½ percent one-to-two year horizon inflation expectation remain well-anchored. it likely take considerable amount time reach 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold. moreover, 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold, trigger, depend economic circumstances, might wait long time breach threshold begin raise federal fund rate target. the point i wish emphasize decision pace asset purchase (the rate add accommodation) versus liftoff term federal fund rate (a tighten monetary policy) view largely independent one another. one foreshadow – certainly mechanical way definitive timeframe. a chairman bernanke note last week’s press conference, action data dependent data evolve uncertain. in addition, worth explain anticipate federal fund rate still likely quite low relative committee participant consider normal long run, even committee get close employment inflation objectives. for example, september summary economic projections, median projection federal fund rate fourth quarter 2016 2 percent, far median long-run federal fund rate projection 4 percent, time unemployment rate inflation close committee’s long-run objectives. how one explain this? a note chairman bernanke last week’s press conference, still low federal fund rate projection 2016 reflect fact economic headwind – tight credit standard ongoing fiscal consolidation – likely take long time fully abate. a result, monetary policy keep short-term interest rate low sustain period order committee achieve objectives. my view neutral federal fund rate consistent trend growth currently low. that’s one reason economy grow fast despite current accommodative stance monetary policy. although neutral rate gradually normalize long-run economic fundamental continue improve headwind abate, process likely take many years. in meantime, federal fund rate level consistent committee’s objective maximum sustainable employment context price stability likely well long-run level. fixed-rate, full allotment overnight reverse repo facility before i conclude, i want discus new tool open market trade desk (the desk) new york feed test develop come months. the new tool fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight reverse repo facility would available broad range counterparties – open primary dealer historically conduct open market operations.5 by available much broad array counterparties, allow feed tighten control money market rates. i’ll first explain plain english facility is. then i’ll explain test facility place might accomplish. a fixed-rate, full allotment overnight reverse repo facility facility federal reserve post fix interest rate accept cash counterparties, include banks, dealers, money market funds, government sponsor enterprise (gses), 5 the desk conduct operational readiness exercise use reverse repurchase agreement since late 2009. at recent fomc meet last week, fomc authorize desk begin another test program begin today. see desk’s september 20 announcement next round testing. bi central bankers’ speech 7 overnight basis return security. if implemented, facility would “full allotment” – mean facility would cap amount fund accept counterparties post overnight interest rate.6 the repo facility “reverse” direction fund security move – participant lend fund feed rather vice versa. user facility make economic equivalent overnight collateralize loan cash federal reserve. the amount fund invest facility likely sensitive post interest rate. the high interest rate relative comparable money market rates, great participation likely vice versa. there several reason motivate interest develop facility. first, facility enable federal reserve improve control level money market rates. by offer new, essentially risk-free investment, one would expect anyone access facility would generally unwilling lend instead someone else rate post facility. this help establish floor level overnight rates. right now, short-term rate trade 0 25 basis points, occasionally t-bill repo rate go negative, example quarter-end financial stress increase demand safe assets. the full allotment element reverse repo facility would increase availability risk-free asset, satisfy demand appetite safe asset increases. this help tighten relationship money market rates. these reverse repos would available expand set counterparties include many money market lender ineligible earn interest excess reserve (ioer), g number money market funds. depend facility rate, lender cannot earn ioer rate might get good rate invest overnight rrps compare lend bank broke dealers. this competitive effect could, itself, put strong floor money market rates. second, new facility also likely reduce volatility short-term interest rates. if lender cannot earn ioer rate unexpectedly large amount fund invest, lender currently may accept unusually low interest rate. but overnight reverse repo facility place, lender could lend much fund desire facility fix rate reduce downward pressure money market rates. by tighten control reduce volatility short-term rates, facility reassure investor federal reserve sufficient tool manage monetary policy effectively even large balance sheet. i tell facility for. now let emphasize test development facility foreshadow. the test development facility undertake facilitate expedite exit large balance sheet consider element exit process. the purpose facility establish floor money market rate improve implementation monetary policy even balance sheet large. even balance sheet increase significantly stay large many years, useful facility available improve monetary policy control. in come month test facility two goal mind. first, want assure glitch operationally somewhat high transaction volume previous tests, accept cash large array counterparties, post collateral tri-party repo system reverse transaction day smoothly. second, limit size operation exercise prevent operation significant impact market rates, observe facility impact individual 6 during test phase, ceiling place maximum amount invest per counterparty. 8 bi central bankers’ speech investor demand relative market rates. additionally, see sensitive demand change market condition quarter-end increase demand safe assets. these observation give u insight facility could affect entire constellation money market rates. only test learn able ass best use facility. in conclusion, let turn back economic outlook role monetary policy. i believe make progress towards objective maximum sustainable employment context price stability. the economic fundamental improve i expect heal process continue come month years. at time, important recognize financial crisis generate significant headwind slowly abating. we must push headwind forcefully best achieve objectives.

different viewpoints. for government interest fulfil social mandate facilitate access decent house low- middle- income families, problem find necessary resource carry public house programs. let set aside dwell minute experience mauritius government set early 1963 organism gear towards provision social housing. this organism evolve mauritius house corporation (mhc), today finance institution –

financial system. today, i like take opportunity share viewpoint central bank think role encourage investment house take account risk investment may pose financial stability. hopefully, i able contribute towards deep awareness understand risk issue link house financing. at least two factor make highly topical subject. first, 2008 global financial crisis shed spotlight directly house market, prompt many question raise practice house finance. these question challenge traditional assumption lend house purpose generally safe low-risk activity, highlight potential danger central bank bank need concern about. secondly, current accommodative stance monetary policy couple increase competition 2 bi central bankers’ speech house market call great vigilance bank monitor risk link house loans. in mauritius, credit house purpose always constitute large share total credit households. currently, advance grant bank house purpose account around 62 per cent total household credit. a percentage gdp, house loan increase 7.1 per cent end-march 2008 12.1 per cent first quarter 2013. late data show investment residential build post robust growth rate 26.9 per cent first quarter 2013,

increase evidence rise investment property also important. house loan remain relatively sound. however, house finance profitable business banks, competition intensify considerably. today bank compete aggressively borrower offer highly competitive home loan package meet different need borrowers. bank need aware risk pose rapidly expand house credit portfolio. the financial crisis 2008 consequence world economy serve useful reminder need. part central bank mandate ascertain that, notwithstanding competition need make profits, bank maintain prudent approach grant house loans. at time, regulatory framework set bank mauritius encourage investment housing, particularly regard first-time buyers. in line international standard prescribe basel committee bank supervision, credit extend residential purpose classify preferential bucket 35 per cent risk-weighted asset computation capital adequacy ratio requirement. accordingly, bank implicitly encourage increase quantum portfolio house credit give maintain low regulatory capital hold asset books. in 2004, commission inquiry set government sale levy system light several case foreclosure rise number lawsuit file court borrower whose loan become non-performing. subsequently, promulgation borrower protection act 2007 come rescue clearly set obligation lender provide clear information term condition govern grant credit facility, include finance acquisition immovable property. several measure take bank mauritius: bank request abide provision say act loans, specifically respect facility amount rs2 million; view close monitor case lodge court borrowers, bank request provide information case sale levy periodical basis bank mauritius. presently, bank mauritius work several initiative aim promote investment first-home buyers. macroprudential measure shall shortly become applicable credit extend bank sector residential purposes, policy measure shall include guideline towards demarcate credit grant house purpose property investment base speculation commercial purposes. there doubt make clear distinction term condition applicable first-house buyer would facilitate grant loans. it also perceive buy first house represent low-risk investment collateral mortgage finance usually secure fix charge land building. however, bank mauritius adopt stance bank maintain sound bi central bankers’ speech 3 lend standard grant credit facility house sector. while due regard level household indebtedness macro level, bank mauritius underline need financial institution undertake proper assessment borrowers’ repayment capacity. this would prevent household become overleveraged. the bank mauritius ensure accurate information convey advertisement issue financial institution attract borrowers. in regard, “teaser rates” home loan conspicuously displayed, bank mauritius require information, include annual percentage rate (apr), display well potential borrower clearly make aware imply interest rate applicable annual basis. conclusion house finance contribute significantly raise live standard people, either africa part world. view macro level, house finance generate economic growth via job creation, entrepreneurship, economic linkage sectors. however, one cannot ignore fact recent financial crisis rock global economy closely relate crash subprime mortgage lend unite states, so-called cd credit default swap. while take lesson global financial turmoil, bank mauritius remain commit goal maintain soundness stability financial system mauritius. stakeholder therefore aim way improve access house finance sustainable

papua new guinea, port moresby, 9 september 2013. * * * acknowledgment the organizer entitle presentation “economic briefing” ask touch upon “sovereign wealth fund”. i best time allot me, cover subject more. i commence subject inflation: a might know, bank papua new guinea’s (the bank) main role objective, case many develop country central banks, “price stability”. only objective achieved, subject “to promote macro-economic stability economic growth papua new guinea”. in last four year 2009–2012, bank papua new guinea achieve primary secondary objectives, far beyond expectations. inflation average 6.4% per annum. give high economic growth, measure real increase gross domestic product (gdp) 9.5% period, inflation outcome low end projection expectations. the outcome still try fully understand low inflation 2012, 2.2%. this trend continue 2013 inflation 1.6% march quarter 0% june quarter, spite devaluation kina since last quarter 2012. in past, analysis show devaluation one main cause inflation. it may seem effect kina devaluation offset low import inflation low inflation major trade partner country slow capital inflow, could measurement issue. at present bank’s projection show inflation 2013 around 5.5%. the bank’s assessment analysis show projection high side. i state confidence that, “price stability”, achieved. the second subject presentation gdp growth: a state above, gdp growth last four year 9.5%. present projection 5.2% growth 2013. this projection which, view low side, mean five year 2009 2013 average gdp growth 9%. there question one high growth

development. such insight fee importantly central bank’s understand work trinidad tobago economy, thus policy deliberation bank. i strongly believe that, especially unusual times, kind dialogue private sector critical. i probably need tell anyone room indeed live unusual times. policymakers around world grapple past six year economic crisis, repeatedly mutated, still clear direction crisis go take next. from origin sub-prime crisis unite state morph sovereign debt crisis europe, current manifestation fiscal/political gridlock across side atlantic, various measure take address mutation crisis lead unintended consequences. just three month ago, imf manage director talk three-speed global economy emerge market develop country generally well, advance economy like unite state mend. others japan euro area still distance travel. during last weeks, sentiment change dramatically global financial markets, unintended consequences. market overreact earlier-than-expected start reduction monetary stimulus unite states, even though federal reserve clearly state commence, would do slowly would highly conditional. the surprise intensity market reaction potential end quantitative ease contribute sudden reversal capital flow many emerge market economies, send currency tumble stock market decline. such volatility may well signal start new mutation ongoing global financial crisis. it may well forerunner new risk could materialize unconventional u.s. monetary policy begin unwind earnest. at time, important note many “old” tail risk (low probability, high-impact events) global economy – breakup euro zone, unite state go fiscal cliff, hard land china – still remain unresolved. the domestic economy lady gentlemen, trinidad tobago economy weather turbulence global financial crisis fairly well, yet experience sustain recovery downturn start late 2008. let give brief summary current economic position. 2 bi central bankers’ speech economic growth considerably

production adversely affect refine activity output petrochemicals. crude oil production continue secular decline account age oil field low condensate output. on hand, non-energy sector continue slow steady pace revival, could fully offset contraction energy output. accordingly, estimate central bank’s quarterly real gdp index indicate domestic economy grow mere 0.2 per cent 2012. so far 2013, encourage sign gradual recovery. our preliminary estimate indicate trinidad tobago economy grow 1.7 per cent (year-on-year) first three month 2013. this third consecutive quarter overall economic

growth still lacklustre. accord late labor market data central statistical office, unemployment rate fell 4.9 per cent second quarter 2012 5.8 per cent second quarter 2011. more recent data

programme spur economic growth, reach $3.4 billion slightly level record october 2011 may 2012. unless government significantly pick pace capital spending, overall budgetary stance could prove mildly expansionary end fiscal year, three month away. provisional data ministry finance economy show gross public sector debt remain within manageable levels. at end march 2013, public debt (excluding security issue treasury bill open market operations) increase 45 per cent gdp, still well within 50 per cent limit consider prudent debt burden. the increase public debt result mainly issuance bond compensate former policyholder clico. i wish point policyholder convert bond bi central bankers’ speech 3 equity hold clico investment fund, government retire part public debt, low overall public debt stock. after reach double digit around middle 2012, headline inflation moderate latter part year, ease around 5½ per cent may 2013. the slowdown inflation largely associate steady fall food price inflation, especially soften global grain cereal price ease inflationary impetus abroad. the removal value add tax (vat) select non-luxury food item mid-november 2012 one-off impact reduce food price inflation. core inflation, exclude food prices, remain low stable, indicative relatively subdue demand pressures. buoyant liquidity conditions, poor credit appetite cut repo rate push interest rate historical lows. however, yet see broad pick business lending. credit grant consolidate financial system private sector grow slowly throughout 2012 fairly gradual clip 2–3 per cent first four month

private valuators, estimate median price typical 3-bedoom today 10 per cent low peak median house price early 2012. more importantly, commercial bank maintain mortgage lend standards, still conservative loan-to-value loan service-to-income ratios. give gradual pace economic recovery stability core inflation, central bank maintain accommodative monetary stance. to provide need boost economic activity, bank cut key policy rate, repo rate, 25 basis point record low 2¾ per cent september 2012, follow 75 basis point previous cut since december 2010. lethargic credit demand high net fiscal injection lead considerable build excess liquidity financial system. commercial banks’ excess reserve hold central bank rise daily average around $5½ billion first half 2013, daily average nearly $4 billion first half 2012. the bank continue absorb excess liquidity open market operation request commercial bank roll mature hold interest-bearing special deposit hold bank. sale foreign exchange bank also indirectly remove excess liquidity bank system. we also facilitate issue $1 billion, seven-year treasury bond may 2013 support liquidity absorption efforts. these treasury bond

intervene consistently foreign exchange market. nonetheless, country’s gross official reserve remain strong us$9.4 billion end june 2013, 10 month import cover. economic outlook lady gentlemen, recent up-turn domestic economic activity, particularly non-energy sector, indicate economic sentiment gradually improve become widespread. 4 bi central bankers’ speech perhaps fundamental downside risk country’s improve economic outlook relate action two large natural gas producer (bptt bgtt), expect continue major maintenance operation significant shutdown schedule around september 2013. this high probability, high impact event. failure part ministry energy energy affair two energy company reach agreement minimize sharp supply disruption energy output would throw track economy’s current growth mode, result close zero growth even contraction year whole. for part, central bank advance financial program regulatory reform design ensure crisis scale clico never happen again. i adamant marauder gate never breach regulatory wall fortress great cost citizen economy. we place top priority successful passage insurance bill 2013, recently refer joint select committee parliament. the bill introduce best practice area corporate governance, risk management, consolidate supervision consumer protection insurance industry. among measure bring bill strengthen power inspector financial institution central bank, legally empower oversee operation insurance industry also intervene sector become necessary. while challenge remain, final resolution clico’s failure seem horizon. such development positively impact economic confidence. with firmly anchor inflation expectations, central bank give weight accommodative monetary stance firm economic turnaround established. however, outlook inflation, growth, financial stability change, take appropriate action. we pay close attention particular possibility normalization monetary policy unite states, consequent impact emerge market economies, especially trinidad tobago. boost business confidence lady gentlemen, let turn issue i would like highlight context morning’s discussion competitiveness sustainable development. many expect central bank one bring back growth. and indeed, past years, global financial crisis place immense demand monetary policy around world. in andrew crockett memorial lecture hold bank international settlement week ago, professor raghuram rajan university chicago’s booth school business describe situation quite well: “when central banker offer game town, environment politician choice bad worse, become game town.” but game town. i wish remind that, monetary policy, central bank influence aggregate demand economy. but monetary policy cannot solve deep structural problem lift growth potential economy. that require bring balance fiscal policy speed implementation structural policy eliminate supply-side constraint private investment non-energy sector. bi central bankers’ speech 5 from frequent conversation business leaders, know one important structural issue face trinidad tobago economy moment need boost business confidence. trinidad tobago look return self-sustaining, self-generating growth. to realize economic growth need see rebuild capacity, expansion exist company creation new ones. this call strong confidence among exist business entrepreneurs. we already see welcome sign confidence. at one end business spectrum, small firm mushroom various cluster around country include charlieville, felicity, tunapuna, sangre grande, rio claro, penal/debe. some small firm retail distribution. others construction energy services. at end business spectrum, conglomerate publicly announce major investment projects. these include: 1. a $500 million joint venture multicinemas trinidad limit jt allum group company develop „c3‟ movie shop complex corinth, south trinidad. 2. ansa mcal’s $400 million state art clay plant, expect single large investment construction year. 3. a us$600 million joint venture among neal massy, russian firm severstal international metaldom dominican republic build vertically integrate iron steel complex union estate, la brea. 4. neal massy’s project development agreement mitsubishi corporation, mitsubishi gas chemical company government trinidad tobago construct operate plant produce methanol dimethyl-ether (dme) union estate, la brea. the project expect cost roughly us$850 million. i commend business leader vote confidence country’s economic prospects, enough. we need entire business community stop watch comment game sidelines. lady gentlemen, view business must stop feed government. and business must start feed government. i remind damn word ralph maraj december 31, 2012 column trinidad express entitle “the private sector can’t dance” business community: “for past years, business elite sit resources, mark time still accumulating; venture take measure risk stimulate economy; waiting, always, treasury provide new feeding. and continue absurdly shout government ‘diversify, diversify’, responsibility critical national need.” peter o’ connor sunday june 30 newsday column entitle “lacking leadership” echo similar concerns. “which businessman here, bank system drown liquidity, vision capability diversify economy instead beg government ‘corporate urp’”? since central bank game town, i take opportunity remind entire business community responsibility urge back onto field. my appeal take long term perspective invest people technology raise growth level make growth inclusive. play game passionately, intensely fearlessly! 6 bi central bankers’ speech conclusion in conclusion, i wish reiterate trinidad tobago navigate well choppy water global financial crisis, continue so. but message seem absorb nation. instead, one country lurch one crisis another. we seem penchant self-inflicted wounds, look country glass half empty perspective. i appeal u look economy glass half full point view. this actually difficult do. growth consolidating, unemployment low, public debt manageable citizen still enjoy high standard living. the central bank absolutely commit maintain macroeconomic stability firm make longer-term decision environment confidence. by explain cross-currents work economy, projection what’s ahead, monetary policy response, part help mend business confidence. we open meet business group good understand need support required. i convince high calibre business leader smart, professional innovative. and totally commit country. you must change want see trinidad tobago. i thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: a regime change supervision resolution keynote speech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, european supervisor education (ese) conference, frankfurt main, 26 september 2013. * * * lady gentlemen, thank invite speak today. a know, europe recent year face bad economic financial crisis since 1930s. growth remain weak unemployment unacceptably high, first shoot recovery show through. yet difficulties, positive begin emerge. the euro area recognise that, collective stability, deepen integration certain area – begin so. what see play today much “audacity hope”, rather “audacity necessity”. in view, significant change take place development bank union. monetary union need bank union, least stable bank sector essential complement sound money. i therefore see project build bank union important integration step since launch euro. for u involve supervision financial sector issues, especially fascinate time. we political scientist call “critical juncture” – rare time window opportunity open fundamentally redesign institutions. it feel like back 25 year ago prepare emu. but also impose u responsibility. this window may open many years, need make sure decision take today right ones. most importantly, need ensure bank union label – initiate genuine regime change way bank supervise resolved. how achieve regime change i would like focus remark today. the element regime change in view, genuine regime change involve two elements: first, build single system bank supervision resolution; and, place, build strict system well. why need elements? we need single system ensure level play field bank sector across europe – hence create truly single financial market europe. 20 year single market suppose completed, bank sector europe remain fragment along national lines. this many drawbacks, least disrupt monetary policy transmission, make bank expose country-specific shocks, encourage home bias government bond purchase strengthen bank-sovereign loop. to give example far short remain fully integrate financial market, recent study find that, 2005 2012, average number bank merger acquisition per year unite state 343, whereas europe yearly average 58. one reason lack single system supervision resolution across europe, discourage cross-border activity. 2 bi central bankers’ speech we need strict system ensure that, new tool bank union, use proactively – namely, create strong stable bank sector. we still uphill struggle europe restore investor confidence bank sector. and partly consistently strict approach bank – balance sheet transparency, loss recognition resolution. evidence divergence price-to-book ratio large complex bank euro area outside. for bank outside currently around 1, euro area bank 0.7 – words, euro area bank price market le book value. an important reason country outside euro area make much fast progress acknowledge loss resolve bank viable. create genuine regime change, system supervision resolution application, could therefore powerful effect europe. in near term, could help accelerate clean-up banks’ balance sheet thus restart bank lending. in medium term, could help encourage development genuinely european banks. so get regime change? build single system let start first element, build single system. in view, system single, two condition fulfilled. first, need single set rules. second, rule contain discretion, need central authority enforce evenly. a single system supervision for supervision, currently make progress conditions. in term rules, new rulebook bank across europe part capital requirement directive iv. within single supervisory mechanism (ssm), also single supervisory manual apply banks. this cover issue like methodology supervisory review evaluation process (srep), off-site on-site reviews, risk assessment model validations. we thereby ensure supervisory standard apply across bank union – indeed, harmonisation european bank authority, across eu whole. in term decision-making, strengthen centre integrate european national level supervision. a particular innovation joint supervisory teams, contain staff ecb national competent authorities. there one team significant bank group directly supervise ssm, operate management coordinator work ecb. this guarantee collective approach ensure always european element decision-making. indeed, final responsibility decision rest ecb. this process create integrate ssm course major organisational challenge. we bring together 17 different national supervisors, different operate culture supervisory philosophies, single mechanism single culture philosophy. and ecb directly hire around 1,000 new staff, around 750 involve supervision. so take time reach cruise speed. with ssm regulation foresee enter force begin november, ready publish vacancy notice chair supervisory board, follow top management ssm – four director general main department six deputy director general. the vacancy notice middle management follow week later, – accordance cascade principle – broad bi central bankers’ speech 3 recruitment begin. we need ready basic structure organisation asset quality review (aqr) towards end first quarter 2014. let therefore briefly take opportunity describe foresee ssm’s organisational structure. the ssm contain four directorate general secretariat division. two directorate general (dgs micro-prudential supervision i ii) conduct direct day-to-day supervision significant banks. the division responsibility supervision two department largely determine accord risk-based approach, allow specialise risk exposure, complexity business model credit institutions. the third directorate general (dg micro-prudential supervision iii) host conduct indirect supervision le significant bank groups. direct supervision bank still carry relevant national competent authority (nca) day-to-day basis, regular report ecb. the fourth directorate general (dg micro-prudential supervision iv) perform horizontal supervision specialise expertise functions, supervisory quality assurance, methodology standard development, enforcement sanctions, crisis management, capital market risk analysis model validation. within organisational set-up, middle management director general encompass head division section senior advisors, joint supervisory team (jst) coordinator chosen. let also say word foresee practical work organisation off- on-site-supervision. the joint supervisory team (jst) responsible day-to-day supervision significant banks. they propose inspections, participate without lead inspections. that task allocate head mission. the head mission nominate horizontal directorate general, micro-prudential supervision iv – is, ecb. generally, on-site inspection team lead nca staff. this preclude, however, possibility ecb take lead. the jsts prepare recommendations, lead close meet inspection credit institution, provide follow-up recommendations. the horizontal dg charge maintain on-site inspection methodology. moreover, plan on-site inspection conduct significant bank yearly basis update half yearly basis global inspection planning. on-site inspection specific in-depth investigation risks, risk control governance. they carry basis predefined scope, timeline resources, use investigate inspect technique test control substantive procedures, follow common standards. they follow specific procedure conduct independent manner – vis-à-vis jst, ncas respective inspect credit institutions. the outcome on-site inspection report contain find executive summary. a single system resolution a single system resolution important single system supervision. bank need know treat life death – creditor invest them. so again, single set rule central authority enforce essential. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the single set rule resolution – bank recovery resolution directive – already agree council european union, discussion way european parliament. in principle, i welcome directive vast improvement status quo. before crisis country resolution framework place, lead ad hoc inconsistent approach different countries. however, i think directive fall short discretion still allow national resolution authority exempt certain class liability bail-in. in view, conducive build single system, leaf much uncertainty bail-in applied. one imagine situation, example, particular class investor exclude bail-in owe national political economy concerns. or situation large country large resolution fund position exclude creditor small countries. investor force second-guess issues. in context, authority take central decision become even important. if go discretion resolution rule applied, need ensure discretion apply way across different countries. this underscore strong single resolution mechanism necessary – and, concretely, mechanism independent decision-making power national vetoes. a single resolution mechanism also essential ensure single approach resolution cross-border banks. divide resolution along national line prove efficient way solve cross-border coordination problem achieve least-cost resolution strategy overall. moreover, divide system anticipate protract wrangle burden-sharing, delay clean-up crisis. to address issue, i see essential mechanism comprise single resolution authority, also single resolution fund. the commission’s proposal single resolution mechanism foresee fund, finance levy private banks. accord commission estimates, reach size €55 billion 2025. i welcome proposal principle. but i think that, build-up phase, clarification need happen exceptional circumstance lead fund’s resource exhausted. the proposal unclear here. in view credible backstop essential ensure resolution cost separate national budgets. to sum up, define single system single set rule enforce evenly centre. we way achieve supervision. i see essential also achieve resolution. bank union ultimately way establish single financial market bank separate sovereigns. to paraphrase mervyn king, therefore need ensure bank european life european death. build strict system let turn second element genuine regime change, build strict system. put place new rule institution supervise resolve bank essential. but equally important use way lead measurably strong stable bank sector. how achieve this? bi central bankers’ speech 5 a new approach supervision the first build block willingness part policy-makers make bank balance sheet transparent accord common standard ssm. the ssm regulation put u position require comprehensive assessment bank ecb directly supervise. this requirement go beyond purely account exercise. we ensure assessment rigorous manage centre. there point new pair glass will open eyes. our current plan comprehensive assessment three elements. first, risk assessment, identify broad risk factors, include fund liquidity risks. second, balance sheet assessment, review asset quality use calculation, qualification valuation check broad risk-based nature, central quality assurance accord common methodology. this draw expertise external consultants. third, stress test, apply result adverse scenario. the linkage balance sheet assessment stress test still need define detail. what clear, however, communicate vessels. if former thorough point-in-time stock-taking, late contain forward look elements. a consequence three-pronged exercise, bank might face capital gap close. in view, important credibility exercise scope process remain ambitious; implies, example, data integrity validation undertaken. of course, need alert practical concern stakeholder exercise, include banks. it important requirement bank clearly defined, finalised, explain deliver well ahead official start date. ideally, final templates, include accompany instruction use them, long alter data compile balance sheet assessment. but compromise scope strictness exercise. we would like launch exercise, start determination risk portfolios, end year already – although depend extent full supervisory board appointed. i confident that, ssm regulation approved, ecb european parliament work constructive spirit appoint supervisory board – particular ensure fast-track procedure appointment chair. when result assessment, policy-makers also need will deal consequences. certainly, european bank strong position today year ago. for example, spain bank provision €184 billion euro – 10.5% loan book – raise €22 billion new equity since 2008. but cannot rule possibility exercise still reveal capital needs. it essential backstop place address this. if backstop there, i fear exercise create lose-lose situation bank sector. if result reveal small capital needs, market think fudge save public money. if reveal significant capital needs, market question filled, create uncertainty. either way confidence boost hope gain assessment lost. a new approach resolution the second build block strict system involve change way deal non-viable banks. to begin with, need make sure use new resolution power full extent. a european country much experience wind banks, 6 bi central bankers’ speech may tendency avoid put bank resolution – practise supervisory forbearance allow bank ever time restore viability. the ecb supervisor important role play ensure happen. to ensure resolution power use full, would also help element new resolution framework place time. the supervisory power ssm apply principle november 2014 onwards. the bank recovery resolution directive framework foresee take effect january 2015, start single resolution mechanism plan date. but current agreement, new provision bail-in would applicable january 2018. this mean period three year resolution authority unable use one key resolution tools. for reason, i favour bring forward entry force bail-in. the directive still agree european parliament, view push start date 2015 bail-in full resolution toolbox available outset – instead over-extending state aid rule proxy. conclusion let conclude. what i try illustrate today regime change involve two components. first, right rule institution ensure single system. second, willingness use rule institution strict manner. it therefore question mechanisms, also mindsets. we already make encourage progress, particular ssm. but still long way go, success possible cooperative effort. whether bank union achieve regime change ultimately depend cooperation dedication literally thousand legislators, regulator supervisors. it definition “team effort”. in vein, need strengthen joint train effort supervision skills. the european supervisor education initiative example common cross-border approach could build upon. yet view bank union challenge times. the crisis present u once-in-a-generation opportunity: build safe bank sector; strengthen monetary union; process take forward historical process european integration. we privilege opportunity – need take it. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: deutsche bank prize attribution raghuram rajan

great pleasure participate panel occasion award prestigious deutsche bank prize – and, particular, associate event honour work raghuram rajan. i become great admirer raghuram’s work, even wholly uncritical one, premonitory paper1 present jackson hole central bank conference 2005. it paper i distribute widely friend colleague time. but, course, raghuram’s previous work also quite well know – particularly research theory banking, bank capital liquidity risk, liquidity creation bank unavoidable financial fragility implies2. that research, conduct often douglas diamond, fit well panel theme today. liquidity somewhat elusive concept ever since keynes define treatise money 1930 hick develop subsequent work3. liquidity relative concept, matter degree, start keynes’s definition one asset liquidity another “more certainly realizable short notice without loss,” here, “realizable” mean capacity exchange narrow money or, even better, good services. where demand liquidity come from? the need liquidity arise perfect utopian world general equilibrium arrow’s debt contract complete calculable contingent claims. also, hick point out, liquidity demand appear traditional portfolio analysis, try expand add liquidity preference complement. but many way change assumption perfect general equilibrium analysis generate demand liquidity. for instance, rajan diamond (2001) assume asset

perspective liquidity consider order understand term use – also different perspective useful different type analysis. i mention four particular: 1. first, macroeconomic liquidity, refer broad monetary financial condition assess idea would adequate non-inflationary growth. these measure quantities, like money credit aggregate growth, price, interest rate shape yield curve. 2. second, market liquidity, refer easiness buy sell monetary financial market without change price. this depend breadth, depth resilience asset markets. 3. third, balance sheet liquidity, mean volume liquid asset mobilise short notice. 4. finally, fund liquidity – possibility face liquidity requirement either balance sheet commit credit lines. fund liquidity interact market liquidity, brunnermeier pedersen (2008)8 illustrate recent crisis. they demonstrate existence liquidity spiral type liquidity mutually reinforcing. these different concept course relate consider different degree form monetary authorities. with definition mind, ask ass present liquidity situation europe us. some observer tend look provision official liquidity central banks, claim “the world awash liquidity” write high inflation around corner – something encourage gold bugs. 6 the inside/outside liquidity concept completely overlap distinction private official liquidity, outside liquidity country level include

multiplier collapsed. indeed, look total liquidity europe see credit decrease monetary aggregate increase close nominal gdp. regard price indicators, development output, unemployment inflation market good service indicate situation total excessive liquidity. the ecb’s staff projection estimate inflation next year 1.3%, close 2%. a negative output gap high unemployment indicate full employment equilibrium real interest rate negative, impossible achieve approach nominal zero bound. so much market good service – asset markets? it true nominal interest rate low quite while, create risk asset

search yield financial institution begin affect price risky asset class – covenant–lite loans, reits, junk high yield bonds. what i like analysis abandon textbooks’ fiction asset price depend behaviour preference final consumer investors. instead, introduce “institution-driven” analysis, make price dependent incentive framework manager search yield (and bonus). this exactly raghuram 2005 paper. it indeed important consider institutions’ behaviour – think instance structural trend bank dealer reduce inventory bonds, consequent reduction liquidity secondary market may affect volatility, overshoot price spikes. point responsibility low interest rate create incentives, jeremy ask cautiously: “… would one really want raise rates, risk choke economic activity? wouldn’t good use narrowly focus supervisory regulatory approach le potential damage economy?” consider limitation macroprudential policy deal asset price booms, want exclude forever possibility use monetary policy help job. i recognise monetary policy cannot ignore financial stability considerations. in situation high credit growth threaten create asset price bubbles, i endorse possibility “leaning wind” approach monetary policy. excess credit, leverage asset price invariably lead crisis endanger medium term price stability. however, situation today different. none phenomenon identify jeremy u really present. moreover, institutional change crisis enhance instrument macroprudential policy and, i confident, reinforce policymakers’ disposition apply them. in view, macroprudential policy must therefore try serious way, priority. we recognise monetary policy cannot everything already much burden maintain price stability, provide adequate liquidity bank sector and, us, maintain low unemployment. 9 jeremy c. stein “overheating credit markets, origins, measurement policy responses” february 2013, speech federal reserve bank st. louis. 4 bi central bankers’ speech i consider europe ecb manage liquidity adequately pursuance goal ensure price stability medium-term basis – ensured, cater financial stability, output employment. nevertheless, risk inflation subside disappear, traditional role central bank lender last resort (lolr) tend come fore, aware moral hazard create – example bank become permanently dependent central bank money operate. this consideration add rationale justify two liquidity ratio introduce part basel iii agreement, make bank good prepare face liquidity stresses. how crisis affect way ecb conduct liquidity operations? in normal times, modern central bank manage provision primary liquidity view achieve target short term market rate – normally, overnight rate. the ecb, like modern central banks, conduct monetary policy mandatory remunerate reserve corridor around policy rate define two stand facilities. this mean signal one particular policy rate coexist different level bank reserve – long “liquidity management operations” ensure liquidity provide neither excessive insufficient relation demand profit maximise bank react opportunity cost reserves. what matter manage liquidity target policy rate amount liquidity necessary achieve it. in case, keep bank sector liquidity deficit supply liquidity via lend bank system auctions. other central bank supply liquidity mostly outright purchase securities, normally short-term government paper. both model liquidity provision change crisis. in case us, federal reserve start buy long maturity private paper. in case, october 2008 abandon system auction variable rate enter mode fix rate, full allotment – supply much liquidity banks’ demanded, provide eligible collateral pledge. on top this, december 2011 february 2012, launch extraordinary operation 3-year maturity total 1 trillion euro. the net increase monetary base around 500 billion euro bank reduce use short maturity facilities. our particular method supply primary liquidity make future absorption liquidity excess minimum reserve requirement easy achieve. bank repay borrow maturity reached. in reality, situation improved, anticipate repayment ltros. they repay 362 billion euro (or 64% net increase 500 billion euro) excess liquidity, reach peak 813 billion euro march 2012, fall 218 billion euro. we exit quietly smoothly extraordinary phase high central bank liquidity provision. however, new mode conduct monetary policy also present challenges. a overnight market rate determine volume excess liquidity size corridor policy rate deposit facility rate, difficult influence level – correspondingly, influence short term money market rates. for instance, excess liquidity keep declining, determine banks, may pressure short rate increase. to picture also add international dimension – notably risk spillover us. we already saw announcement taper outright purchase result high money market rate europe. in overall context, decide introduce important change policy, announce form forward guidance. we state keep key interest rate bi central

business calendar recognise achievement private sector, particular case, small business fiji. these award conceive around idea need u stop salute small business great thing country. let u celebrate winners, also others dare back entrepreneurial spirit set business. we trust event create necessary awareness “mum dad” type enterprises. we hope encourage grow strength strength become much large business future. there course many example cite large successful fijian company start virtually nothing. the small business award today actually 10th anniversary fdb’s small business award i honor share achievement you. i applaud fiji development bank organise competition years. the fact sustain show fdb’s commitment energy towards grow fijian economy assist small players, particularly, provide access credit. one major challenge small business give money start sustain initial operations? the winner i inform year seven award categories: – agriculture, tourism, wholesale & retail, professional & business services, manufacturing, best business practice award special award. that pretty much cover everything. lady gentlemen, far gender balance go come small businesses, woman clearly drive force. unfortunately beat u men “hands down”. last year’s award saw woman entrepreneur win five seven awards. a man, always difficult painful one explain fijian men suffer well know “malua” fever, large phenomenon across globe. study actually show woman entrepreneur conduct small business drive force are, far, successful men – and, dare i say it, empowerment level, say contribute gdp. 2 bi central bankers’ speech indeed one micro finance institution operate fiji, part pacific region, lend ladies, reason woman likely pay back loan interest! south pacific business development currently nearly 3,900 lady client fijian micro loan portfolio repayment rate excess 95 percent. clearly men need step plate counted. so, i judge awards, (and i would wish influence anyone), hopefully may see change year prize hand – prove study wrong! it would remiss mention great example one small businesswoman entrepreneur rid path success. makereta matemosi overall winner 2007 fiji development bank

activity price japan monetary policy speech mr yoshihisa morimoto, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, iwate, 29 august 2013. * * * i. recent financial economic development price development a. overseas development 1. overseas economy first, i talk key development overseas economy likely affect outlook japan’s economy. with recovery u.s. economy start clearly gain hold, overseas economy whole gradually head toward pick-up, although lackluster performance partly seen. a outlook, overseas economy likely start recovering, albeit moderate pace. however, amid sluggish growth emerge economies, pace recovery expect remain moderate whole. i consider region detail. 2. u.s. economy despite downward pressure fiscal side, u.s. economy moderate recovery trend backdrop steady private demand. a employment situation, total nonfarm payroll employment increase almost 200,000 month, unemployment rate downtrend. in household sector, although tax increase begin year continue effect, employment situation follow improve trend asset price rising, household spending, include private consumption house investment, firm. take look corporate sector, business sentiment improve back firm private demand, although pick-up production moderate partly reflect large cut government expenditures. for time being, close attention need pay fiscal issue – particularly federal debt ceiling problem – development financial market well effect on, instance, house investment. if household spend continue uptrend, however, could lead firm gradually become proactive, thus strengthen recovery momentum economy whole. furthermore, benefit shale gas revolution could help boost economic activity, mainly reduce volume crude oil imports, low energy prices, increase business fix investment relate sectors. 3. euro area economy in euro area, european debt problem drag on, adverse feedback loop among fiscal situation, financial system, economic activity take hold – particularly peripheral country – economic activity recede slowly. look unemployment rates, range low 6–7 percent germany high 26 percent spain, indicate widen regional disparity business sentiment. recently, however, gradually grow sign bottom out. business consumer sentiment area – include peripheral country – improve situation financial market stabilize somewhat european authority modify stringent fiscal consolidation plans, temporarily ease measures. export also bottom out, gdp growth april-june quarter turn positive first time seven quarters. with development continuing, euro area economy likely bottom head toward pick-up. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 4. china’s economy with regard emerge economies, chinese economy continue see stable growth background firm domestic demand, evidence particular stable private consumption reflect favorable employment income situation rise fix asset investment, grow year-on-year rate 20 percent. nevertheless, china’s economic growth rate relatively low level around 7.5 percent. underlie structural reform chinese authority engage in, emphasize quality-based growth low income disparities. specifically, one area focus measure curb excess production capacity rapid expansion credit accompany 4 trillion renminbi stimulus package implement wake global financial crisis. the so-called shadow bank system another focal point. the chinese authority proceed policy response contain risk overly rapid credit expansion bank well non-banks. a result, total social finance – measure aggregate credit supply economy mainly consist loan corporate bond – increase slow pace. although structural reform tend restrain growth, authority also make clear remain vigilant regard economic growth, state fine-tune policy timely manner achieve growth rate 7.5 percent 2013. with authority aim well-balanced, sustainable growth, chinese economy likely continue grow steadily current pace. 5. uncertainty regard overseas economy uncertainty overseas economy require careful monitor include (1) effect speculation direction u.s. monetary policy financial market emerge commodity-exporting economies, (2) development chinese economy, (3) prospect european debt problem. in unite states, federal reserve’s taper asset purchase become matter discussion. the background moderate steady recovery u.s. economy, recovery positive development world economy. furthermore, federal open market committee (fomc) repeatedly convey message begin adjust pace asset purchase continue substantial improvement outlook labor market. although stance federal reserve gradually understand market, market participant case withdraw fund market emerge commodity-exporting economy anticipation eventual taper federal reserve’s asset purchases, risk similar response future remains. the world economy’s momentum recovery still weak, high uncertainty regard possible effect financial market economic activity event rapid outflow funds. a chinese economy, key point focus whether able maintain stable growth. specifically, necessary pay close attention whether, grapple various challenge overcapacity manufacture sector income disparity achieve stable growth, authority restrain credit expansion, shadow bank system pace exceed economic growth, steadily proceed structural reform rebalancing economy investment consumption. uncertainty regard european debt problem remains, even though extreme tail risk potential disintegration euro, fear one time, receded. however, market tension could rise yet effort strengthen economic financial union euro area push fiscal reform see retreat. political development euro member country warrant vigilance, start outcome german federal election schedule september. geopolitical risks, particularly middle east, also require close attention. bi central bankers’ speech 3 b. japan’s economy price 1. current state outlook japan’s economy i explain current state of, outlook for, japan’s economy give overseas economic development i outlined. japan’s economy relatively weak second half 2012 export production decrease mainly reflect deceleration overseas economies, turn adversely affect domestic demand business fix investment manufacture sector. economic conditions, however, become favorable since begin 2013. recently, domestic demand, particular public investment private consumption, firm, export pick situation overseas economy gradually head toward pick-up, industrial production increase moderately. against backdrop, june 2013 tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) show significant improvement business sentiment manufacture sector, greatly benefit correction yen’s appreciation, also across wide range sector include nonmanufacturing, well upward revision firms’ business forecast regard profit fix investment. take account level economic activity rise moderately virtuous cycle income spend gradually start operating, bank japan, monetary policy meet hold july 10 11, 2013, raise basic assessment domestic economy, assessment economy “has pick up” assessment “is start recover moderately.” a outlook, export expect increase moderately, mainly reflect pick-up overseas economy correction yen’s appreciation. a domestic demand, public investment house investment expect continue trend upward, business fix investment project increase moderately reflect improvement corporate profit employment situation, private consumption expect remain resilient. in situation, industrial production also expect increase moderately, judge interview firm relevant information. against backdrop development demand home abroad well production, japan’s economy expect recover moderately. let elaborate development moment. due part correction yen’s appreciation rise stock price since end 2012, business consumer sentiment improved, improvement likely help underpin private consumption time gradually entice firm increase spending. increase private consumption particularly evident among middle-aged elderly, hold stock age groups. consumption activity baby-boom generation expect remain firm due high propensity consume generation firms’ effort capture new demand. meanwhile, business fix investment project increase moderately, mainly due resumption postpone investment maintenance replacement item machinery investment relate disaster prevention energy. upward pressure economy public demand side expect gather full momentum see fact value public work contracted, lead indicator public investment, already increase significantly. the key ensure trend toward economic recovery continue achieve price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) improvement business performance lead increase employee income. look recent employment income situation, supply demand condition labor market improved, evident unemployment rate active job openings-to-applicants ratio, year-on-year rate change number employee positive. in situation, despite downward pressure result uptrend ratio part-time employees, year-on-year rate change nominal wage per employee turn slightly positive, special cash 4 bi central bankers’ speech earn june – include summer bonus payment – show increase first time three years. while uncertainty regard outlook remains, bank would like confirm whether development also lead rise schedule cash earnings. keep point mind, i would like summarize outlook japan’s economy next three fiscal years. while economy affect front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior two schedule consumption tax hikes, likely continue grow pace potential, trend, virtuous cycle among production, income, spend maintained. in bank’s interim assessment july april 2013 outlook economic activity price (hereafter outlook report), median policy board members’ forecast economic growth rate somewhat high 2.8 percent fiscal 2013 due effect various economic measure front-loaded increase demand, 1.3 percent fiscal 2014 partly due subsequent decline demand, 1.5 percent fiscal 2015. 2. price next, i talk price developments. the year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) negative territory april 2013, recently turn positive first time 14 months, partly reflect correction yen’s appreciation. energy price include petroleum product electricity rising, increase cost raw material start pass sale price of, example, foodstuffs. sale price import consumer good personal computer handbag also raised. recently, sign change firms’ price-setting behavior, include introduction higher-end product service area within food service industry. under circumstances, firms’ forecast supply demand condition price june 2013 tankan clearly improved. a outlook, year-on-year rate increase cpi likely rise, reflect factor improvement aggregate supply demand balance due recovery japan’s economy well rise medium- long-term inflation expectation response fundamental change public’s expectations. the rate increase cpi likely reach around 2 percent – price stability target – toward latter half projection period, span fiscal 2014 fiscal 2015, overall economy improve balance sustainable manner. specifically, bank’s interim assessment july april 2013 outlook report, median policy board members’ forecast year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food; fiscal 2014 fiscal 2015, exclude direct effect consumption tax hikes) 0.6 percent fiscal 2013, 1.3 percent fiscal 2014, 1.9 percent fiscal 2015. ii. conduct monetary policy a. introduction “quantitative qualitative monetary easing” (qqe) 1. framework qqe next, i would like turn bank’s conduct monetary policy. in order japan’s economy overcome deflation early possible achieve sustainable growth price stability, bank introduce january 2013 price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi. it concurrently release joint statement government, government bank clearly acknowledge role play state would work together overcome deflation achieve sustainable economic growth. then, april, bank introduce qqe achieve price stability target early possible time, time horizon two years. this policy measure represent considerable departure bank’s previous practice term quantity (the size increase amount bi central bankers’ speech 5 currency provide bank) quality (the type asset bank purchase increase amount currency). specifically, bank decide upon following. first, view pursue quantitative monetary easing, bank change main operate target money market operation uncollateralized overnight call rate monetary base, sum banknote circulation, coin circulation, current account deposit hold financial institution bank. on basis, bank increase monetary base annual pace 60–70 trillion yen, thus double two years. second, bank purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) amount outstanding increase annual pace 50 trillion yen. a result, amount outstanding jgbs hold bank likely double two years. moreover, bank extend average remain maturity jgb purchase slightly le three year seven years. it note practice average remain maturity subject fluctuations, depend bid financial institutions; thus, appropriate allow range six eight years. and third, bank purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) amount outstanding increase annual pace 1 trillion yen 30 billion yen, respectively. the bank continue qqe – consist measure – aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. it examine upside downside risk economic activity prices, make adjustment appropriate. in order achieve price stability target, important create virtuous cycle price rise moderately along balance sustainable improvement economic activity accompany increase corporate profits, employment, wages. furthermore, order fully ensure effectiveness monetary easing, important government ensure market credibility fiscal consolidation. japan face serious fiscal imbalances, credibility fiscal management decline, long-term interest rate would likely rise manner inconsistent economic price developments. the government indicate joint statement release january would steadily promote measure aim establish sustainable fiscal structure. moreover, medium-term fiscal plan, approve august 8, 2013, state target halve primary deficit-to-gdp ratio fiscal 2015 achieve surplus primary balance fiscal 2020. base targets, expect government continue make effort toward fiscal consolidation. 2. transmission channel qqe the transmission channel qqe follows. first, purchase financial asset encourage decline long-term interest rate risk premium assets. this help increase firms’ households’ investment consumption low fund cost wealth effects. second, financial institution institutional investor expect change investment behavior rebalance portfolio loan and/or risk assets, stocks, pursuit high returns. this refer portfolio rebalancing effect. this effect may strengthen growth potential japan’s economy risk money increasingly allocate wide range emerge firms, example. and third, clear commitment achieve price stability target early possible time continuation massive purchase asset expect drastically change expectation market economic entities. with channel act together, qqe contribute push price raise inflation expectation and, stimulate private demand, improve aggregate supply demand balance. 3. financial market development since introduction qqe look development economic activity financial market since introduction qqe, monetary base increase annual pace 60–70 trillion yen – line bank’s guideline money market operation – owe progress 6 bi central bankers’ speech bank’s large-scale jgb purchase proceed qqe. despite instability observe jgb market onset, intend effect qqe seem begin materialize whole, favorable development spread economic activity financial markets. meanwhile, financial condition remain accommodative. in term firms’ fund costs, average contract interest rate new loan discount low, reach historical low, year-on-year rate increase amount outstanding bank lend increase somewhat range around 2 percent. issue condition cp corporate bond continue favorable whole, several major corporate bond issues. the year-on-year rate growth money stock (m2) increase high level since 1999, reach almost 4 percent. look financial markets, money market rate maturity stable, hover level slightly 0.1 percent. long-term interest rate exhibit increase volatility temporarily reach 1 percent, regain stability bank conduct jgb purchase flexible manner maintain close dialogue market participants. japan’s long-term interest rate generally flat spite rise overseas long-term interest rate reflect speculation direction u.s. monetary policy, recently contain level 0.7–0.8 percent, historical average. meanwhile, say inflation expectation rise trend whole, evidence (1) rise diffusion index output price june 2013 tankan well rise inflation expectation firms, households, economists, (2) upturn market-related indicator follow halt decline. under circumstances, real interest rate – calculate nominal interest rate minus expect inflation rate – decline trend. if inflation expectation rise, would exert upward pressure long-term interest rates. the key strengthen monetary ease effect therefore lie maintain real interest rate relatively low level, exert downward pressure nominal interest rate compression risk premium (including term premiums). a outlook, downward pressure interest rate likely become increasingly pronounce bank proceed large-scale jgb purchases. in situation, portfolio rebalancing – investor financial institution use invest fund jgbs shift investment lend asset – likely spread steadily. reflect wealth effect bring rise stock price since begin year improvement corporate profit due correction yen’s appreciation, business household sentiment recently improve fundraise private sector increase moderately. look ahead, effect qqe economic activity become increasingly pronounced, virtuous cycle – positive development economic activity change expectation bring improvement economic activity increase inflation expectation – would enable bank achieve 2 percent price stability target. b. loan support program in order maintain virtuous cycle, important firm household actually make use accommodative financial condition fund increase investment spending, turn lead improvement aggregate supply demand balance. however, although positive development observe demand credit, many firm still borrow finance business fix investment instead invest much cash flow allow. to promote full use accommodative financial condition firm households, bank – addition implement aggressive monetary ease measure – establish loan support program. the program consist two measures: fund-provisioning measure stimulate bank lend (hereafter stimulate bank lend facility) fund-provisioning bi central bankers’ speech 7 measure support strengthen foundation economic growth (hereafter growth-supporting fund facility). 1. the stimulate bank lend facility the stimulate bank lend facility introduce aim prompt financial institution take active lend stance stimulate great proactive credit demand firm households. with facility, bank provide long-term yen-denominated fund low interest rate financial institution increase lending, request, amount equivalent net increase lend period five quarter – january-march 2013 quarter end january-march 2014 quarter – base period october-december 2012 quarter. there shall upper limit total amount fund provide bank facility. the lending, base net increase calculated, either yen-denominated foreign currency-denominated. japanese firms’ international operation well financial institutions’ activity provide fund operation play important role capture global demand, bank’s measure support lend firm locate overseas lend domestic financial institutions’ overseas office – include foreign currency-denominated lend – contribute strengthen japan’s growth potential. in first loan disbursement facility june 2013, loan amount much 3.1 trillion yen, underline strong demand funds. 2. the growth-supporting fund facility the growth-supporting fund facility introduce aim support flow fund area growth potential. the bank introduce facility because, order overcome deflation achieve sustainable economic growth price stability, bank deem important (1) reverse downward trend japan’s growth rate face unparalleled decline birthrate age population, (2) increase medium- long-term growth expectation japan’s economy, (3) put japan’s economy high medium- long-term growth path. with facility, bank provide long-term fund – yen-denominated foreign currency-denominated – low interest rate financial institution lend investment area expect contribute strengthen japan’s growth potential, medical nurse care; environment energy; agriculture, forestry, fisheries; tourism. the total amount lend arrangement set 5.5 trillion yen, current amount outstanding nearly 4 trillion yen. the amount lend investment actually provide private financial institution use facility greatly exceed amount loan disburse bank, demonstrate usefulness catalyst. these measure expect continue promote lend activity financial institution lead increase firms’ proactive demand credit, business fix investment. in order sustain cycle strengthen economy’s growth potential, necessary help private economic entity realize potential fullest. in addition support financial side, therefore important build economic environment innovation broad sense – include development new business model – achieve easily. recently, firm make active effort wide range area capitalize social changes, include business focus elderly, environment energy, information telecommunications. such development need support policy side well. moreover, secure labor force increase flexibility labor market another significant issue. the labor force participation rate woman currently form m-shaped curve, decline 70 percent woman age 25 45. if rate rise gradually result great support work mother pursue career raise children, decrease labor force overall would moderated. moreover, increase number age 60 participate labor force, would possible maintain labor force current 8 bi central bankers’ speech level time being, even face decline birthrate age population. in joint statement bank release january 2013, government make clear intention formulate measure strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy promote strongly, order revitalize economy. in government’s japan revitalization strategy formulate june, three action plan – (1) plan revitalization japanese industry, (2) strategic market creation plan, (3) strategy global outreach – lay concrete measure give top priority among step form growth strategy. if measure steadfastly implement firms’ growth expectation rise result, give decline real interest rates, would enhance stimulative effect monetary easing. the bank, part, also continue make utmost contributions. c. effort financial side response great east japan earthquake i would like talk bank’s effort financial side follow great east japan earthquake. since immediately earthquake, financial institution disaster area make strenuous effort maintain function financial settlement system restore office establish temporary ones. they also respond need people firm disaster area various respects, permit withdrawal deposit case depositor lose passbook, allow exchange damage banknote coins, provide support fund disaster-stricken firms. more recently, institution provide strong support restoration local economies, mainly business match support corporate turnarounds. from immediately earthquake, bank swiftly take range measures, provision ample liquidity enhancement monetary easing, focus three major aspects: maintain function financial settlement systems, ensure stability financial markets, support economy. in situation, april 2011 bank decide introduce funds-supplying operation provide financial institution disaster area longer-term fund low interest rate order lend support initial effort meet demand fund restoration rebuilding. it also decide broaden range eligible collateral money market operations. a former operation, deadline new application loan initially set end-october 2011, six month introduction, successively extend thereafter current deadline end-april 2014. look usage loan funds-supplying operation support financial institution disaster areas, amount outstanding loan year earthquake reach 500 billion yen vis-à-vis 1 trillion yen ceiling, recently 400 billion yen. the reason financial institution disaster area make little use loan operation relative ceiling fund condition generally favorable receive fund reconstruction various sources. nevertheless, operation regard effective provide safety valve unanticipated demand funds, provide leeway institution effort meet demand fund restoration rebuilding. a disaster area expect see increase demand fund reconstruction progresses, bank continue provide firm support financial institution engage reconstruction effort allow active lending. bi central bankers’ speech 1 joachim nagel: how market segment change crisis – challenge future bank speech dr joachim nagel, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, ese (the european supervisor education initiative) conference 2013 “the future european financial supervision”, frankfurt main, 26 september 2013. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman i delight speak year’s european supervisor education (ese) conference. the idea ese initiative bring together experience practitioner theoretical knowledge academic researchers. the bundesbank always consider important issue has, founder member, support initiative beginning. a expert bank supervision, i try tell anything new recent regulatory changes. instead, focus lie change market condition – partly trigger new regulation – impact banking, especially bank funding. the challenge currently face european bank sector reflect remarkable change refinance pattern european bank capital interbank money markets. a central banker, i special interest development money markets, first main topic. subsequently, i discus regulatory aspect liquidity coverage ratio possible impact capital markets. thereafter, i would like describe change repo market ongoing trend towards clear via central counterparties, follow discussion development market cover assets. before i summarise, i cover sovereign bond market. 2. money market condition since financial crisis up 2007, euro interbank money market characterise small counterparty risk premia highly liquid markets. risk aversion low, significant trust in, among, banks. a consequence financial crisis sudden loss confidence counterparties, overall turnover euro money market decline significantly, especially unsecured segment. even today, unsecured trade maturity long three month rare. at time, importance secure market activity increased, reflect heighten concern counterparty risk. at current juncture, turnover secure segment three time high unsecured segment. secure trade limit credit risk, lender suffer loss counterparty pledge collateral default simultaneously. a limit credit risk become fundamental concern crisis, importance increasingly attach liquidity collateral market associate collateral pricing. the grow share secure trade via electronic trade platform explain mainly increase turnover secure segment. these platform offer clear service central counterparties (ccps). ccps limit counterparty credit risk mitigate information asymmetry within market. a ccp guarantee transaction define quality standard both, participant accept collateral, information individual counterparties become le important. by act intermediary trade partners, ccp enable trade anonymously platforms. this help stress market participant peripheral country access collateralised money market throughout crisis. in spite positive effects, increase importance ccps harbour risk contagion effects. the default one 2 bi central bankers’ speech central highly connect interbank participant might serious impact markets. the uncertainty involve transaction bank different country another consequence. the eurosystem become important counterparty euro money market. before first tension felt, eurosystem generally ensure broadly balance liquidity conditions. credit institution aggregate allot much liquidity need give autonomous factors. with full allotment policy, liquidity provision increase sharply. a consequence low market rate relative deposit facility amid concern credit quality counterparties, clear preference emerge store liquidity central bank account rather lend interbank market. in short, liquidity flow bank much small crisis. the eurosystem’s central intermediary role become even evident start supply long-term liquidity via one-year three-year longer-term refinance operation (ltros). the three-year ltros introduce support bank lending. furthermore, ease tension sovereign bond market peripheral countries, bank intensify government bond purchases. however, observe strong preference part bank buy bond issue home countries. this amplify interdependence bank sector domestic sovereign bond market certain euro-area country aggravate exist geographical segmentation. the geographical segmentation reflect european banks’ reliance eurosystem refinancing. after lehman insolvency, reliance initially increase country risk aversion rose. later, segmentation develop differently across countries, reflect perceive riskiness country. more recently, eurosystem policy mitigate market segmentation safeguard appropriate monetary policy transmission, namely announce outright monetary transaction (omts), mirror reduce country differences. but justification omts. it ease market tensions, especially redomination risk. nonetheless, bundesbank’s concern still extremely relevant. country difference regard reliance eurosystem refinance remain large, indicate share banks’ balance sheet finance eurosystem liquidity. this also become obvious structure early repayment three-year ltros. it mainly bank locate core country reduce outstanding volumes. furthermore, reliance national counterparties increased. over last years, euro-area cross-border activity decline constantly. 3. regulatory change reaction crisis impact market structure bank the experience recent financial crisis trigger regulatory changes, especially bank sector. the new basel iii bank standard address root cause financial crisis aim prevent another build-up liquidity solvency risks. the basel iii framework liquidity risk regulation encompass two ratio – liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) net stable fund ratio (nsfr). both impact bank manage business activities. a lcr introduce early detail far developed, i discus impact euro money markets. however, lcr might yet revise final implementation. with regard asset side bank’s balance sheet, bank primarily purchase high quality liquid asset (hqla) improve lcr compliance. hold asset outright improve lcr. demand asset likely increase, potentially cause trade premium. this regulatory-driven additional demand might reduce appetite lower-quality liquid assets. turn liability side, bank lcr one need substitute short-term longer-term funding. this could reduce volume short-term unsecured bi central bankers’ speech 3 interbank market, though bank probably continue engage significant short-term unsecured trade daily liquidity management purposes, still need fulfil reserve requirements. central bank monitor impact new liquidity regulation monetary policy implementation. unlike interbank funding, central bank refinance 30-day horizon would count outflow lcr, always benefit 100% rollover rate. this could increase demand central bank refinancing. if non-hqla use collateral, would reduction numerator and, therefore, lcr would rise. bank may therefore choose boost cash reserve central bank (which count hqla) increase central bank refinance back non-hqla collateral. while also depend opportunity cost obtain liquidity eurosystem, may number bank large amount collateral classify liquid basel iii eligible monetary policy operations. however, interaction lcr monetary policy operation money market acknowledged. in january 2013, change lcr announced. in particular, timetable fully phase lcr requirement extend 2015 2019. additionally, list hqla broaden punctual recalibration net cash outflow give bank time recover crisis implement lcr orderly manner. this likely reduce level market fragmentation might otherwise arise bank meet lcr 100% requirement 2015. in general, basel iii right answer lesson learn crisis. nonetheless, impact market pattern bank behaviour monitor carefully prevent undesirable developments. 4. repo market the net impact bank’s liquidity position increase level repo fund somewhat complex, overall tend improve lcr encourage great level secure funding, irrespective duration. however, high demand good liquid asset may reduce supply repo market – potentially reduce liquidity secure repo market add market volatility, particularly time stress. secure transactions, especially transaction via ccps, reanimate money market time high uncertainty. this also reflect fact share international counterparties trade platform gc pool increase crisis. one reason become apparent financial crisis big well-established counterparties, too, become illiquid insolvent. under circumstances, collateralisation become important. however, grow gap: importance collateral quality rise sharply, time, high quality liquid collateral become limit factor. furthermore, ability increase debt fund repo transaction also limit regulatory change future. additionally, ample liquidity provide eurosystem, especially via two three-year ltros, together enlarge collateral framework eurosystem refinance lead reduce activity market segment, too. the decisive question market participant whether eurosystem stick reduce non-standard monetary policy measure full allotment policy enlarge collateral framework. give decline excess liquidity related, particular, early repayment three-year ltros, new business model may arise medium term banks’ fund need pick again. it therefore market participant find new balance risk benefit relation cross-border lending. furthermore, importance banks’ collateral management enhance consequence crisis. credit institution aim manage collateral 4 bi central bankers’ speech efficiently without take additional risks. ccps use trade platform contribute this. another important factor repo market future plan financial transaction tax (ftt). in current design, may harm short-term repo market segment, even low tax rate 0.1% trade sovereign bond represent high burden short-term revolve repo transactions. to illustrate problem, i would like give example: over-night repo transaction current interest rate 0.04% volume eur 10 million, total eur 10,011 (ie eur 11 interest eur 10.000 ftt) paid. the tax-free use marginal lend facility eurosystem involve payment eur 278 interest. fund via repo market would 36-times expensive central bank refinancing. such financial transaction tax would probably reduce repo market activity encourage eurosystem refinancing. that desirable. 5. market cover asset turn longer-term fund instruments, i would first like mention eu banks’ total issuance debt fund drop 12% year year first half 2013 low level since 2002. besides ample liquidity provide eurosystem, reduce banks’ demand additional funding, regulatory change result bank seek reduce reliance wholesale fund favour deposit retail small business customers. the decrease borrow also reflect pressure face banks, need smaller, robust balance sheets, concern among investor “bail-in” rules. consequently, bank may face high fund cost investor demand compensation increase risk lose money. in addition, high asset encumbrance impact unsecured bank creditors. the bank asset use secure funding, le remain secure investor unsecured instrument case insolvency. they price risk premium form bank funding. a money market, observe fragmentation core peripheral country europe. the perceive risk financial sector periphery core euro area start diverge back 2010 financial crisis turn sovereign debt crisis. still, individual quality banks’ balance sheet influence investment decision significantly. bank locate peripheral country reduce issuance high degree. development home economy stress balance sheets, namely share non-performing-loans. furthermore, nexus sovereign financial sector credit risk make fund lot expensive, impossible, them. therefore many bank still highly dependent eurosystem funding. the low demand also make felt volume secure instrument issued, although market have, since crisis, display preference secure funding. cover bond issuance volume decline give ample liquidity supply eurosystem tendency towards balance-sheet deleveraging. in first seven month 2013, volume newly issue cover bond denominate euro decrease 38%. issuance volume therefore reach low level since 2009. give volume mature cover bond significantly exceed issues, result excess demand narrow cover bond spread bunds. the u taper discussion, start end may, lead widen spreads, especially peripheral issuers. the overall improvement market sentiment regard european sovereign debt crisis enable bank locate peripheral country step issuance. the share issue volume eur 500 million eur 1 billion, call “mini-jumbos”, grown. this development attribute grow importance good asset-liability management result regulatory change require, amongst others, good maturity match. bi central bankers’ speech 5 another secure fund market, ab market, still suffer financial crisis, partly cause excessive developments. therefore, strict regulatory rule regard ab important prevent similar development future. however, bear mind ab market quite heterogeneous. “plain vanilla” ab back high-quality asset fairly safe investment wrongly get bad reputation. to increase investor confidence, eurosystem support ab market promote “loan level data initiative”, significantly improve transparency regard underlie assets. in turn, allow eurosystem relax collateral requirement ab recently. ab one prominent asset class use collateral eurosystem refinance operations. however, recently, cover bond government bond gain importance. nearly half ab issue place publicly first half 2013 compare one-third second half 2012. this show improvement market. spread secondary market also narrow significantly last 12 months. however, portuguese government crisis june demonstrate political incident influence ab spread directly. although portugal relatively small country, development strong impact spread ab back asset originate bank peripheral countries, especially spain. in term different type abs, residential mortgage-backed security (rmbs) still represent far big share market. while ab back loan small medium-sized enterprise (sme abs) represent sizeable share market, many issue retain use directly collateral eurosystem refinance operations. however, eurosystem belief sme ab could represent sizeable source bank financing. they could encourage lend smes foster transmission monetary policy indirectly ease lend condition smes. in press conference hold 2 may, ecb president draghi therefore announce consultation european institution “initiatives promote function market asset-backed security collateralised loan non-financial corporations”. this statement back announcement 18 july ecb continue investigate possible acceptance certain guarantee mezzanine tranche sme abs. another structure instrument i would like mention contingent convertible (cocos), could complement banks’ various refinance instruments. a fairly new instrument lot different arrangements, difficult estimate exact scope market segment. coco useful instrument increase capital base time stress. they automatically turn core tier 1 capital trigger – mostly core capital rate – undershot. investor compensate extra risk alongside default risk subordination risk case insolvency. recently, additional spread shrink consequence increase “search yield” low interest rate environment. consequently, coco may become establish fund instrument although bear risk convert even write zero. a i approach end speech, i would like focus market change lot crisis also play prominent role central bank politics: sovereign bond market. 6. sovereign bond market government bond market suffer ongoing bank crisis, especially turn sovereign debt crisis. they long consider homogeneous, risk-free asset class. investors’ willingness take risk diminish sharply. volatility liquidity become important topic market participants. bond buyer exercise great scrutiny series rat downgrade prompt investor re-evaluate belief european 6 bi central bankers’ speech government bond risk-free assets. this lead differentiate perception european government bond diverge yield individual countries. to certain degree, increase spread seem justified. they reflect diverge fundamental different country – ie different economic situation level public debt. it questionable whether convergence yield year crisis reflect right assessment various risk underlie investments. currently, refinance condition peripheral country improve notably. hence, omt hopefully never activated. however, market sentiment change quickly. in january 2010, greece receive offer eur 25 billion five-year government bond issue volume eur 8 billion. a couple week later, greece long able refinance liability via capital market. although currently small improvement gdp growth several european countries, risk renew tension sovereign debt market still alive give low growth slow implementation reform one hand expect taper fed’s quantitative ease programme hand. low investor confidence, besides send european government bond yield cd premia high secondary markets, also impact primary markets. the space leave external creditor occupy domestic investor banks, increase investment particularly follow introduction three-year ltros. the trend towards renationalisation development need monitored. it reinforce interdependence sovereign sector domestic bank system. european bank often invest sovereign bond home countries. credit institution must increase risk awareness term sovereign bonds. on one hand, bank credit limit individual countries. this would reduce dependency certain debtors. on hand, bond secure sufficient level equity. in medium term, government bond treat like corporate bonds. experience teach u sovereign bond risk-free asset. furthermore, risk-appropriate treatment would lead increase yield country unsound finances. therefore, market regulation would provide incentive fiscal discipline. the current initiative establish effective single supervisory mechanism step right direction. it help u identify risk early stage therefore also important disentangle critical link sovereign bank funding. however, bank union, consist sound single supervisory mechanism single resolution mechanism, future project prevent future problems. exist burden treat separately. they arise national responsibility mutualised. therefore, plan financial inventory banks’ balance sheet crucial need close examination. bank sustainable business model keep alive public financial support. 7. close remark overall, stress level market european government bond bank refinance diminish significantly since summer 2012. nevertheless, question whether interbank market return former integrate status remain open. secure trade connection use ccps may play crucial role change environment reduce counterparty risk help improve collateral management. the ongoing repayment three-year ltros reduce excess liquidity money market could interpret suggest market participant long need much access central bank liquidity before. but let unequivocal one thing: development induce markets, trigger eurosystem. bi central bankers’ speech 7 furthermore, bank focus achieve reasonable mix short-term fund refinance via longer-term repos bond issues. this could help alleviate current tendency bank leave cash reserve ecb’s deposit facility rather offer interbank market. this would important step towards re-establishing well-integrated money market euro area. the regulatory step undertake basel iii go right direction, impact market carefully considered. in bank sector, business model need adjustments, ultimately result resilient diversify sector sustainable risk-return profile. in current low interest rate environment, surely easy task increase earnings. however, development far go right direction eg german banks’ average equity base improve considerably since begin crisis. for twenty big credit institutions, core capital rate double average. nonetheless, interconnectedness bank home country monitor closely hold strong contagion risk. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stefan ingves: the evolution basel committee welcome keynote address mr stefan ingves, governor sverige riksbank chairman basel committee bank supervision, symposium mark 25 year basel capital accord “25 year international financial regulation: challenge opportunities”, basel, 26 september 2013. * * * good morning everyone. on behalf basel committee, i would like welcome today’s symposium, committee host mark 25 year since first basel accord bank capital established. and let time also acknowledge jaime caruana bis, host event, also unwavering support committee past almost 40 years. a many know, basel committee start 1974 basel committee bank regulation supervisory practices. in aftermath herstatt collapse, g10 governor day seek way preserve promote stability international financial system. it worth reflect morning, discus committee’s achievement date, basic problem encounter today – poorly run institutions, interconnectedness financial instability – face committee founded. this imply nothing achieved: contrary, great deal do world benefit greatly. but, despite efforts, bank regularly lose money old way: pursue profits, growth market share without adequate heed risk. unfortunately, often find clever new way this, isn’t always easy see old habit repeated. while today’s committee member are, i’m sure, look respite ambitious work programme post-crisis reforms, also need recognise nobody guarantee crisis-free future. therefore, must remain vigilant old risk re-emerge new shape forms. i speak shortly key influence shape evolution basel committee years. before i start, however, i would like warmly welcome number special guest today: • first let welcome peter cooke. have head committee decade, peter longest-serving chair – and, probably person, instrumental lay foundation committee’s subsequent achievements. indeed, contribution best highlight fact that, many years, people refer basel committee, “cooke committee” “cooke ratio” – although i know peter first acknowledge credit accord share many. peter – please wife julia u today. • let also acknowledge number peter’s colleague committee critical period 1986–88 accord settled. i delight able join u today. • finally, i would especially like welcome paul volcker symposium. paul instrumental within g10 governor push international benchmark bank capital. in particular, together robin leigh-pemberton bank england, critical forge agreement produce world’s first international standard bank capital. paul – i don’t think much say great deal today’s global financial regulation found original vision. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a scene-setter morning’s discussions, i would offer think key influence evolution committee date. the basel committee activity change almost beyond recognition since establishment 1974, even since 1988 first accord agreed. i doubt whether found governor really foresee committee would eventually become: international standard setter, also one conduct peer review members’ compliance agreements. indeed, had, i suspect might committee’s establishment first place! but time change, financial sector evolved, committee move times. among many factor influence work committee years, i think i would identify five shape committee today continue guide activity future. the first obvious evolution coordinate information-sharing group one become standard setter. although 1975 concordat committee’s first substantive agreement, first public document, standard per se: rather, sensible agreement supervisory responsibility could divide bank operate across national boundaries. it goal modest: make sure bank could escape supervision. it try harmonise supervisory standards. and, course, primarily direct supervisors, bank themselves. in subsequent years, committee pronounce international lend foreign exchange positions. these document begin set expectation way bank manage risks, standard way use word today. it first basel accord really mark new role committee. a 1974, severe crisis trigger step – case, latin american debt crisis early 1980s, raise political pressure bank increase capital base regulator create international level play field respect. since then, committee’s role standard setter grow – extent that, today, see primary purpose. whereas committee take 10 year publish first 10 documents, year alone publish 30 – come. but public focus standard-setting, important forget critical “behind scenes” role information-sharing, since well know regulation cannot successful without strong supervision cooperation back up. the second important influence committee grow sophistication complexity international financial markets. the original basel accord beautiful simplicity – something many people long today – could keep development increasingly complex financial instruments. these may offer substantial benefit society, strain simple basel i methodology. the committee’s response obviously manifest basel ii. this mark another turning-point committee’s evolution, move u “one size fit all” regime differential approach use internal models. this mean regulatory regime good align banks’ underlie risk profile, regulation long simple completely uniform across banks. like change, deliver undoubted benefits, also create whole new range challenge still grapple today. the third key influence committee stem increase globalisation. a creature g10, committee could originally lay claim coverage world’s truly internationally active banks. but bank financial market become increasingly integrate across national borders, claim standard setter internationally active bank become difficult justify. during 1990s 2000s, committee make good use core principle liaison group seek advice member outside g10. the cplg’s contribution highly bi central bankers’ speech 3 constructive basel ii developed, example. but size importance jurisdiction “outside tent” grew, even arrangement become increasingly untenable. and so, 2009, committee essentially step g10 g20 foundation seek truly coordinate response global financial crisis. indeed, 40 organisation represent 27 member jurisdiction around table. a result, committee’s coverage global bank asset go 60% 90%. this much great inclusiveness lends, turn, great legitimacy credibility committee’s standards, set process truly reflective international markets. the fourth key influence recent one – shift think micro- macroprudential perspective. for much life, committee focus primarily microprudential issues. that say macroprudential angle ignored, certainly view – quite prevalent pre-crisis world – bank individually stable, financial system would stay upright. during great moderation, little appetite exist new tool international regulation macroprudential nature, even committee could foresee loom threats. the financial crisis bring home lesson financial stability could assure use microprudential tools. and basel iii represent another important step committee’s development. basel iii substantially enhance microprudential framework. and, countercyclical buffer, also introduce first international agreement macroprudential tool. subsequent work framework systemically important bank (both global domestic) expand committee’s input relatively new field – trend unlikely reversed. my fifth key influence committee’s evolution also quite recent, hence eventual impact committee’s work still difficult foresee: role monitor implementation committee standards. post-crisis, committee expand membership, also take role monitor implementation standard agree members. to outsider, may sound significant – indeed, might reasonably ask committee wasn’t already – notable idea committee previously consider reject one occasion. indeed, authoritative history committee’s early years, charles goodhart note that, far back 1983, discussion whether committee might also monitor practical application agreements. at time, though, see somewhat awkward step far. that committee mandate show commitment consistent international regulation undiminished – indeed, strong ever been. let conclude welcome basel, particularly play role committee’s early year – hope return bring back many good memories. for current committee members, wonderful opportunity learn wisdom grapple issue us. we also hope hear different perspectives, bank industry, academia, challenge opportunity face committee. i therefore look forward productive – hopefully provocative – discussion morning. bi central bankers’ speech 1 carlos da silva costa: portugal’s situation post-troika period address mr carlos da silva costa, governor bank portugal, “portugal post-troika” economist meeting, lisbon, 5 july 2013. * * * thank you, mr. president. in speech, i would like address portugal’s situation post-troika period, start assessment get there, i.e. “the day before”. indeed, situation day conclusion economic financial assistance programme important day after, give condition subsequent developments. i. the day conclusion adjustment programme take account currently available economic projections, use traffic light reference, reach time transition external account indicator exhibit “green” light, economic activity indicator number fiscal indicator “yellow” one unemployment public debt “red” one (table 1). table 1 macroeconomic outlook conclusion economic financial assistance programme note: june 2013 projection sources: imf banco de portugal. 2 bi central bankers’ speech significant adjustment external account (green) the external rebalancing portuguese economy remarkable, quick strong two previous programmes, foreign exchange rate use adjustment instrument. the current capital account good service account – 2012 record positive figure first time decade – remain surplus. this adjustment reflect impact contract domestic demand import increase market share portuguese exports. in fact, particularly adverse international environment, portuguese firm make remarkable effort enhance penetration diversification export markets. mute recovery economic activity continuation process fiscal deficit reduction (yellow) however, dynamic export sufficient sustain economic activity expansion. in fact, economic activity contract initially project current outlook point mute recovery 2014. fiscal adjustment, albeit low initially projected, substantial. the primary fiscal balance, exclude interest expenditure, improve substantially. the adjustment also significant look development structural balance public finances. however, fiscal consolidation process slow expect sustainability must ensure public expenditure-cutting measures. unemployment public debt high still grow (red) the level unemployment clearly cause concern, namely give largely reflect structural unemployment. this situation call implementation safety network safeguard social cohesion, allow re-training long-term unemployed prevent fall inactivity. public debt reach high level still growing. it imperative development ensure sustainable path. this constitute main constraint economic policy future. i would like draw attention one point fundamental importance deserve thorough consideration. a point mr. marco buti’s speech, adjustment programme strictly implemented. this notwithstanding, perception failure arise among portuguese population social political players, namely perception fail meet programme targets. this perception incorrect. therefore, opinion, necessary, important debunk idea, stress that:  first, international economic development much adverse previously expected, negative consequence exports, investment, economic activity and, consequently, fiscal revenue expenditure public debt. a such, way illustration, external demand evolve line initially project programme, effort budgetary adjustment make date would imply government debt ratio would already downward path (the dash line figure 1 below).  second, programme’s projection rely fiscal multiplier ultimately estimate ex post. increase uncertainty among economic agent result continue weakness external environment portuguese economy and, particular, simultaneous fiscal consolidation process way external economies, lead economic agent predict high fall permanent income. a consequence, impact fiscal consolidation measure gdp – multiplier – underestimated. bi central bankers’ speech 3 figure 1 public debt percentage gdp source: banco de portugal. the combination two adverse factor establishment programme’s target percentage gdp make necessary revise targets, pain trigger feed vicious circle fiscal consolidation economic activity developments. this warrant rethink adjustment programmes’ target set-up prevent return effect gdp development compliance budgetary target – tax revenue social spend – debt target – tax revenues, social spend “denominator effect”. my message, mr. buti particular, is: fiscal target future programme set percentage gdp, form limit nominal public expenditure give target control fiscal policymakers and, such, allow actual assessment result achieve consequent accountability failures. still subject day post-troika period, important take account degree financial market access sovereign issuer. if market access restore credible sustain manner time, upon programme’s conclusion, painful process begin. for reason, issuance five ten-year portuguese treasury bonds, january may respectively, key milestones. they crucial gauge market’s “temperature” set progressive credibility enhance portuguese government debt. it recall that, even balance public accounts, continue depend financial markets, give substantial need pay exist public debt (figures 2 3). this mean still need financial market will refinance debt. to end, investor must feel comfortable public debt level, development path consistency credibility fiscal process. to sum up, creditor must feel that: debt sustainable, fiscal policy accommodate respective servicing, reduction consistent medium run political player ensure compliance result liabilities. give state public finances, leverage available u restrict pace public debt adjustment. 4 bi central bankers’ speech figure 2 public debt – maturity profile source: banco de portugal. figure 3 medium long-term debt annual repayment schedule (after extension efsf efsm loans) source: igcp (portuguese treasury debt management agency). by way illustration, note that, assume long-term growth rate nominal gdp around 3 per cent, compliance budgetary target set programme 2013–2014 fiscal compact commitment thereafter (in particular, structural adjustment primary balance least 0.5 p.p. per year) would make possible u reach government debt-to-gdp ratio approximately 60 per cent around 2030 (figure 4). this mean that, scenario return economic growth, compliance medium-term commitment fiscal compact would imply sustainability path medium long run portuguese public debt. bi central bankers’ speech 5 figure 4 public debt percentage gdp note: assumption scenario: (i) fulfilment programme target 2013 2014; (ii) increase structural primary balance 0.5% gdp per year 2020, reach mto; (iii) consolidation effort exclusively expenditure side; (iv) increase implicit interest rate public debt 4.4% 2020 (3.9% 2012). source: banco de portugal. this exercise correspond aggressive adjustment profile term public debt reduction. my preference go smooth debt adjustment path, compatible parallel decline tax burden. figure 5 show scenario gradual reduction tax burden time result freeze nominal expenditure, background strict compliance fiscal commitments. this scenario would result slow reduction public debt, albeit sustainable path, would advantage allow tax burden reduction. it common knowledge i advocate “bonus” result economic growth divide public debt cut tax cuts. debt reduction key enhance credibility financial market and, accordingly, ensure refinancing. in turn, tax burden reduction fundamental unlock growth potential absorb structural unemployment portugal. it would useful could arrive broad political consensus, tandem broad consensus among social partners, whereby would accept future economic growth bonus use reduce public debt taxes. to end, one option would reach compromise maintain nominal public expenditure constant level 2015 onwards, correspond decline real term equivalent inflation rate time. 6 bi central bankers’ speech figure 5 public debt percentage gdp note: assumption underlie scenario: (i) fulfilment programme target 2013 2014; (ii) stabilisation nominal expenditure 2015 onwards; (iii) gradual decline direct tax throughout horizon; (iv) increase structural primary balance 0.5% gdp per year 2020, reach mto; (v) consolidation effort exclusively expenditure side; (vi) increase implicit interest rate public debt 4.4% 2020 (3.9% 2012). source: banco de portugal. ii. the post-troika period the challenge lie ahead conclusion economic financial assistance programme small face course programme. more specifically, must able answer follow questions: how ensure return financial market reversed? how ensure sustain balance economic growth portuguese economy within euro area? a mention president mr. buti, answer question certain condition must fulfil domestic external level (figure 6). at domestic level, short run, adjustment process portuguese economy must go forward. this means, inter alia, proceed consolidation public accounts, improve bank system profitability, push household corporate balance sheet adjustment, create social security network long-term unemployed set condition induce potential output growth portugal. bi central bankers’ speech 7 figure 6 condition successful exit programme look ahead, new institutional framework must established, basis broad consensus, foster behaviour consistent maintenance fundamental macroeconomic balance economy’s competitive capacity. in context, first point mind social cohesion. the ongoing sectoral shift portuguese economy suggest unemployment rate remain high protract period time. safeguard social cohesion key manage unemployment line structural nature. in fact, mechanical exercise conduct banco de portugal show 8 per cent annual growth external demand 2020 would cumulative reduce impact 7 p.p. unemployment rate (to around 11 per cent), mean solution unemployment problem lie demand side. we must able free generate entrepreneurial skills, attract foreign direct investment boost productive sector. at time, must create support scheme re-train long-term unemployed view increase employability. in addition social cohesion, two condition i find important. the first creation political consensus portuguese economic policy leeway. this political consensus “unanimity”, is, rather, acknowledgment economic policy limit curtailment political discussion limit result external finance constraint public indebtedness. the second condition consensus among social partners. we must enhance dialogue social partners, ensure realistic negotiation distribution income, i.e. take account productivity gain economy. we draw inspiration experience country like belgium finland. these country place system that, case risk competitiveness, subordinate wage settlement imperative safeguard competitiveness employment. at time, external condition supportive adjustment must put place. these external condition depend solidarity european partners, 8 bi central bankers’ speech accomplish prove sense responsibility ability comply commitments. the keyword whole process “trust”. set above-mentioned domestic condition important strengthen partners’ confidence fulfilment obligation time win solidarity. a regard short-term external condition successful exit adjustment programme, i consider crucial european mechanism place address incidental factors. to deal excess volatility financial market and, consequently, prevent investor move away portuguese debt, european intervention mechanism primary secondary portuguese debt market must place, which, turn, entail adoption precautionary programme. the precautionary programme help enhance credibility macroeconomic adjustment process period immediately conclusion programme. the associate conditionality is, one hand, counterpart european partners’ solidarity and, hand, key element consolidate market confidence country’s economic policies. turn medium-term conditions, crucial european union implement mechanism economy policy coordination establish process cooperative european growth. in context, european country favourable economic situation make use leverage available expand domestic demand, contribute balance sustainable adjustment whole economy. the establishment bank union central pillar fix financial fragmentation euro area break link sovereign risk bank risk. this important step towards enhance competitiveness, give make possible identical firm term profitability risk similar finance conditions, regardless geographical location. moreover, structural reform implement induce potential output growth across europe (e.g. output market deregulation tax system reforms). in sum:  for successful adjustment portuguese economy ensure prosperity within monetary union, certain domestic external condition must established. by prove domestic condition place, external condition ensue strengthened.  in term domestic conditions, social cohesion must ensure consensus among social partners, well broad consensus political players, must reached.  the necessary political consensus concern policy implement limit constraint definition implementation (as i say occasions, although may different opinion decorate live room, must admit live room wall limit constraint; term economic policy, wall exercise correspond external constraint place give country). thank much. bi central bankers’ speech 1 patrick honohan: the problem mortgage arrears ireland introductory statement mr patrick honohan, governor central bank ireland, oireachtas (national parliament) joint committee finance, public expenditure reform, dublin, 25 september 2013. * * * i thank committee invite come speak problem mortgage arrears, indeed i also course welcome opportunity explain central bank’s policy matter committee may wish raise. i previously discuss committee extremely slow progress make bank arrest growth arrears, process case fall arrears implement sustainable solutions. thing still move quickly central bank would prefer; indication process working, momentum building, way go. what goal central bank address problem mortgage arrears? the central bank’s approach drive main regulatory objectives, prudential consumer. the consumer protection goal – fair reasonable treatment – target through, example, code conduct mortgage arrears (ccma). the mortgage arrears target craft use prudential powers, though also side-benefit consumer. figure exactly achieve important policy goal work within constitutional, legal practical reality present novel challenge central bank. while progress still slow, i satisfy approach correct progressively yield results. it almost two year since central bank launch mortgage arrears resolution strategy steadily ramp requirement bank improve policies, process staff around issue order accelerate result ground. in march year, part process, view enhance measurability progress, central bank introduce regime quantitative target ensure sustainable solution find quickly distress mortgages. the bank report compliance first quarterly set targets, central bank start process audit sample case see whether solution propose bank truly regard sustainable. the internal guideline audit carry finalize post central bank’s website. (they website draft form past three months). what sustainability? in nutshell, sustainable arrangement one affordable borrower short long term, provide sufficient clarity happen collateral maturity. the guideline seek put sufficient flesh concept allow criterion audited, restrictive prevent innovation solution design. why initiation legal proceed big part exercise? the march 2013 target document set three mode generate sustainable solution. • the first, preferred, type solution arrangement payment re-established original, agree revise schedule. • the second mode borrower opt personal insolvency arrangement pia. this yet available borrower end-june. • the third mode, available bank arrangement could reach appropriate, involve surrender repossession property. 2 bi central bankers’ speech although bank report compliance target end-june 2013, notable, though perhaps surprising, 60 per cent initial wave follow third mode. why bank rely heavily initiate legal proceed first wave action mortgage arrears resolution target (mart) scheme? subject verification audit process, possible case involve protract period arrears limit cooperation borrower notably provide information need lender arrive good solution. up-to-date borrower information provide lender essential lender design good sustainable solution potentially involve repossession. neither lender central bank expect repossession prefer solution end cases. in cases, engagement borrower make legal course unnecessary. if so, always best course action borrower start engage provide necessary information bank find good course available. the central bank’s ccma provide strong protection framework borrower engage lenders. under ccma lender require proactively engage customer order help address situation, must carry full assessment borrower’s situation base standard financial statement case must examine individual merits. lender require explore option offer alternative repayment arrangement must inform borrower reason alternative available. the ccma provide lender may commence legal proceed repossession already make every reasonable effort agree alternative arrangement. clearly, though, central bank mandate prevent lender proceed repossession borrower refuse engage, despite lender follow procedure mandate ccma. any bank proceed lightly legal recourse cooperate borrower without satisfy procedure ccma, alternative sustainable arrangement available, evidently act manner consistent target regime. this detect audit corrective action required. bi central bankers’ speech 3 how come household debt become big problem? that household mortgage debt would represent big potential source loan loss developer loan evident early stage crisis. it also clear problem would emerge once, would grow distress borrower run save (to extent unemployment problem) find difficult expect secure new job. but ultimate scale problem hard predict expect bank persistently ineffective get arm around problem deliver sustainable solutions. the best available sustainable solution take several forms. some merely involve identify default justifiable give household resources: borrower need bring back track. others, especially buy-to-lets, may involve surrender property bank assist sale, sustainable treatment shortfall. in cases, lender cannot confident recover loan, protect risk forgive need device split mortgage. other scheme possible. none arrangement ideal: generally imply great disappointment borrower loss lender relative originally envisaged. debt forgiveness the central bank empowered, could be, insist debt forgiveness particular borrower. relief insolvent borrower indebtedness determine ultimately insolvency procedure legislation recently reform direction rightly much favourable insolvent debtor previous legislation. the central bank help advise draft legislation supportive aims. use legislation important mean ensure over-indebtedness problems, especially involve multiple debtors, resolved. but possible lender avoid impose cost delay personal insolvency arrangement (pia) bankruptcy many insolvent debtors, come sustainable negotiate solution good borrower lender. be split mortgage central bank’s prefer outcome? various type solution possible deal situation initial repayment promise look unsustainable. if appropriately design – criterion set sustainability guideline – split mortgage sustainable solution, depend borrower’s circumstances. it allow lender take explicit account future improvement borrower’s circumstances, provide borrower sufficient assurance affordability future. but provide one several possible approaches. bank begin experiment model give borrower assurance repayment go back firm basis. the committee mention approach outline ulster bank, face approach seem ingredient need consider sustainable. while central bank set sustainability guidelines, nobody, least borrowers, would serve central bank attempt place narrow straitjacket prevent innovation around possible solution within guidelines. bank begin learn experience element differentiate ineffective engagement arrears customers, kind engagement lead arrangement sustainable, fact sustain match borrower’s ability motivations. some bank go successfully road others. should bank achieve sustainability? despite efforts, despite real progress policies, process staffing, far many arrears case still remain untreated, whether sustainably not. for example, 4 bi central bankers’ speech 98,000 personal dwell home (pdh) account 90 day arrears end june, fully 74,000 – three every four – yet arrangement. why bank slow acting? it may be, many suggested, delay correct legislative defect identify dunne judgement represent delay – though deter non-repossession action. the moratorium, ccma restriction design prevent harassment debt collectors, likely contribute delay, also use excuses. in event, moratorium ccma rule streamline way retain sufficient protection distress borrower – legitimate important objective – generate little obstacle efficiently organise collection procedures. the legislative defect identify dunne judgement also eventually corrected, recommend central bank. more important fact task require much focus effective organisational effort scale bank first realized, deficiency progressively overcoming, since start audit critique procedure intensively 2011. i believe also gap analysis central bank bank regard need clarity predictability solution proposed. the central bank want sure sufficient clarity arrangement, example regard treatment borrower’s liability shortfall loan follow assist sale repossession, warehouse part split mortgage. some bank express opinion degree uncertainty element treat could help ensure bank recover much possible. the central bank belief contrary that, widespread systemic problem debtor distress, great clarity residually owe circumstance safe lender guard erosion debt service culture, well help broad restoration household confidence help wide economic recovery boost loan recoverability. in particular, central bank regard unwise creation situation where, uncertainty, lender borrower hold inconsistent expectation enforce recover particular loan. finally degree wishful thinking, belief many case cure even without energetic action lenders. leave well enough alone not, however, adequate approach. delay worsen prospect lender borrower. this truism act upon expeditiously. the central bank executive management control banks’ operation – remain responsibility board director bank get work properly all. but central bank use power utmost extent overcome delays. the process working; still slow, momentum building. bi central bankers’ speech 1 william c dudley: brief remark centennial “the

york fed, remarkable place within extraordinary system. first, bank within government. that mean researchers, supervisor market analysts, also provide bank service posse significant operational capabilities. we accept deposits, make loan operate system open market account federal open market committee. when exigent unusual circumstance require extraordinary operations, financial crisis implement 2 bi central bankers’ speech unconventional monetary policies, stand ready. our operational capability complement conventional central bank policy role way is, i think, special within

financial crisis, play critical role within system prevent financial panic turn world-wide depression. we continue display spirit every day bank. and attitude, ability esprit de corp doubt allow u system meet important challenge road ahead. i focus briefly challenges: the first monetary policy front. the federal reserve engage set unconventional monetary policy recent years. these policy necessary fomc could ease monetary policy conventional mean – federal fund rate constrain so-called “zero low bound”. exit unconventional set policy certainly feasible – ability pay interest excess reserve give u viable tool manage monetary policy even enlarge balance sheet, new york feed prepare execute mission, always are. but bite humble don’t know. there undoubtedly communication operational challenge unexpected consequences. we need sufficiently agile best achieve dual mandate maximum sustainable employment context price stability. the second challenge u new york fed, within regulatory community generally, stay course implement regulatory regime institution “too big fail” (tbtf). tbtf wrong several reasons. it create unfair disparity large small institutions. in addition unfair, create great risk financial stability encourage great size complexity. we make considerable progress toward end tbtf – raise capital liquidity requirement largest, systemic bank – way go. in particular, paraphrase former new york feed president tim geithner, single point entry concept “beats plan”, significant barrier achieve cross border resolution remain, still insufficient incentive place firm take corrective action early prevent failure first place. the third challenge federal reserve put financial stability par monetary policy. a experience 2007 2009 demonstrated, monetary policy cannot work properly financial instability. when financial instability occurs, disturb market function impair bank balance sheet way disrupt financial intermediation function, constrain availability credit household businesses. this, turn, lead reduction aggregate demand put additional stress bi central bankers’ speech 3 weaken financial system. financial stability cannot subordinate priority. the fourth challenge sustain enhance capability new york fed. this start obviously continue attract, develop retain best people. but also extend tend so-called culture institution – example, ensure good idea rise top matter originate, people feel comfortable challenge conventional wisdom. these challenge energizing, that’s president new york feed great job world. and i confident that,

clear. i refer case unethical behavior banker emerge wake crisis. where thing start go wrong? what possible remedies? and role dnb prudential supervisor? these topic i would like focus today. let start give example unethical behavior banker crisis. just week ago, former goldman sachs banker – fabrice tourré – find guilty fraud jury new york city. mr tourré hold responsible seriously misguide client so-called “abacus deal”. abacus 2007 name investment residential mortgagebacked securities, product yield income mortgage payment homeowners. the deal follows: goldman sachs sell product, intermediary company arrange deal, paulson & co., go “short” deal. that is, buy product would bring vast amount money mortgage default. to make sure setup would work, mortgage select abacus investment high chance defaulting. of course, client goldman sachs paulson & co sell product keep dark this. in words, tourré paulson seek maximize profit expense clients. it therefore hardly surprise scheme, transpired, lead significant loss trust financial sector general. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this example illustrate bank engage unethical behaviour deliberately misguide clients, bet them. let u take close look bank business general: could thing go wrong way did? a bank intermediary people money want spend, people would like borrow money. put briefly, bank’s business earn money money. in culture tradition consider inherently immoral. in society, find perfectly acceptable, even consider indispensable economy function properly. the past year clearly shown, however, thing go amiss. a former chief economist imf, raghuram rajan, put it: “because [bankers’] business typically offer pillar anchor morality, primary compass become much money make” (rajan 2010: 126). the question, then, “in whose interest bank working?” before, say, year 2000, bank use focus interest clients, employees, shareholders. in words, focus interest stakeholders. but early year present millennium, focus come rest interest shareholder alone. “managing value” become new creed. a i see it, approach make imbalance bankers’ decision-making. it come stand way bank ought operate, create problem party involved, banker included. let explain “managing value” lead imbalanced decision-making. “managing value” foster short-term instrumental thinking. client become instrument extract money order maximize profit thus increase shareholder value. employee hire basis capacity make much money possible fast possible, rather capacity make sustainable contribution bank. bank board cut staffing, launch new strategies, sometimes yearly; order gain hold shareholders’ attention; bank’s best interest client employees. so, one might say focus “managing value” only, bank lose track require maintain right balance. bank play crucial role economy. a role go beyond maximize profit shareholders. bank intermediaries: people deposit save bank, bank provide credit need money. this bank’s chief task, main role economic system society. it bank’s societal responsibility. just like company – shell, kpn, akzo nobel – bank, too, specific role play. a bank strive perform role properly, balance way, order hold trust customer potential customers. this trust erode bank fail mechanism place prevent excess saw year 2008 crisis. and serious loss trust evident, day still work hard restore trust financial sector. let u turn possible remedy gap banker rest society; gap partially create unethical behavior display bankers.the first possible remedy criticize banker severely persistently. this remedy apply recent years, banker “bashed” quite severely past years; many case right reasons. bi central bankers’ speech 3 but, feel bash continue bank errors, let’s forget cannot without banks. they provide service vital function modern economy. also, let u bear mind ongoing criticism may negative side-effect. a anthropologist joris luyendijk – observe banker london’s financial district – point out: instead subject self-criticism, banker tend grow indifferent public’s view. some even go far argue “clearly must do something right, many people seem jealous success”. rather change ways, banker tend wait crisis criticism blow over. perhaps, hope economy pick again, everyone forgive forget errors. to quote rajan more: severely criticize “the immorality banker make good rhetoric politics throughout history, unlikely address fundamental reason much harm”. so, bash solution, close “gap” society bankers? surely, charm offensive bank wouldn’t trick. any course would futile, since many people distrust deeply that. and “actions speak loud words” anyway. i therefore think best way banker may instead quietly properly job, society would want to. or solve problem establish “ethics office” every bank, sometimes suggested? of course, attention see day ethical dilemma laudable. but risk dedicate ethic office rest organization may come think long need worry head ethics. if effect, ethic office would even counterproductive. for instead make organization whole ethical, would prompt “box-ticking” attitude. therefore, rather focus establish ethic office “second line defense”, focus ethic “first line defense”: banker themselves. another option would impose rule financial sector. of course, extra regulation introduce necessary. for instance, basel iii rule provide capital ratio raised. yet, opinion, extra rule cannot solve problems. for every new rule lead creative solution evade rule. by make new rules, won’t make banker le greedy, make ethical. instead overregulating every detail, focus decision banker make. this point – decision make – deserve discuss great detail. a bank govern board director senior management. these officer decide bank’s strategy key targets. their decision far-reaching consequence bank’s operations, example “managing value” demonstrates: misguide decision may undesirable effects. this considered, i would like focus way banker make decisions. the classical virtue “prudentia” – modern english, “prudence” – help u here. prudentia virtue stand “making careful decisions”. it require capacity reflection, careful analysis, balance judgment. this sound like goal worth strive for, mean bank practice? in bank practice, mean that, instead focus one interest particular, banker balance stakeholders’ interests. they neither focus shareholder alone, specific category clients. banker practice prudence take societal responsibility heart, is: trustworthy intermediary. 4 bi central bankers’ speech therefore, “prudent” decision-makers, banker should: • scan interest stake, • balance different interest involved, • reflect consequence actions, • show “moderately risk-prone”. by make careful balance decisions, reflect societal responsibility, banker regain trust need function optimally. what dnb prudential supervisor improve “prudence” bankers? in recent years, focus heavily good corporate governance, expand supervisory scope include business models, behavior culture. by look closely business models, want increase understand bank actually make money become good able discern high-risk strategies. in supervision behavior culture, aim make banks’ senior management capable careful decision-makers. let give two examples. first, “fit proper” test aspire board member become thorough. we add requirement as: • sensitive external developments; • able take balance decisions; • take responsibility outcomes. we do want bank competent decision-makers boards. second, supervision governance also cover board effectiveness. we measure aspect observe behaviour board member meetings. we analyze performance, reflect way operate, ask challenge question like: • be chairman dominant? • be board really “in control”? • how board communicate? • be room differ point view? • through new developments, aim foster prudent decision-making stimulate reflection. lady gentlemen, i’m go summarize main point speech. i’ve approach theme gathering, “ethics crisis financial sector”, perspective executive director responsible prudential supervision. i’ve make case bank restore confidence essential build block healthy economy. the remedy current confidence crisis neither lie bash bankers, charm offensive, establish ethic offices, even impose rules. banker need become prudent decision-makers again. this restore balance require function optimally. bi central bankers’ speech 5 this i look issue. i’m aware others may hold different view happy answer question panel session. finally, i wish student faculty member gather good luck new academic year hope see back de nederlandsche bank one day, career take maybe hadn’t expect go. ;) thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 lawrence schembri: bear necessity build succeed – canada world need financial stability board remark mr lawrence schembri, deputy governor bank canada, cfa society (ottawa), ottawa, ontario, 24 september 2013. * * * introduction it five year since bad day global financial crisis, begin dramatic collapse lehman brother september 2008. while subsequent great recession officially end june 2009, hardly seem over, give slow-motion recovery global economy. this especially case europe unite states, employment yet return pre-crisis levels. look back canada’s experience past five years, key lesson crisis keep house order enough shelter u global financial storms. yes, canada’s recovery strong virtually advance economies, thank part resilient financial system. our sound monetary, fiscal financial sector policy protect u bad financial crisis recession. but make mistake: canada still hit hard. output fell 3.5 per cent. and october 2008 october 2009, unemployment rate rise 6.1 per cent 8.3 per cent. hard lesson learn international level. the breadth depth crisis, speed travel around globe, make world leader sit take notice. in 2009, g-20 identify important task reduce likelihood future financial crisis limit spillover across borders. the financial stability board (fsb) set coordinate work.1 today, i go talk fsb, especially coordinate role canada global economy. i focus on: • fsb needed, • works, • accomplishment date plan future. i also discus implication fsb’s financial reform agenda canada. why need fsb from perspective, fsb unique international organization certain quality many associate canadians, quality i believe help ensure success make global financial system resilient. a resilient global financial system end itself, necessary foundation strong, sustainable balance global economic growth, lead high employment improve live standards. the fsb bear necessity aftermath financial crisis. it raison d’être stem one overarch fact: global financial system highly integrated.2 financial institution market interconnect interdependent within across various 1 the fsb grow financial stability forum (fsf), found 1999 g-7 wake financial crisis asia, latin america russia. 2 bank canada deputy governor timothy lane, 2013 speech, “financial stability one country?” argue global financial integration, impossible achieve financial stability one jurisdiction focus exclusively domestic considerations. 2 bi central bankers’ speech sectors, include banking, insurance, pension investment funds, and, increasingly, across national jurisdictions. thus, achieve comprehensive coherent approach financial regulation oversight necessary attain global public good financial stability, coordination essential across countries, across element reforms, across many different regulator supervisors. failure coordinate would lead fragmentation financial system, would impede global recovery. this need effective coordination g-20 establish fsb 2009.3 what fsb? the fsb newest, far small – 25 full-time staff – probably least well know major international organizations.4 these include postwar heavyweight international monetary fund (imf), world bank organisation economic co-operation development (oecd). it international organization like other: • it membership compose national financial authority 24 countries, include g-20 member significant financial jurisdiction switzerland singapore.5 an important innovation also include international financial institution imf, world bank bank international settlements, well international body set standard banking, insurance, security accounting.6 • the fsb punch well weight lever knowledge 70 member agencies, home several thousand financial sector experts. it expert heavy lifting, sit committee work group develop policy conduct peer review implementation, support small fsb secretariat. • at fsb, decision make base consensus. the process policy development allow member input view stage, thereby ensure collective ownership policy decisions. the fsb rely moral suasion, political scientist like call “soft power.” a such, fsb wield legal sanction encourage country adhere global standard promote “race top” disclosure peer pressure. the fsb member standard-setting body regularly produce peer-led, country-by-country assessment compliance global standards. 3 the fsb charter affirm “the fsb’s role coordinate international level work national financial authority international standard set body develop promote implementation effective regulatory, supervisory financial sector policy interest global financial stability”. see: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_120809.pdf. 4 the majority fsb staff member temporary secondment member institutions. 5 in addition 70 member agency 24 member countries, fsb six regional consultative group disseminate information collect feedback additional 70 non-member countries. broad implementation global financial standard important support ongoing process global financial economic integration. 6 these standard-setting body include basel committee bank supervision (bcbs), international association insurance supervisor (iais), international organization security commission (iosco), committee payment settlement system (cpss), international account standard board (iasb). bi central bankers’ speech 3 • because fsb creation g-20 leaders, weight g-20 behind it. the g-20 provide direction receive regular progress update fsb financial reform agenda. this close work relationship give fsb political leverage need effective. in short, fsb design succeed coordinate role. it efficient inclusive international organization act nimbly coordinate effort need address serious financial vulnerabilities.7 the fsb may small, powerful, undertake work great significance create resilient, competitive integrate global financial system, necessary support rapidly evolve global economy. country canada, open global financial market internationally active financial institutions, especially benefit work fsb. a i mention earlier, fsb also embody characteristic important canadians. it consultative, guide common sense consensus; co-operative; respectful process. this perhaps surprising, give senior official bank canada office superintendent financial institution (osfi) play prominent leadership role fsb.8 how fsb work? the fsb work achieve goal global financial stability four main functions, steps, i call financial policy cycle: i. identify ass financial vulnerabilities. the recent financial crisis pinpoint several, i discus moment. ii. develop necessary policy global standard address vulnerabilities. iii. monitor implementation standard national jurisdiction ensure consistency; iv. ass effectiveness regulation, include unintended adverse consequence financial market outcomes. the fsb organize around four functions, stand committee fsb member carry necessary work.9 7 work bcbs, fsb able use soft-power approach, include political leverage g-20, get new basel iii capital framework develop largely put place five years. in contrast, take almost twice long reach stage early capital framework. 8 former bank canada governor current bank england governor mark carney serve fsb chair since november 2011; senior deputy governor tiff macklem chair fsb’s stand committee standard implementation june 2009 april 2013; julie dickson, superintendent osfi, chair fsb’s committee supervisory intensity effectiveness since creation 2010. see m. carney, “rebuilding trust global banking” (speech 7th annual thomas d’aquino lecture leadership, london, ontario, 25 february 2013); j. dickson, remark institute internal auditors, toronto, 31 may 2013, remark international institute finance, madrid, 21 may 2012; t. macklem, “raising house reform” (speech rotman institute international business, toronto, 7 february 2012). 9 the stand committee assessment vulnerability (scav) conduct regular monitor exercise identify ass vulnerabilities; stand committee supervisory regulatory cooperation (src) decide best address vulnerability policy development; stand committee standard implementation (scsi) monitor implementation ass effectiveness. the work committee direct oversee steer committee plenary, fsb’s decision-making body. 4 bi central bankers’ speech let illustrate execution first two step policy cycle outline four principal weakness global financial system expose financial crisis fsb responded. (i) inadequately capitalize bank in 2008, major bank unite states, unite kingdom continental europe either fail publicly rescued, large part insufficient level good-quality capital absorb loss incur take much credit risk. build resilient bank to address weakness build resilient banks, basel committee bank supervision, fsb member, develop basel iii rule strengthen quantity quality bank capital. these rule call triple require amount capital.10 this update basel framework buttress enhance liquidity rules, backstop leverage ratio similar one use canada, countercyclical capital buff strong supervision enforce adoption banks. (ii) financial institution consider “too big fail” large financial institutions, like lehman brother aig, able take excessive risk see “too big fail.” consequently, risk realized, actual loom failure institution weaken investor confidence, spread uncertainty severely disrupt global financial system. to stem massive contagion, many institution bail taxpayers’ expense, patently unfair. loss socialized; bear profit take risk. end “too big fail” to end “too big fail,” fsb adopt three-pronged approach, know systemically important financial institution (sifi) framework. the three key element development are: • high capital requirement financial institution deem systemically important;11 • standard effective resolution institution eliminate need taxpayer bailouts minimize disruption financial system; and12 • intense effective supervisory oversight. (iii) shadow bank credit intermediation activity outside perimeter traditional regulation often refer “shadow banking.” i prefer call “market-based finance” include securitization, repurchase agreement (repos) money market funds, 10 the minimum requirement common equity increase 2 per cent 4.5 per cent, rise 7 per cent new capital conservation buff added. 11 in 2011, fsb identify initial group global systemically important financial institution (g-sifis). the current group 28 global systemically important bank (g-sibs) update november 2013. the fsb standard-setting body extend sifi framework domestic systemically important bank (d-sibs). national authority begin apply phase-in arrangement requirement d-sibs january 2016. see: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_121031ac.pdf. an initial list global systemically important insurer publish july 2013. 12 in 2011, fsb publish “key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions”, set authority could resolve financial institution orderly manner. bi central bankers’ speech 5 important useful form credit intermediation. if properly regulated, however, activity subject sort systemic risk banks, include contagious runs. the bad example crisis faulty securitization u.s. subprime mortgages. transform shadow bank resilient market-based finance a measure put place make bank resilient, legitimate concern great scrutiny regulation traditional bank sector could result risky activity migrate beyond regulatory perimeter shadow bank sector. first, part ongoing work vulnerability assessment, fsb establish framework monitor shadow bank identify evaluate emerge risks. second, part effort ensure shadow bank transform resilient market-based finance, fsb, g-20 meet st. petersburg early month, present set recommendation regulation shadow banking. these recommendation aim increase transparency, reduce moral hazard limit maturity liquidity transformation, overall goal strike balance efficiency competition activity offer bank-like risk pose. (iv) critical financial market seize an important example financial market seize us$600 trillion over-the-counter (otc) derivative market, critical source fund risk management, especially major financial institutions. while otc derivative market underlie cause financial crisis, complexity, opacity interconnectedness make crisis worse. create robust continuous otc derivative market to increase transparency reduce systemic risk markets, fsb coordinate development policy ensure transaction report trade repository standardize otc derivative clear central counterparties, ccps. a central counterparty act buyer every seller seller every buyer financial transaction clears. this increase transparency reduce counterparty credit risk.13 next step: implementation the third step fsb’s policy cycle implementation global policy standard national level. this difficult time-consuming step mean take global minimum standard principle financial sector regulation adapt local implementation. this rubber hit road. the state goal fsb “full, timely consistent” implementation global standard national level. each adjective essential: underscore importance coherent comprehensive approach regulation create level regulatory play field across jurisdictions. the fsb member agency develop multi-year framework monitor implementation reforms. implementation national level typically require several steps, include revise exist law pass new legislation, develop rule guideline market 13 central counterparties concentrate mutualize risk don’t eliminate it. thus, need stringent standard risk management oversight. 6 bi central bankers’ speech participants. consistency difficult achieve jurisdiction different legal institutional framework must modify meet new global standards. where canada implementation process? because canada’s regulatory supervisory framework relatively well develop go crisis, extent reform need le profound, still important. nonetheless, canada lead example. it one first jurisdiction implement basel iii capital framework.14 at begin year, major canadian bank expect meet stringent basel iii requirement specify osfi – six year ahead agree deadline 1 january 2019.15 canada also make progress address problem big fail. osfi recently designate canada’s six large bank domestic systemically important bank require hold 1 per cent capital closely supervised.16 market-based finance generally view le vulnerable canada jurisdictions, bank canada partner agency want keep way. to end, participate fully fsb’s shadow bank monitor exercise work together consider best implement recent fsb recommendations.17,18 finally, move forward implementation g-20 commitment otc derivatives. in fact, bank canada join multilateral arrangement co-operative oversight lch.clearnet’s swapclear, global central counterparty base london, england, dominant counterparty clear canadian interest rate swaps.19 a i noted, bank work closely agency federal provincial level implement new global standard within framework best suit canada. 14 since end 2007, major canadian bank increase common equity capital 70 per cent, $67 billion. 15 the capital level canada’s major bank roughly 9 per cent higher. canadian bank also move ahead implement recommendation fsb-sponsored, private-sector-led enhance disclosure task force. this task force provide principle recommendation improve bank risk disclosure investor others timely useful information risk undertake banks. this report available at: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/press/pr_121029.pdf. 16 the recent federal budget propose bank would subject system bail-in debt could use recapitalize capital level fall level non-viability. this proposal represent important step implement fsb’s “key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions”. 17 t. gravelle, t. grieder s. lavoie, “monitoring assess risk canada’s shadow bank sector”, bank canada financial system review (june 2013): 55?63. 18 canada go beyond shadow bank recommendation establish promote use central counterparty repurchase agreement reduce counterparty overall systemic risk use collateral efficiently net exposures. 19 a 2 april 2013, bank canada act payment clear settlement act designate swapclear systemically important. designation bring system formal oversight bank canada. it also provide system’s clear settlement rule legal protection canadian law, include pertain netting, finality payment finality settlement. see http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2013/03/publications/press-releases/bank-canada-designates-swapclear-payment-clearing/. bi central bankers’ speech 7 close remark – maintain momentum a dark day global financial crisis slowly fade collective memory, real challenge maintain momentum reform, and, particular, confront difficult cross-border issues, especially respect resolve international financial institution regulate global financial markets. the groundwork there. the fsb foster necessary co-operation make solid progress coordinate development appropriate global policy address main weakness expose crisis. it also push forward directions, include reform financial benchmarks, like libor, improve data collection information exchange, achieve common global set high-quality account standards. the g-20 leader recognize importance fsb’s work last year, los cabos summit, take step strengthen fsb’s role coordinate development implementation financial reforms.20 at recent g-20 summit, leader affirm fsb-led financial reform agenda. nonetheless, argue that, give weak recovery, time broad financial sector reform promote fsb. that argument wrong-headed several reasons. first, financial stability important precondition economic growth. in particular, country strong financial system first recover. indeed, experience unite state important example. u.s. official take bold measure stress test recapitalize bank system. now, reap benefit recovery unite state gather momentum. second, overall coherence reforms, proportionality relative risk macroeconomic effect consider reform finalize implemented.21 third, concern possible adverse effect reform financial system and, particular, market functioning, address fourth step fsb policy cycle. the fsb regularly closely monitor effectiveness new regulations, keep eye material unintended consequences. a know well, global economy and, particular, global financial system, highly integrated. canada learn lesson recent financial crisis, adverse shock spread rapidly financial channels. we also know pace global financial economic integration continue unabated. thus, ensure resilience global financial system and, ultimately, global economy, need global organization coordinate necessary efforts, especially across borders, tackle emerge gap weakness financial regulation supervision thereby help prevent future crisis like one experienced. for fsb – post-financial-crisis institution post-financial-crisis world. thank much. 20 the g-20 leader agree fsb’s mandate strengthened; give permanent legal standing; capacity resource increased. 21 21. see “assessing macroeconomic impact transition strong capital liquidity requirements”, bank international settlements, december 2010; “assessment macroeconomic impact high loss

prime minister albania, honourable guest university oxford, dear representative diplomatic corp academia, dear participants, i pleasure honour open joint conference bank albania university oxford, strengthen linkage economy region. three year ago, september 2010, invite university oxford support academic discussion bank albania economic growth model regional character. at moment, debate misinterpret discussion advantage market economy alternative philosophy economic organisation society. nonetheless, three years, find economic growth model become main topic academic, economic political debate. for number years, economy grip global crisis, reflect mainly decelerate economic activity. consequently, investment lend economy slow down, deteriorating, time, private public sector balances. in spite developments, albanian economy manage maintain price stability overall macroeconomic financial balances. the albanian financial system prove highly immune. despite economic growth slowdown, overall, system remain liquid, well capitalise profitable, reflect prudent work bank albania pre-crisis years. bank albania’s prudent policy reaction bank sector enable system avoid extreme problems, would require use public funds. we bear mind various bank group eu countries, heavily hit crisis, operate albania. the stability bank sector heart work bank albania, focus financial stability bank supervision, monetary policy liquidity management. the bank albania proactive anticipate problems, align role policy global development domestic market state affairs. the dim global financial economic situation dictate need redefine role institutions, include central bank. presently, central bank turn macroprudential measures, traditional mechanism monetary policy transmission suffer burden balance sheet private public economic agents. to good coordinate role monitor economy, central bank around world support monetary policy necessary macroprudential measures. these global development find bank albania well prepare equip require experience. it structure similar one adopt european central bank central bank develop countries. moreover, bank albania several year successful experience employ countercyclical measure manage country’s macroeconomic financial equilibrium. 2 bi central bankers’ speech i would like underscore change risk coefficient control expansion lend foreign currency, introduction limit credit collateral ratio control size debt economy…. mention few. one important lesson global crisis address monetary stability (i.e. price stability) financial stability issue independently provide optimal solution crisis-prone. the economy function complex mechanism often fragile interdependent equilibria, respect boundary institutional responsibilities. for economy, one interest rate, one critical mass financial intermediation fragile equilibrium financial sector balance guarantee sustainable long-term development country. harmonise three objective prerequisite maintain financial equilibrium economy. therefore, identification harmonisation one roof consider optimum solution guarantee country’s economic financial stability. for reason, one pursue

participants, unquestionably, long term, economic growth country determine labour force qualification, productivity, technology innovation capacities; well capital accumulation scale, itself, reflect social preference fiscal stimulus development level financial system. these three set factor condition economic structure country encourage stimulate structural reforms. again, long term, economic growth determine structural reform degree competitiveness economy vis-à-vis trade partner global market. on hand, duty fiscal monetary policy avoid short-term deviation economy long-term trend create sustainable environment country’s economic financial development. the albanian economy already start journey towards integration european union. the ultimate goal process improve economic welfare. it also imply fully integrate trading, industrial financial chains; adopt unique economic management philosophy, unique regulatory institutional practice; acknowledge harmonise rule game apply throughout european area. in context, i would like highlight two key moments:  first, european integration process strong anchor structural reforms: legal, regulatory, institutional, infrastructural, political ones. albania still long way go peculiarity economy provide necessary space calibrate model accordance comparative advantage primary need country. however, i believe would useful reform integrate unique vision integration.  second, albanian business lot hasten integration process. it active adopt advance technologies, production management processes. likewise, albanian financial sector

consider economic financial stability country prerequisite sustainable long-term development. now, long theoretical matter discipline behaviour politics towards economy, discussion respect equality generations. it bitter lesson learn late crisis tangible reality many country euro area. we persistently invite policymakers economic agent country partake vision. a country’s monetary authority mandate guarantee price stability, work continue ensure low-inflation environment. this environment boost guarantee saver investor long-term plan provide financial system development. the bank albania implement modern monetary policy base advance principle central banking, employ instrument communication approach line ecb practices. the commitment bank albania maintain price stability polar star work. draft implement monetary policy independently, exclusively function price stability, one domestic anchor albanian economy, preserve strengthened. in parallel, bank albania deem albanian economy need two additional anchors: financial stability fiscal stability. our regulatory supervisory function bank system, account 95% financial system albania, prove successful guarantee country’s financial stability. this function carry discharge line international best practices, constant cooperation homologous institution international partners. the possibility integrate vision economic financial developments, combine mix monetary policy macroprudential measures, enhance effectiveness bank albania’s actions, contribute good achieve two individual objectives: financial stability price stability. the institutional regulation, prove effective line late global trends, continue function second anchor domestic economic anchors. finally, bank albania deem albania immediately establish clear transparent fiscal rule, also effective one discipline fiscal policy maintain trust financial market public finance soundness. this third anchor would complete framework domestic anchor economic policy. together close cooperation international financial institutions, would provide consistent transparent framework country’s development. provision liquidity solvency albanian economy bilateral multilateral partnership priority central bank policies. this vision partnership become axis cooperation national institutions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 louis kasekende: financial stability –

federal reserve system, yale law school conference challenge global financial services, new haven, connecticut, 20 september 2013. * * * real world crisis way shake intellectual foundation policy disciplines. element receive wisdom undermined, certain heterodox le mainstream view see valid important widely recognized. the financial crisis 2007–2009 exception. some ideas, efficient market hypothesis, take hits, others rise prominence. an example latter view financial stability must explicit economic policy goal. a corollary view “macroprudential” perspective – generally characterize focus financial system whole oppose well-being individual firm – add traditional prudential regulation. a single speech cannot hope touch on, much le justice to, many theoretical policy issue encompass term macroprudential. in remark afternoon i focus principally project recast regulation supervision large financial firm realize macroprudential objective reduce systemic risk. specifically, i offer five proposition i think guide project next couple years. in doing, i explain key step already take identify priority remain, though even i pretend comprehensiveness. before address macroprudential dimension regulate large financial firms, however, let provide context briefly review evolve idea macroprudential policy. macroprudential policy although crisis aftermath create broad consensus proposition financial stability explicit objective economic policy, considerably le convergence around theory of, metric for, policy prescription promote, financial stability. policy academic write generally limit term “macroprudential” measure direct specifically counter risk financial system that, realized, severely impact real activity.1 but adoption consistent terminology resolve question whether, example, increase systemic risk endogenous financial system thus follow somewhat regular cyclical pattern, instead somewhat randomized, albeit repeated, phenomena.2 difference view origin systemic risk obviously affect view best way measure and, course, best policy contain it. one example, particular interest central bankers, ongoing debate circumstance monetary policy adjust take account financial stability concerns. lie behind 1 thus, example, fiscal tax policy would generally characterize macroprudential tools, even though could implication systemic risk circumstances. for useful overview macroprudential policy issue debates, see international monetary fund (2011), “macroprudential policy: an organize framework (pdf),” (washington: international monetary fund, march 14); gabriele galati richhild moessner (2011), “macroprudential policy – literature review (pdf),” bi work paper no. 337 (basel, switzerland: bank international settlements, february). 2 for recent study find correlation growth credit aggregate financial crises, also suggest secular trend make crisis risk, see moritz schularick alan m. taylor (2012), “credit boom go bust: monetary policy, leverage cycles, financial crises, 1870–2008,” american economic review, vol. 102 (2), pp 1029–61. 2 bi central bankers’ speech various position debate differ view systemic risk propagates, thus relative efficacy monetary versus macroprudential policies. progress debate complicate fact that, definition, financial stability policy direct toward prevent mitigate rare events, rather outcome inflation unemployment continuously observable. this focus tail risk raise important issue accountability institutional design macroprudential policy also complicate task test financial stability theory propose policies. yet even backdrop still comparatively underdevelop understand financial stability,3 commentator policymakers compile and, cases, develop so-called “toolkits” possible macroprudential measures. these measure think available use one two frequently identify dimension systemic risk: procyclicality interconnectedness.4 of course, attractiveness many tool depend one’s view variety theoretical, institutional, practical questions. the tool identify variously categorized. one useful distinction measure design prevent systemic risk build (often term “lean-against-the-wind” measures) design increase resiliency financial system systemic risk nonetheless build sufficiently broad-based stress ensues. another distinction time-varying time-invariant measures, former base response – either discretionary accordance rule – measure increase risk. macroprudential foundation regulation large bank organization it worth note term “macroprudential regulation” find bank international settlement (bis) document begin 30 year ago. it appear originate specific contrast traditional bank regulation, 1979 background paper bi characterize focus “sound bank practice protection depositor level individual bank.”5 in fact, much new deal legislation would define financial regulatory structure 40 year direct response would today call systemic concerns, include bank panic excessive leverage equity markets.6 in late 1970s, though, indeed reason development explicitly macroprudential perspective. the new deal regulatory system begin break face profound change financial markets, importantly progressive integration capital market traditional lend 3 there actually quite rich history policy measure unite state would today call “macroprudential.” see douglas j. elliott, greg feldberg, andreas lehnert (2013), “the history cyclical macroprudential policy unite states,” finance economics discussion series 2013–29 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, may). it notable enactment use number tool wan integration capital market traditional lend function accelerate last quarter 20th century, though even causal relationship two phenomenon, clear way causality run (perhaps directions). 4 the terminology may differ among commentators. for example, “cross-sectional” sometimes use place interconnectedness, term may appeal extent move away traditional domino image one fail firm knock another, also embrace dynamic contagion across financial system arise correlate asset hold source funding. 5 piet clement (2010), “the term ‘macroprudential’: origin evolution (pdf),” bi quarterly review (march), pp. 2–3. 6 the establishment federal deposit insurance separation commercial bank investment bank – two key element new deal financial reform – much direct would today characterize systemic risks. bi central bankers’ speech 3 activities. the form regulation evolve substitute – principally, though only, minimum capital requirement – largely base various bi paper characterize microprudential approach regulation. it is, however, equally worth note use term macroprudential – and, would seem, influence concern lie behind term – somewhat irregular three decade coined. discussion concept implication regulation likely find paper academic intrepid bi researcher pronouncement senior regulator official sector representatives. one important exception speech deliver september 2000 late andrew crockett, general manager bis.7 for several reasons, speech good point reference u today – nod sir andrew’s foresight, occasion regret word closely heed regulators,8 way illustrate challenge macroprudential financial regulation grow year since. sir andrew’s speech contain much familiar broadly accepted, fairly uncommon time: he distinguish objective microprudential regulation – protect idiosyncratic risk bank – macroprudential regulation – protect systemic risk. he set forth description financial cycle could read loose paraphrase hyman minsky’s theory financial instability.9 he identify procyclical asset-correlation concern regard large bank activity command much attention past several years. and, foreshadow many recent discussions, suggest macroprudential tool increase resiliency (as capital regulation systemic perspective) lean wind effort slow limit growth unsustainable asset bubble (as maximum loan-to-value ratio requirements). the crockett speech hold well today. with benefit experience gain intervene financial crisis, intense period analysis macroprudential perspective, variety regulatory initiatives, i offer five proposition reinforce supplement view sir andrew express 13 year ago. five proposition macroprudential approach regulate financial institution 1. a macroprudential perspective should dominate regulation supervision large financial institutions. sir andrew entitle speech “marrying micro- macro-prudential dimension financial stability,” suggest equal partnership two regulatory dimensions, call them. my sense need concentrate post-crisis effort reshape regulation supervision large financial institution 7 andrew d. crockett, general manager bank international settlement chairman financial stability forum (2000), “marrying micro- macro-prudential dimension financial stability (pdf),” speech deliver eleventh international conference bank supervisor basel, switzerland, september 21. 8 read lines, one wonder whether sir andrew anticipate call action might take bank regulators. he style remark “provocative” conclude suggest “a small awareness-raising step what, pursued, likely long road.” 9 crockett, 2000 speech: “a review instance financial instability would reveal share stylise elements. there first over-extension phase financial imbalance build up, accompany benign economic conditions. in phase, asset price buoyant surge tend feed, feed by, rapid credit expansion, domestically internationally. leverage, overt hide forms, accumulate balance sheets, mask part favourable asset price developments. the trigger reversal essentially unpredictable. it originate either financial sphere (e.g., asset price correction) real economy (e.g., spontaneous unwind investment boom). the process move reverse. ex post, financial cycle evident.” 4 bi central bankers’ speech measure reflect macroprudential dimension, least time. this view consistent congressional emphasis financial stability systemic risk consideration dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act.10 to sure, idiosyncratic problem certain operational risk may threaten large institutions, traditional regulation supervision surely important ongoing role play. but dynamic observe financial crisis highly correlate asset holdings, share risks, contagion among large firm suggest well-being one firm cannot consider isolation well-being system whole. severe problem institution far likely arise vulnerability common stresses, severe problem firm far likely exacerbate systemic weaknesses. since health one large institution tie health firm group, good microprudential regulation may require macroprudential dimension. the reorientation federal reserve’s supervision large, complex financial firm reflect organizationally large institution supervision coordinate committee (liscc). the liscc create three year ago facilitate execution horizontal, cross-firm analysis large firm centralize supervision firm promote integrate consistent supervisory approach. the liscc include senior staff supervisory staff board reserve banks, also board’s office financial stability, division monetary affairs, division research statistics, relevant divisions. this “interdisciplinary” approach large bank supervision foster rigorous microprudential regulation, also facilitate formalize broad look systemic risk use quantitative method evaluate macroeconomic financial risks, could affect individual firm firm collectively. 2. build great resiliency central macroprudential regulation large financial institutions. in early 2009 widespread doubt solvency financial system whole, particularly many large firm directly indirectly deeply involve mortgage market associate securitizations. when create first supervisory stress test fly, were, aim stabilize, restore confidence in, financial system whole ensure 19 large bank hold company sufficiently capitalize could continue serve viable financial intermediaries. so focus resiliency initially matter necessity. but also logic make resiliency large firm important part ongoing macroprudential regulatory agenda. just microprudential approach regulation come emphasize build capital make individual firm good able absorb loss source, include unpredictable ones, appropriately refocus set macroprudential capital requirement help make financial system good able withstand shock unanticipated, well familiar, sources. a mention andrew crockett, macroprudential perspective suggest two way resiliency strengthened: first treat financial system whole “portfolio” asset subject safety soundness oversight; second apply strict regulation firm systemic importance whose failure would carry good chance endanger entire system. in last four years, develop kind measure increase resiliency. follow use stress test nation’s 19 large bank hold company midst crisis, congress include dodd-frank act requirement annual 10 elsewhere i discuss emphasis length. see daniel k. tarullo (2012), “financial stability regulation,” speech deliver distinguish jurist lecture, university pennsylvania law school, philadelphia, pa, october 10. bi central bankers’ speech 5 supervisory stress test large group firms: great $50 billion assets. these stress tests, associate supervisory review capital process practice cover firms, year become core part oversight large firms. our stress test program one form first type macroprudential resiliency measure. it also provide good example sound microprudential regulation large bank firm difficult distinguish regulation macroprudential orientation. conventional capital requirement nature somewhat backward-looking, reflect loss expectation base past experience loss recognition often occur well likelihood loss become clear. rigorous stress test help compensate shortcoming forward-looking assessment loss would suffer stipulate adverse economic scenarios, capital build maintain level high enough firm withstand loss still remain viable financial intermediaries. this forward-looking aspect stress test automatically build capital, boost resilience, face weaken loan-underwriting standard because, give adverse scenario, weak underwrite standard imply high losses. also, firm stress simultaneously, supervisor able identify take account correlate exposure common risks.11 the firm cover dodd-frank act supervisory stress test account 70 percent u.s. bank sector assets, thus approach sir andrew’s standard supervisory perspective examine asset financial system whole. the effectiveness stress test macroprudential tool depends, course, test constructed. for example, macroprudential perspective must inform construction scenario asset revenue bank stressed. such perspective argue incorporate particular risk financial system even uncertainty regard probability particular risk realized. for example, scenario might include sharp drop house price analysis suggest – confirm – overheat house market, supervisor judge large bank correlate exposure house sector. that is, stress test provide resiliency event risk come pass, without necessarily require measure restrict directly lend activity lie behind risk. a macroprudential perspective also counsel inject procyclicality financial system by, example, simply assume standard deterioration economic condition whatever baseline projection might be. such approach would overlook tendency systemic risk build strong, prolong expansions, underwrite standard decline, rise asset price make secure lend seem safer, default wane. the approach instead take that, conditions, severely adverse scenario would assume level unemployment stress period comparable observe past severe recessions, simply increase unemployment comparable increase observe recessions.12 thus, 11 it important emphasize here, annual capital review large bank organizations, supervisory stress test cover firm simultaneously supplant need firm develop, make capital decision dependent upon, stress scenario incorporate risk specific activity portfolio firm. that is, necessary emphasis macroprudential measure present time obviate need solid microprudentially inspire measures. 12 for full explanation board’s approach scenario design, see “policy statement scenario design framework stress test (pdf),” regulation yy – enhance prudential standards, 12 c.f.r. pt. 252 (2012). see also nellie liang (2013), “implementing macroprudential policy (pdf),” speech deliver conference financial stability analysis: use tools, find data, federal reserve bank cleveland office financial research, may 31. 6 bi central bankers’ speech scenario’s unemployment rate would feature large sharp rise unemployment rate economic expansion proceed. finally, stress test must modify avoid incentivizing firm correlate asset hold adopt correlate hedge strategies. this potential problem illustrate reference market shock apply trade book six large financial firm last two stress tests. the shocks, design severe, consist instantaneous, hypothetical jump asset price base observe entire second half 2008. the result trade loss – one would expect – quite large. even so, simply use shock use 2009 exercise, unchanged historical experience, would underestimate potential loss associate subsequent developments. for reason, modify market shock scenario 2011 take account eurozone stress modify hypothesize stress 2012 include sharp move interest rates. we continue modify market shock regularly incorporate salient risk necessarily present 2008 ensure firm cannot artificially improve performance test hold significant amount certain asset happen perform well period. the second kind macroprudential resiliency measure reduce chance distress failure financial company systemic importance great degree firms. key provision dodd-frank aim form resiliency. one extend perimeter regulation authorize financial stability oversight council (fsoc) subject nonbank financial company supervision regulation federal reserve council “determines material financial distress” company, nature, size, characteristic activity “could pose threat financial stability unite states.”13 another require federal reserve establish broad set enhance prudential standards, bank hold company total consolidate asset $50 billion nonbank financial company designate fsoc systemically important, “[i]n order prevent mitigate risk financial stability unite states.”14 the require standard include capital requirements, liquidity requirements, stress testing, single-counterparty credit limits, early remediation regime, risk-management resolution-planning requirements. these requirement increase stringency accordance relative systemic importance companies. the capital surcharge apply authority provide clear example kind macroprudentially motivate regulation. a microprudential requirement inform ask level capital would necessary allow firm remain viable financial intermediary even absorb loss that, within fairly high level confidence, might encounter relevant timeframe. a macroprudential capital requirement take account fact would large negative externality associate disorderly failure systemically important financial institution (sifi), distinct cost incur firm, stakeholders, federal deposit insurance fund. a already suggested, failure firm, especially period stress, significantly increase chance financial firm experience great stress, two reasons. first, direct counterparty impact lead classic domino effect. second, loss tail event much likely correlate firm deeply engage trading, structure products, capital market instruments, firm vulnerable accelerate loss trouble firm sell asset decline market. enhance capital requirement take account costs. thus, aim 13 dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act, pub. l. no. 111–203, 124 stat. 1376 (2010), section 113 (a)(1). 14 dodd-frank act, section 165. bi central bankers’ speech 7 financial stability capital standard reduce probability firm might fail stress requirement hold additional capital. these additional capital requirement also help offset fund advantage derive perceive status institution too-big-to-fail. in act rationale capital standard mitigate risk financial stability, first seek ensure would international initiative develop financial stability capital standard global systemically important financial institutions. the basel committee, international body supervisor include u. s. bank agencies, take agenda develop framework cover two dozen large financial firm around world. late year, issue authority grant dodd-frank propose set capital surcharge congruent framework. the task determine much additional capital need reduce probability systemically important firm’s failure acceptable level straightforward one. in calibrate surcharge, basel committee, good bite input federal reserve, begin term “expected impact” approach, call additional capital reduce probability firm’s failure sufficiently equalize expect impact financial system failure systemically important firm failure bank firm outside systemic status.15 but implement concept complicate fact that, despite useful metric develop past year measure systemic risk associate particular firm, certainly generally accept approach.16 indeed, difference among reasonable assumption apply expect impact approach lead fairly broad range potential surcharges. the 1 2–1/2 percent amount negotiate within basel committee low end range, reflect good deal caution – frankly, caution i think would desirable, even give uncertainties. regardless one’s view calibration, though, motivation methodology become know “sifi surcharges” clearly macroprudential. one last point macroprudential resiliency measure secondary effect serve lean-against-the-wind aim macroprudential policies. for example, supervisory stress test assign high loss rate certain class asset hypothesize adverse scenario particularly vulnerable potential shock thus susceptible particularly sharp decline serious recession. to extent firm learn time asset treat way, least mild disincentive hold them. a i discus moment respect countercyclical capital requirements, overstate lean-against-the-wind effect, perhaps dismiss hand either. 15 for example, loss financial system failure systemically important firm would five time result failure non-systemic firm, firm would hold additional capital sufficient make expect probability failure one-fifth non-systemic institution. 16 among useful effort along line measure conditional value-at-risk (covar) (see tobias adrian markus k. brunnermeier (2011), “covar (pdf),” federal reserve bank new york staff report 348 (new york: federal reserve bank new york, september), measure systemic risk base firm’s contribution expect capital shortfall entire financial system crisis (see christian t. brownlees robert f. engle (2011), “volatility, correlation tail systemic risk measurement,” new york university work paper (new york: new york university, june). the concept behind latter measure also describe viral v. acharya, christian brownlees, farhang farazmand, matthew richardson (2011), “measuring systemic risk,” regulate wall street: the dodd-frank act new architecture global finance (new york: wiley publishers), pp. 87–119. update systemic risk rank maintain author here. a helpful review effort measure systemic risk monica billio, mila getmansky, andrew w. lo, loriana pelizzon (2010), “measuring systemic risk finance insurance sector (pdf),” mit sloan school work paper 4774–10 (cambridge, ma: mit sloan school management, march). 8 bi central bankers’ speech 3. time-varying measure will play more limit role. some discussion macroprudential policy appear contemplate somewhat regular adjustment – – resiliency lean-against-the-wind measures. the idea proceed intentionally countercyclical fashion attempt restrain rapid, unsustainable increase credit extension asset price relax restraint economic condition deteriorate. this conceptually appeal approach, but, various commentator macroprudential policy option noted, one raise fair number significant issues: reliability measure excess systemic risk, appropriate official make macroprudential decisions, speed measure might realistically implement take effect, right calibration measure effective damp excess unnecessarily reduce well-underwritten credit flow economy. if measure design targeted, question efficacy may raise believe suppression excess credit asset price increase one sector likely result redirection credit speculation sector underlie macroeconomic financial condition cease enable activities. if, hand, measure design fairly broad-based, basic question appropriate role monetary policy may raise focus reactive policy “get cracks” financial system, heavily regulate portion occupy large financial firms. finally, probably skeptical effective macroprudential relaxation regulatory requirement downside economic cycles. market discipline, may lax boom years, tend become strict condition deteriorate rapidly. even supervisor announce relaxation regulatory requirements, stress economic conditions, investor counterparties may well look unfavorably reduction capital level (even high levels) relaxation underwrite standard one firm, notwithstanding potential benefit economy whole large firm follow suit. anticipate reaction, senior management bank may thus strong non-regulatory incentive act microprudential regulation continue dominate. in short, task buff financial system tail event seem tractable moderate financial cycle. but question economic knowledge institutional capacity grind proceed cautiously, eschew time-varying measure entirely. it true state art financial stability risk assessment still relatively early stage. but reasonable think amount effort put effort governments, central banks, international organizations, university produce well-conceived well-tested metric time. some deviation historical pattern are, even exist state knowledge, surely clear enough justify action. moreover, absence time-varying macroprudential tools, burden systemic risk containment rest entirely elsewhere. for time invariant measure bear burden, might necessary through-the-cycle constraint strengthen financial stability great cost economic activity. if central bank reluctant ever use monetary policy pursuit financial stability goal expense immediate employment price stability goals, burden time invariant measure would large indeed. even financial stability objective effectively incorporate monetary policy, monetary tighten surely correct response instance increase leverage asset price raise macroprudential concerns. well-developed time-varying measure might effective slow increase systemic risk give monetary policymakers time evaluate need monetary policy response. there two obvious place begin consider development time-varying tools. one traditional supervisory oversight practice regulate institutions, enhance bi central bankers’ speech 9 increasingly horizontal, interdisciplinary feature large bank supervision. good supervision always time-varying, respond potential grow problem direct fashion.17 the coordination engender liscc parallel effort facilitate identification potentially risky trend in, example, underwrite certain form lending. the great use data, regulate sector collect supervisor economy whole analyze office financial stability, increase prospect timely supervisory responses. i want overstate significance evolution supervisory practice, however. for one thing, show experience commercial real estate lend guidance issue crisis, supervisory guidance imperfect tool. in addition issue surround real-time intervention mention earlier, episode reveal potential substantial political resistance supervisory action direct specific sectors. still, institutionalization financial stability concern federal reserve fsoc, ongoing improvement relevant analytic capacities, room develop tool further. the second place work time-varying tool find another element new capital regime, countercyclical buff provision basel iii. this provision envision increase applicable risk-weighted capital requirement financial company 2–1/2 percentage point “credit growth excessive lead buildup system-wide risk.”18 while stress test built-in degree time-variance (since macroeconomic scenario must construct annually), countercyclical buff intend purely time variant, activate when, when, “excess aggregate credit growth,” condition basel committee anticipate occur infrequently.19 the principal macroprudential rationale countercyclical buff one increase resiliency: bank system whole enough capital continue effective intermediation, even period stress follow turn period unsustainable, rapid credit growth lead unusually high loss asset price plummet thereafter.20 the basel committee also note could secondary, lean-against-the-wind effect high capital requirement raise cost of, thus dampen, credit extension. 17 one note “time-varying” supervision mean excessively procyclical supervision. 18 basel committee bank supervision (2011), “basel iii: a global regulatory framework more resilient bank bank system (pdf),” (basel, switzerland: bank international settlements, june), p. 57. basel ii introduce concept capital “buffer” supplement long-established concept minimum capital requirements. in brief, idea bank’s distribution capital shareholder employee progressively restrict capital level fall require buffers, – unlike case capital level fall minimum requirement – bank need bring capital level buff shed asset raise new capital. basel iii introduce “fixed” capital buff 2–1/2 percent common equity top 4–1/2 percent minimum capital requirement. the countercyclical capital buff would place top fix buffer. if apply maximum 2–1/2 percent amount, countercyclical buff would thus require bank maintain equity capital least 9–1/2 percent risk-weighted asset order remain unencumbered restriction capital distributions. there view hold large bank would considerable market pressure maintain capital level 7 percent total minimum requirement fix buff (as well add systemic surcharge bank subject it), even stress periods. 19 basel committee bank supervision (2011). 20 basel committee bank supervision (2010), “guidance national authority operate countercyclical capital buff (pdf),” (basel, switzerland: bank international settlements, december), p. 1. 10 bi central bankers’ speech it probably surprise regulator represent basel committee choose capital requirement time-varying macroprudential tool. capital regulation central prudential regulation and, already noted, use service macroprudential objectives. both regulator financial institution accustom capital regime (although post-crisis change alter regime quite significantly). still, uncertain useful tool be.21 in addition limitation affect use time-varying instruments, judge leverage asset price become excessive, quite blunt. if “turned on,” would apply large bank part country. so would useful deploy response asset bubble leverage particular sectors, since additional capital require lend sector would great le frothy part economy. indeed, could circumstance unintended effect encourage bank lend boom area concern, expense lend stable areas. the precise impact bank lend behavior muddy one-year period give build additional capital cushion. these potential shortcoming notwithstanding, tool available unite state three federal bank regulatory agencies. it could, fact, serve complement target action available supervisory process. the bank agency include countercyclical capital provision capital regulation implement basel iii adopt summer. however, take effect unite state 2016 regulatory supervisory task create dodd-frank initiative need complete quickly, yet build tool policy statement institutional steps. fortunately, turn countercyclical capital buffer, benefit good deal think experience bank england. the set countercyclical capital buff commit financial policy committee (fpc) reorganization regulatory function effect unite kingdom april 1, 2013. the fpc require set forth general statement policy make quarterly determination whether impose change countercyclical buffer.22 i note, however, parliament extend countercyclical power beyond broad measure basel iii also grant fpc authority direct increase risk-weights applicable specific sector judge pose risk financial system. while bank regulator unite state certainly similar authority part broad power set capital requirements, date considered, much le adopted, regulation along lines. 4. high priority develop measure control structural vulnerability present short-term wholesale funding. the share vulnerability large bank organization whole underscore something omit sir andrew’s otherwise prescient speech: potential damage fire sales, exacerbate prevalence short-term funding. the use short-term wholesale fund hardly unknown among major financial firm 1990s, broaden significantly thereafter, within large firm sponsor entity infamous structure investment vehicle (sivs) use fund asset-backed securities. this trend dramatic example way 21 for useful discussion pro con variant countercyclical capital buffers, see douglas j. elliott (2011), “an overview macroprudential policy countercyclical capital requirements,” (washington: the brook institution, march 10). 22 a draft policy statement publish even april 1, 2013, effective date new fpc authority. see bank england (2013), “the financial policy committee’s power supplement capital requirement (pdf),” (london, u.k.: bank england, january). bi central bankers’ speech 11 traditional lend capital market activity become increasingly integrate another example prudential regulation quickly enough adjust trend. early week, reach five-year anniversary lehman brothers’ failure, numerous retrospective crisis remind u multiple causes. but practice many firms, include sizeable broker-dealers, fund large amount asset short-term wholesale fund accelerant problem grow within financial system. when question arise quality asset short-term fund provided, investor regard short-term secure lend essentially risk-free suddenly become unwilling lend wide range assets. then ensue classic adverse feedback loop, liquidity-strained institution find force sell positions, place additional downward pressure asset prices, thereby accelerate margin call leverage actor amplify mark-to-market loss holder assets. although amount short-term wholesale fund come pre-crisis peaks,23 structural vulnerability remains, particularly fund channel group head security finance transaction (sfts).24 the use fund surely potential increase period rapid asset appreciation ready access leverage. while sfts important useful part security markets, without effective regulation create large run risk, thus increase systemic problem may develop various asset lend markets. the risk associate short-term fund much macroprudential firm-specific. from microprudential perspective, sfts low risk, borrow short-dated, overcollateralized, marked-to-market daily, subject remargining

bankers’ speech 1 jwala rambarran: consolidate supervision, risk-based supervision market discipline open remark mr jwala rambarran, governor central bank trinidad tobago, basel ii implementation workshop, organise caribbean regional technical assistance centre (cartac), port spain, 17–20 september 2013. * * * good morning first, i wish thank cartac arrange basel ii implementation workshop invite give brief open remark morning. a know, safe robust bank operate well regulate financial system play key role economy society. one main lesson recent global financial crisis bank must improve ability manage risk, inflict serious damage economy. this call strong risk management culture within banks. this call strong regulation supervision within central bank regulatory agencies. in today’s discourse, commentator assume “strengthening regulation” simply matter implement international standards, important basel capital accord, design basel committee bank supervision. other commentators, however, examine alternative approach prudential regulation beyond standards. they argue strategy prudential policy must address three main weaknesses: impossibility fine-tune bank safety margin uncharted territory bank develop world; need provide insulation large shock economy prone; lack enforcement result concentration political power many countries. this year mark 25th anniversary 1998 basel capital accord, two incarnation emerge international gold standard banks‟ capital requirements. the first manifestation come june 2004 basel committee wholly rewrite original basel accord, number flaws. for instance, risk insensitive, differentiate credit risk risk bank typically faces, easily circumvent regulatory arbitrage. the new accord, generally know basel 2, represent fundamental change approach regulation. the revise framework highly complex make understand implementation great challenge, regulator also regulate community. basel 2, example, assume discipline market supervisor beneficial. yet, see particularly, last five years, market government can, do, fail. the second incarnation original basel accord see g-20 country start implement basel 3 capital rules, deliver many consider world’s first global liquidity standard banks. the jury still basel 3. a many know (or least i hope know), basel committee right impose standard produce others, never, least explicitly, seek constrain national authority so. nevertheless, 100 country implement three version basel accord different form vary speeds. here caribbean, jurisdiction still seek fully comply basel 1 move basel 2, others focus first satisfy pillar 2 basel 2 framework. the region, whole, decide put adoption basel 2 hold follow criticism approach wake eruption international financial crisis 2 bi central bankers’ speech mid-2007. five year later, one might even perhaps question region focus basel 3 time. so caribbean region grapple implementation basel accord. perhaps answer, respectful view, basel framework never really design develop country mind, implementation version develop country likely fraught difficulties. there number factor determine speed basel accord implementation plan different country world. these include size, structure degree financial sector development, level economic development, capacity exist regulatory supervisory authorities. application factor caribbean reveal following: first, small island state caribbean experience great macroeconomic volatility, great volatility external flow great vulnerability external shock industrial countries. secondly, new version basel framework rely strong institutions. in caribbean, institution limit rent-seeking weak: banker bureaucrat opportunity incentive reap private benefit public cost. basel 3, example, presume sophisticate integrate risk management system place, caribbean generally case. and thirdly, skill scarce caribbean. supervision market discipline require skilled supervisor market participants. i, therefore, believe timely regional work committee basel 2 implementation start think develop regional prudential road map appropriately tailor circumstances. such road map take least three concern account. these follows: 1. pay attention stability financial system, risk constituent parts. remember, two bank failure probability different size present risk depositor different risk system. macro-prudential data likely give good warn policymakers build-up financial imbalances. 2. take away punch bowl party get going. we learn hard way music playing, banker want dance. one way restrain excess boom impose countercyclical prudential requirement lessen procyclical nature basel 2 framework credit risk. these countercyclical prudential requirement include minimum capital ratios, collateral haircuts, liquidity currency mismatch limits. 3. rely, much possible, simple rule easy write, communicate, enforce verify. agreement implementation global regulatory agenda gradual. the reform momentum wan due lack agreement specific issue especially national political pressure trump global consensus. these delay add regulatory uncertainty weigh heavily financial sector. in closing, i want emphasize amount regulation intensive supervision able catch poor financial conduct, malfeasance unlawful activity, time. a mark carney, current governor bank england, remark “virtue cannot regulated.” i wish productive workshop. bi central bankers’ speech 1 emmanuel tumusiime-mutebile: the plan introduction east african monetary union remark mr emmanuel tumusiime-mutebile, governor bank uganda, open east african legislative assembly consultative workshop east african monetary union, kampala, 9 september 2013. * * * honourable minister honourable member east african legislative assembly lady gentleman the issue gather discus today – plan introduction east african monetary union (eamu) – one profound effect region decade come. late year i expect head state partner state east african community (eac) sign protocol introduction eamu. the protocol pave way transition eamu course next 10 year complementary legal, institutional economic reforms. the east african monetary union project potentially large long term benefit economy eac also entail considerable risks. the long term success eamu dependent upon major change public policy way public policy make partner state eac. a successful monetary union possible partner state prepare accept pool economic sovereignty. many economic decision make national level make regional level. this pool economic sovereignty extend beyond loss independent national monetary policy exchange rates, course inherent monetary union; also require partner state accept constraint fiscal policy implement fully provision common market, include free trade good service within eac also free movement capital labour within eac. if build requisite foundation monetary union, introduction eamu may actually harm economies. the problem currently experience peripheral member euro zone – greece, portugal spain example – lose competitiveness international market long use exchange rate depreciation restore competitiveness, provide salutary lesson everyone involve plan introduction eamu. without wish pre-empt contribution colleague eac secretariat, ministry finance, plan economic development economic policy research council hear late workshop, i would like take minute time explain i believe monetary union east africa make important contribution long term development region, potentially help accelerate transition economy middle income status, also identify critical prerequisite successful introduction eamu. why monetary union important east africa? the partner state eac implement custom union common market order promote regional economic integration. deep regional economic integration provide major spur development partner state strengthen competition within respective domestic markets, allow producer reap great economy scale thus become efficient, widen opportunity trade. the regional market also provide step stone domestic producer access global markets. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the primary rationale monetary union cement benefit regional economic integration. replace individual currency one single common currency reduce cost risk transact business across national boundary partner state eac. monetary union remove cost transact different currency risk adverse exchange rate movement trade within east africa. furthermore, combine economy partner state together diversify individual partner state, le vulnerable external shock commodity price shock consequence, volatility common exchange rate major currency dollar euro le volatility currently exist national currency partner states. exchange rate volatility major risk business deterrent private investment, especially trade good sector economy. hence eliminate entirely exchange rate movement within eac, reduce exchange rate volatility respect third party currency outside eac, eamu reduce commercial risk business east africa and, such, help promote private investment. eamu also important future east africa signal send rest world. have common currency one clear statement intent eac make demonstrate long term commitment deep regional integration. it send message foreign investor eac really genuine single market business. because involve major loss economic sovereignty, introduction eamu also political statement commitment partner state eac common future east africans, rather citizen individual nation states. what prerequisite success monetary union? the first prerequisite eamu partner state implement custom union common market full. this mean remove non tariff barrier (ntbs) intra-regional trade eac. it mean allow firm service industries, transport firms, domicile partner state sell service without restriction partner states. it also mean accept without precondition free movement labour throughout eac: example kenyan able live work uganda without restriction without pay work residency permits. finally, mean allow free movement capital across border within eac. free capital mobility within eac meaningful partner state impose restriction purchase asset investor partner state. a genuine single market eac, without restriction movement goods, service factor production, essential foundation eamu two reasons. first, benefit monetary union partner state positively correlate amount trade partner state degree integration economies. unless substantial trade within eac, minor benefit derive common currency. east africa able attain full degree economic integration possible artificial barrier intra-regional trade movement factor production within eac abolished. secondly, member state eac inevitably suffer call “idiosyncratic economic shocks”; shock affect economy one member state others. for economy currency independent monetary policy, optimal response macroeconomic shock usually involve monetary exchange rate policy; example, economy might adjust negative term trade shock depreciation real exchange rate restore external balance. it self evident membership monetary union mean national authority cannot use either monetary exchange rate policy adjust idiosyncratic macroeconomic shock, leave vulnerable adverse consequence shocks. bi central bankers’ speech 3 however, regional integration offer alternative adjustment mechanism country experience idiosyncratic shocks. for example, suppose economy one partner state suffer major decline international price one main exports. such shock would reduce income exporter thereby cut aggregate demand, cause recession domestic economy shock large enough. in case, shock aggregate demand could mitigate domestic producer able redirect output market partner states. hence initial idiosyncratic shock one partner state absorb partner state within monetary union, lessen adverse impact partner state suffer initial shock. but mechanism adjustment possible barrier trade across national boundary within eac, much difficult ugandan firm sell good service kenya uganda itself. another example dutch disease often create domestic spend generate natural resource boom. the adverse impact dutch disease mitigate entry resource boom economy labour service sector firm partner states, ease supply constraint thus inflationary pressure resource boom economy. the point i want emphasize that, introduce monetary union without first put place genuine common market act shock absorber idiosyncratic shock hit individual economies, run risk expose economy great macroeconomic volatility. the second prerequisite successful monetary union sound fiscal policy, clearly demonstrate problem currently afflict euro zone members, notably greece. the credibility monetary policy common central bank eac depend never finance fiscal deficit partner states. unfortunately, difficult common central bank credibly commit never finance fiscal deficit partner state, may circumstance provide deficit finance least bad option available alternative allow sovereign default occur risk systemic financial crisis throughout eac. this dilemma face european central bank since global financial crisis break out: sovereign default in, example, italy would affect italians; damage would spread throughout eurozone contagion financial institution euro zone members. to avoid danger monetary policy undermine bail government partner state, necessary public debt partner state eamu must sustainable also perceive sustainable, government always fully meet borrow requirement market without resort finance common central bank avoid sovereign default. to ensure public debt sustainability institutional mechanism must put place, enforced, impose ceiling fiscal deficit public debt. the euro zone mechanism ensure public debt sustainability stability growth pact, properly enforced. in eac formulate fiscal rule curb fiscal deficit public borrowing. these target set eamu protocol sign late year. it go without say imperative fiscal rule comply times. failure abide fiscal rule could fatally undermine prospect successful monetary union. 4 bi central bankers’ speech conclusion the introduction monetary union undoubtedly challenge project ever undertake regional level east africa. the difficulty risk involve underestimated. the potential long term benefit monetary union large. if monetary union design well implement properly, contribute fast growth trade, productivity, job output several decades. but benefit realize unless partner state prepare undertake radical reform necessary put place essential foundation monetary union, include implementation full common market within eac establishment rule base sound fiscal policies. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: improve performance albania’s bank sector speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, year-end event albanian association banks, tirana, 17 december 2013. * * * dear bank executives, your excellency ambassador sequi, dear mr. ilahi, dear mr. pencabligil, it pleasure participate year-end meeting, reflect challenge face objective accomplish year, endeavour identify issue may arise next year. give celebration time spirit meeting, i would rather dwell upon issue i would like to. however, i share opinion two issue i consider important good performance bank sector 2014. before move on, acknowledge year leave behind difficult one bank sector. in development cycle one decade, year, bank sector’s growth slow sharply annual lend level contracted. deteriorate asset quality, dictate credit, lead low financial profit due high provision needed. these development reflect overall economic slowdown domestic demand drop result low private consumption investments. however, development highlight bank sector’s capacity properly respond cope challenges. the bank sector maintain ample liquidity capital level thank rise public deposit add capital parent banks. in term non-performing loans, obvious effort make restructure credit sell non-performing loan non-bank financial institutions. the albanian association bank play active role discuss problem relevant authority identify solution regulatory treatment non-performing loans, notably, legal amendment collateral execution process, enter force september 2013. through activity, bank industry may transform 2014 good year bank industry albanian economy. i think may achieve hard work follow aspects: the first aspect pertain restore lend adequate level albania. this objective may achieve interlink three elements: a) clean balance sheet non-performing loans. it indispensible mark evident progress 2014 write loss loan balance sheet engage cautious credit restructuring, necessary. the improvement fiscal handle loan write-offs, near future, expect good support process; however, justify sluggish protract action. i, therefore, call utmost commitment successfully implement project initiate world bank regard. additionally, quantitative objective reduce level non-performing loan include institution’s annual work plan 2014; b) evaluate select new loan application professional fashion. indeed, credit demand remain weak; however, exist must view term potential growth future. in regard, bank industry 2 bi central bankers’ speech strengthen analysis steer lend toward sector economy high development potentials. priority also give launch bank product boost credit demand small medium-sized enterprises, mitigate credit risk portfolio diversification improve stable return bank lending; c) reduce lend costs. i refer interest rate apply lek loans. to opinion, inadequately reflect key interest rate trend expectations. from decrease interest rate apply government borrowing, understand inert move cost lend reflect risk premia bank industry impose lend private sector. for 2014, think bank industry good support private sector, consider that: • imf’s agreement albania mitigate government’s need borrowing; • public arrears private sector expect begin pay shortly; • worsen financial ratio bank industry impose gradual return lend private sector, order improve generation income. second, i would like underline need significant improvement technical capacity structure risk management. in regard, decision make include analytical assessment performance institution various scenarios. this requirement stipulate exist regulatory framework, monitor additional caution next year. in view, element constitute bank management quality indicator. spar details, i would like emphasize bank albania continue provide necessary support processes. we appreciate professional direct cooperation you, important element comply requirement supervisory regulatory framework. moreover, imf’s agreement additional financial support world bank european union contribute restore country’s long-term economic stability, translate macroeconomic stability high economic growth rates. i confident bank industry use moment identify best opportunity restructure improve performance expand activity, thus reassuming role engine country’s economic development. thank invitation, i would like wish good

board ecb. that give prestigious job cause great surprise germany. do chase out? draghi: jörg i excellent personal professional relationship. i consider great loss u return government. of course agree every occasion. spiegel: asmussen third german central banker give job prematurely, bundesbank bos axel weber former ecb executive board member jürgen stark. why aren’t german happy ecb? draghi: you can’t compare cases. jörg make clear family reason prompt go back berlin. i reason doubt that. spiegel: in case, weber stark resign policy, lead famous remark london year half ago “everything necessary” save euro. that means, emergency, buy government bond crisis-ridden country take risk amount billion end german taxpayer would liable. can understand many german citizen odds this? draghi: weber stark resign arrival ecb. but truth condition euro area improve considerably since then. consider late developments: crisis-ridden country ireland portugal exit bailout programme, risk premia loan crisis-hit country southern europe declining, investor world invest europe. in words, financial-economic data turn right direction. spiegel: be say euro crisis over? draghi: no, fear felt sector public germany confirmed. what haven’t accuse of? when offer european bank additional liquidity two year ago, say would high rate inflation. nothing happened. when i make comment london, talk violation central bank’s mandate. but make clear begin move within mandate. each time said, goodness’ sake, italian ruin germany. there perverse angst thing turn bad, opposite happened: inflation low uncertainty reduced. spiegel: the economic crisis europe still threaten blow euro. growth low, unemployment southern europe reach record levels. draghi: the crisis overcome, many encourage signs. the economy recover many countries, imbalance european trade decline budget deficit monetary union falling. that’s expect year ago. 2 bi central bankers’ speech spiegel: but debt level many euro area country rise unabated, there’s le willingness reform. greece, example, miss targets. doe country need another bailout? draghi: in greece, quite thing change better, country more, there’s doubt that. spiegel: in fact, situation disastrous. if state take emergency loan again, greece definitely live rest euro area. how country ever get back feet? draghi: some country need programme run three years, others take somewhat longer. in greece, position outset particularly difficult, particularly patient country. that’s surprise. spiegel: the reform process slow country well. france, example, make debts, plan reform labour market tax system move ahead. how concern development euro area’s second-largest country? draghi: france face problem country need get budget order make structural reforms. many state raise tax cut investment first. this easy way, approach weaken growth. a promise avenue bring current government spend introduce structural reform labour market. spiegel: the problem france isn’t that. aren’t get tire repeatedly urge country reform, nothing happens? draghi: in latin say: “repetita iuvant – repeat beneficial”. the few change make country, often i repeat messages. and works. spiegel: we feel number government long hear tune growing. the new coalition germany, example, want undo pension reform make red-green coalition government year ago introduce universal minimum wage €8.50. be policy help euro? draghi: it early ass policy new german government. i say crisis show monetary union incomplete weakness need remedied. germany help euro best strengthen competitiveness promote growth. whatever help process right, everything else wrong. spiegel: many economist represent completely different theory. they regard germany’s competitiveness real problem euro area call state curb exports. what think that? draghi: not much. it’s mechanistic perspective economic activity, there’s little i it. we won’t make weak strong make strong weaker, wise man said. that apply economy well. if germany le competitive, euro area whole would lose, le could produce then. bi central bankers’ speech 3 spiegel: in germany, ecb policy unpopular push interest rate investment far often long enough compensate inflation. in words, fool save. draghi: that’s fault ecb. the link short-term interest rate set ecb long-term interest rate pay investment relevant saver germany strong. spiegel: really? it’s state goal policy indirectly suppress long-term interest rates. draghi: no, especially recent years, unable control long-term interest rate – investor unsettle euro crisis. that’s everyone take money germany buy safe german government bonds. that’s interest rate germany fallen. we take concern saver seriously. but respond? we run monetary policy entire euro area, single country. if able dispel uncertainty, many investor take money germany back home country interest rate rise again. spiegel: people see statement life insurance company get ever small payouts year year interest rates. the truth saver pay price rescue euro. draghi: i sure insurance company refer key policy rate send statements. we control rate. long-term interest rate determine largely global financial markets. if feed decide buy u treasury bond worth usd 1 trillion year, affect interest rate worldwide. spiegel: the feed announce reduce purchase government bonds. what mean euro area euro? draghi: so far market show announcement fomc affect euro area markets. their resilience great year ago. spiegel: that help saver much. currently, get 0.8% interest per year save account germany, inflation rate 1.3%. do think normal healthy development? draghi: normal healthy not. the real interest rate positive normal conditions. today country negative, others positive even high. we aware risk fragmentation entails. spiegel: which risk mean? draghi: first, stability financial system risk interest rate low long. until now, however, see significant price increase specific limit markets, example, real estate market europe. the second serious risk inflation, already clearly 2% target, might fall further. yet aren’t see deflation, i.e. general fall prices. but must careful permanently fall 1% inflation thus danger zone. spiegel: how intend react – interest rate fall further? draghi: at moment see need immediate action. we don’t japanese conditions. there, expectation fall price become entrenched. in euro area, market participant convince inflation rise close 2% again. in 4 bi central bankers’ speech addition, japan long time respond resolutely term monetary policy ecb. and finally, bank company japan bad condition euro area today. spiegel: the condition european bank bad enough. so bank union go come create level play field bank euro area. how important project monetary union? draghi: extremely important. europe’s financial system still fragmented. although gap fund cost bank within euro area long wide two year ago. but lend difference still large, country credit flow disrupted. the bank union help restore confidence cross-border lending. the important objective asset quality review transparency. we want shed light hide banks’ balance sheets. spiegel: the eu agree procedure handle bank viable. doe new resolution mechanism meet wishes? draghi: i really want mechanism work. we, supervisory body, decide whether bank viable not. then resolution authority decide bank: close it, split sell it. the problem is, say bank viable, step take extremely quickly. and certain work hundred people across europe discus need done. spiegel: but certain decision take now? draghi: if urgent action need we’ll fast-track procedure give council commission 24 hour decide proposal board resolution mechanism. if don’t decide bank face liquidation, enough pressure find solution. spiegel: what condition european bank in? draghi: to find out, closely examine balance sheet bank come year. no conclusive judgement reach prior that. but bank system much good position four year ago. since then, around €0.5 trillion fresh capital flow euro area bank many institution change business models. what also certain almost bank operate much profitably low costs. spiegel: you paint positive picture euro area, many german policy-makers remain critical ecb policy. how much long conflict bundesbank president jens weidmann go on? draghi: i would rather speak convergence conflict. our position clearly move close cooperation improved. take recent interest rate reduction, bundesbank president jens weidmann initially reservations, say step justified. i often say i great respect bundesbank institution mean germans. bi central bankers’ speech 5 spiegel: that sound rather like christmas harmony. some economist germany speak “club med” talk majority southern european govern council accuse copy inflation policy bank italy 1970s. draghi: there insinuate i help italy i’m italian. this doesn’t affect me. i prove often enough i adhere

exit speech mr deepak mohanty, executive director reserve bank india, reserve bank staff college (rbsc), chennai, 26 december 2013. * * * the assistance provide binod b. bhoi rajeev jain preparation paper acknowledged. accompany chart also find reserve bank india’s website: http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_ viewspeeches.aspx i thank principal uma subramaniam opportunity interact unconventional monetary policy. the seminar topical timely. it 5 year since collapse lehman brother september 2008, evoke unprecedented monetary policy activism – conventional unconventional – across advance emerge market economy (emes). it first time december 18, 2013 u feed announce concrete measure exit unconventional monetary policy calibrate manner start january 2014. the indian economy like emes affect global financial crisis post-lehman announcement likely exit u feed may 2013. we also resort conventional unconventional policy response crisis also announcement exit, though qualitative difference responses. against backdrop, i begin distinguish unconventional monetary policy conventional policy, highlight contour unconventional policy major advance economy review impact policies. i turn impact india monetary policy response. i end draw broad conclusions. conventional unconventional monetary policy conventional monetary policy understand central bank operate short-term policy interest rate money market signal stance monetary policy process influence term structure market interest rate achieve objective price stability sustainable growth. price stability end itself. price stability, define low stable inflation, consider prerequisite sustainable growth medium-term. it believe trade-off growth inflation medium-term. even country choose inflation target framework try stabilise output around potential inflation around target level. hence, normally event shock either parameter drift targets, objective bring back target medium-term. however, conventional monetary policy limit condition “zero low bond”. for example, event extreme shock, happen global financial crisis, policy rate bring close zero, monetary stimulus possible conventional monetary policy. when central bank look beyond traditional instrument policy interest rate, monetary policy take unconventional character. it essentially mean use quantity instrument expand balance sheet central bank. it take different forms: quantitative ease (qe) direct long-term asset purchase central bank, credit ease (ce) central bank directly intervene particular segment credit market. both qe ce accompany dilution collateral standard central bank expand list collateral beyond traditional preference low risk sovereign bonds. unconventional monetary policy invariably accompany forward guidance regard future path monetary policy work expectation channel. this efficacy asset purchase programme depend behaviour market participant 2 bi central bankers’ speech financial entities. it likely market participant may alter behaviour without know central bank future regard instruments. in event crisis, unusual central bank expand balance sheets. the great receive wisdom central bank lender last resort (lolr) function base bagehot principle that, “the central bank lend freely good collateral penal rate”1. in fact, many early central bank include u feed institute largely discharge function. monetary policy understand today alien then. it different matter recent global financial crisis test limit bagehot principle never before. contour unconventional monetary policy let turn u fed, european central bank (ecb), bank england (boe) bank japan (boj) unveil unconventional monetary policies. i may mention boj use unconventional monetary policy much early japan go prolong deflation late 1990s. the global financial crisis erupt collapse major financial institution advance economy unprecedented scale. not lead sharp decline asset prices, freeze credit markets, loss confidence build block financial system, impact magnify quick transmission economy well. monetary authority advance economy first resort aggressive monetary ease first reduce policy rates. however, key channel conventional monetary policy severely impair crisis policy rate advance economy approach zero low bind (chart 1). 1 bagehot walter (1873), lombard street: a description money market, king &co., london; reprint wiley, new york 1999. bi central bankers’ speech 3 take cognisance severity crisis concern economic recession, central bank use balance sheet unconventional way augment liquidity (table 1). the qe programme initially attempt alleviate financial market distress, purpose soon broaden include achieve inflation targets, stimulate real economy, contain european sovereign debt crisis (fawley neely, 2013)2. now let u discus little rationale unconventional policy undertake across major economies. table 1 2 fawley, brett w. christopher j. neely (2013 ), “four story quantitative easing”, federal reserve bank st. louis review, january/february, vol. 95, no. 1. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in us, immediately collapse lehman brothers, slow growth high unemployment emerge major concerns, feed announce policy quantitative ease (qe) november 2008. the first two round qes reactivate financial markets, fail spur growth. under “operation twist” institute september 2011, feed take initiative buy longer-term treasury simultaneously sell shorter-dated security bring long-term interest rate continue till december 2012. with view put place strong version qe, launch qe3 september 2012. under qe3, feed start purchase us$85 billion fixed-income security per month. the feed intend keep qe3 effect unemployment fall 6.5 per cent inflation rise 2.5 per cent. in addition qe3, feed give forward guidance would keep short-term rate low 2015. a economic parameter show improvement, feed start talk exit, popularly know taper bond buy may 2013. subsequently, announce slow pace bond buy program us$ 10 billion per month january 2014. in uk, reduce policy rate (i.e., bank rate) 0.5 per cent march 2009, bank england (boe) start asset purchase programme consist almost exclusively government bond non-bank private sector. subsequently, fund lend scheme (fls) put place july 2012 aim incentivising bank build society boost lend uk real economy3. japan’s economy deteriorate nearly 15 year threat deflation. to overcome deflation, bank japan (boj) engage wide range monetary ease effort − include implementation zero interest rate policy, quantitative ease policy comprehensive monetary easing, easily derive concrete results4. follow crisis, boj embark ambitious asset purchase program combat deflation. in october 2012, announce purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), commercial paper, corporate bonds, exchange trade fund (etf), japanese real estate investment trust (j-reits). in april 2013, boj announce quantitative qualitative monetary ease program purchase jgbs, etf j-reits goal increase monetary base 60–70 trillion jpy annually, increase average maturity jgbs hold three seven year meet 2 per cent inflation target two years. in euro area, concern counter-party risk eventually lead dry interbank lend early 2009. the european central bank (ecb) respond may 2009, reduce main refinance rate 1 per cent introduce 12-month ltros cover bond purchase program (cbpp). the ecb substantially extend liquidity provision offer unlimited longer-term refinance operations. the ecb also purchase security outright distress market security market program (smp), was, however, late replace pledge intervene decisively outright monetary transaction (omts). the unconventional measure undertake involve extraordinary central bank lending, expand central bank balance sheet substantially (chart 2). we learn text book inflation experience 1970s sharp increase base money could inflationary. on contrary, current episode inflation decline target level many advance countries. 3 bank england (2012), “the fund lend scheme”, quarterly bulletin 2012 q4. 4 kuroda, haruhiko (2013), “quantitative qualitative monetary easing”, speech meet hold yomiuri international economic society tokyo, april 12. bi central bankers’ speech 5 partly explanation lie fact despite increase size balance sheets, broad money supply expand significantly. this due perceptible decline money multiplier account bank build cash reserve risk averse conserve require capital rather lend real economy (chart 3). moreover, interest rate near zero level, opportunity cost hold money money hold sector also fell. another interest explanation inflation expectation remain well anchored, mean economic entity believe inflation go go up. further, economy operate capacity scope inflation wage increase there. while consumer price inflation may rise short run, cannot presume asset price inflation go give excess liquidity. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the large scale economic downturn accompany financial crisis also lead activation counter-cyclical fiscal policy unprecedented magnitude. the fiscal measure focus improve balance sheet financial corporate sector reflect large scale bailouts u advance economies. reflect fiscal stimulus measures, advance economy witness significant deterioration fiscal position reflect high public debt gdp ratio (chart 4). let turn experience emes. experience emes initially, view emes would remain insulate global financial meltdown back significant buff build years, include substantial foreign exchange reserves, improve policy framework generally robust bank sector corporate balance sheets. however, crisis deepen follow failure lehman brother result heighten risk aversion global deleveraging, emes also affect vary degrees. the contagion global financial crisis also warrant swift monetary fiscal policy response emes view ensure orderly function markets, preserve financial stability, moderate adverse effect growth. in process, policy response become synchronise global effort (mohanty, 2011)5. while develop economy emes resort conventional unconventional monetary measures, certain difference term timing, type magnitudes. first, advance economy switchover conventional monetary tool unconventional measure due policy rate approach zero, many emes, unconventional foreign exchange ease domestic liquidity augment measure 5 mohanty, deepak (2011), “lessons monetary policy global financial crisis: an emerge market perspective”, rbi bulletin, april. bi central bankers’ speech 7 precede conventional measure policy rate cuts. second, central bank emes rely mostly direct instrument reserve requirement ease domestic liquidity, central bank advance country resort various liquidity provide operation relaxation counter-parties, collateral maturity. third, central bank advance country extensively use credit quantitative ease measure lead large expansion balance sheet unlike emes. fourth, advance economy fiscal support aim rescue financial sector crisis situation, emes generally mean address deficiency aggregate demand. let turn consequence unconventional policy. impact unconventional policy a unconventional monetary policy measure undertake keep view domestic economies, attendant increase global liquidity appear impact range asset class advance emerge economy (chart 5). there study find significant impact qe. they suggest reduction u treasury yield around 100 basis points, corporate bond yield 80 basis points, reduction range 20–80 basis point advance economies6. in case emes, evidence suggest high capital inflow pressure, rapid domestic credit growth domestic inflationary pressures. 6 chen, q., a. filardo, d. he f. zhu (2012), “international spillover central bank balance sheet policies”, bi paper no. 66. 8 bi central bankers’ speech furthermore, indication possible withdrawal since talk u taper may 2013 cause volatility financial market emes impact currency valuation capital retreat back u anticipation high interest rates. emes, particularly large current account fiscal deficits, severely impacted. let turn experience crisis, talk taper. indian experience crisis policy exit until emergence global crisis, india experience phase high growth along low stable inflation. growth largely drive high domestic demand – grow domestic investment finance mostly domestic save sustain consumption demand. sequential financial sector reforms, rule-based fiscal policy forward look monetary policy together contribute overall improve macroeconomic performance. bi central bankers’ speech 9 follow emergence crisis, india, initially remain somewhat insulate global developments, eventually impact significantly channel – financial, real importantly, confidence channel (subbarao, 2009)7. this could attribute global nature crisis one hand accelerate trade financial integration indian economy world other. the impact crisis first visible india’s financial market form tighten liquidity high volatility market segment along sharp decline stock prices. risk aversion part global investor result moderation capital inflow exchange rate depreciation. credit growth decelerate reflect weaken business confidence. growth, already cyclical moderation first half 2008–09, decelerate significantly second half. a result, growth decline 6.7 per cent 2008–09 precede 5-year average 8.7 per cent per annum (table 2). table 2 restore normalcy financial markets, ensure normal flow credit productive sector economy well limit adverse impact real sector economy assume policy priority. the reserve bank, like central banks, take number conventional unconventional measure limit adverse impact contagion indian financial market economy. these include augment domestic foreign exchange liquidity sharp reduction policy rate. the reserve bank use multiple instrument liquidity adjustment facility (laf), open market operation (omo), cash reserve ratio (crr) security market stabilisation scheme (mss) augment liquidity system. these measure support fiscal stimulus package raise fiscal deficit central government 3.5 per cent gdp 6.0 per cent 2008–09 (chart 6). 7 subbarao, d. (2009), “impact global financial crisis india: collateral damage response”, speech deliver symposium “the global economic crisis challenge asian economy change world” organise institute international monetary affairs, tokyo, february 18. 10 bi central bankers’ speech on back substantial monetary fiscal stimulus, growth bounce back quickly. however, inflation also pick up. consequently, policy focus shift exit accommodative monetary policy calibrate manner start october 2009. to begin special liquidity measure withdraw follow hike policy rate. a real policy rate turn positive start impact inflation. go financial year 2012–13, growth decline headline wpi inflation show clear sign moderation. this prompt reserve bank reduce policy rate (chart 7). bi central bankers’ speech 11 a economic condition appear stabilising, volatility financial market return follow announcement may 2013 fed’s intention likely taper qe. this prompt reserve bank resort somewhat unconventional monetary policy measure besides draw foreign exchange reserve meet immediate shortfall (chart 8). let give flavour key measures. • in term monetary policy, upper bind policy rate corridor (i.e., msf rate) raise 200 basis point quantity central bank liquidity available laf window restrained. this desire effect tighten monetary condition raise effective policy rate sharply msf rate. • in order signal measure temporary interest rate long end harden form operation twist try conduct outright omo purchase government security alongside sale short-term government cash management bills. this invert yield curve, though accompany increase long-term rates. • with view contain current account deficit (cad) balance payment (bop), gold import restricted. • the non-resident deposit scheme banks’ borrow abroad liberalise incentive swap inflow directly reserve bank. this substantially augment foreign exchange reserve despite outflow account directly meet foreign exchange requirement oil imports. a portfolio capital outflow wan bop improved, stability return foreign exchange market. this prompt reserve bank unwind bulk exceptional measure normalise monetary policy restore policy interest rate corridor original position repo rate signal role policy. though policy repo rate increase 25 basis point september november 2013, consideration emerge growth inflation balance. 12 bi central bankers’ speech conclusion let conclude. first, global financial crisis trigger unprecedented policy activism advance country central banks. they resort unconventional monetary policy nature scale unthinkable hitherto. second, complete 5 year unconventional monetary policy qe ce, question is: succeed? while early say, opinion remain divided. thus far, unconventional policies, central bank far le successful stimulate growth8. while may improve general monetary transmission prompt sustainable recovery, significant impact financial market. the counterfactual would happen without qe known? in case, seem prevent deep recession. third, spillover effect qe commodity market emerge market economy (emes) significant. this result increase volatility capital flow elevate asset prices. the initiation exit qe also create additional macroeconomic challenge emes include india. fourth, indian economy financial market significantly impact global financial crisis recent signal exit qe fed. this prompt reserve bank resort conventional unconventional monetary policy alongside regulatory policy stabilise markets. finally, exit qe increase uncertainty financial market, increasingly felt continuation unconventional monetary policy long could create risk global economy seek address prevent deleveraging appropriate price risks. in addition, current policy response increase sovereign risk number country circumscribe ability policy cushion unexpected shocks. thank you. 8 rajan, raghuram (2013), “a step dark: unconventional monetary policy crisis”, andrew crockett memorial lecture deliver bi

* * the assistance provide p.k. nayak, s. suraj s. nath acknowledged. i happy picturesque state mizoram, land roll hills, valleys, river lakes. the state strategic location share much border bangladesh myanmar. it cover 0.6 per cent national geographic area account 0.1 per cent national population. with second high literacy rate country, state great potential economic development. access finance important prerequisite economic development. in recent year reserve bank india (rbi) pursue objective financial inclusion renew vigour. some progress achieve mile go. governor dr. raghuram g. rajan emphasise financial inclusion one five pillar rbi’s financial development plank : “… expand access finance small medium enterprises, unorganised sector, poor, remote underserved area country, though technology, new business practice new organisational structure.”1 financial inclusion pose additional challenge north-eastern state give relatively low level bank penetration inadequate infrastructure. against background, i briefly delineate economic financial structure state, highlight financial inclusion initiative conclude think policy challenge way forward. economic structure india experience accelerate gdp growth rate 2000s. obviously, growth experience share many states. in line national economy, mizoram also experience pick growth. even growth momentum national level dent follow onset global financial crisis 2007–08, performance mizoram’s economy good even post-crisis period. consequently, share mizoram’s gross state domestic product (gsdp) all-india gdp rise 0.08 per cent 2006–07 0.10 per cent 2011–12 (chart 1). 1 “the five pillar rbi’s financial sector policies”, speech governor raghuram g. rajan bancon 2013 hold mumbai november 15, 2013. rbi monthly bulletin, december 2013. 2 bi central bankers’ speech all three major sector economy – agriculture, industry service – contribute improve growth performance state. there was, however, significant year-to-year fluctuation sectoral growth rates. while variation agricultural growth understandable weather dependent, volatility industrial growth need close attention, give low industrial base state (chart 2). the sectoral composition mizoram economy broadly change line national economy decline share agriculture increase share services. while share industry pick up, remain significantly national average underscore scope industrialisation (chart 3). bi central bankers’ speech 3 the significant impact growth improvement per caput net state domestic product (nsdp) ₹26,308 2006–07 ₹39,546 2011–12 2004–05 prices, despite large decadal population growth rate 22.8 per cent, high rate growth 17.6 per cent national level. notably, per caput income mizoram 4.0 per cent high correspond average national per caput income 2011–12 (chart 4). it worthwhile note economy mizoram, line national trend, get increasingly dominate industry service sectors, labour force still concentrate agricultural sector (table 1). therefore, create employment opportunity manufacture service sector become important. 4 bi central bankers’ speech table 1 share employment broad industry group a high proportion work age (ages 15–59) population rural mizoram compare rural india provide favourable condition growth (chart 5). but happen, industry service sector increasingly provide employment opportunity. bi central bankers’ speech 5 social indicator with great urbanisation high literacy, indicator human development mizoram good national average (chart 6). share household access basic amenity like electricity, television, computers, telephone four wheeler significantly high mizoram national average (table 2). on hand, proportion population access bank facilities, although improve decade 2001–2011, national level. this policy challenge context development increase emphasis financial inclusion. 6 bi central bankers’ speech table 2 standard life indicators: mizoram india state finance mizoram one 11 special category state characterise low resource base cost disability due geography, sparse terrain remoteness. in order overcome inadequacies, centre accord special consideration devolve resource central pool. the revenue account mizoram show significant improvement follow rule-based fiscal policy mizoram frbm act 2006. however, correction revenue account largely account high transfer centre, since tax revenue continue remain around 2.3 per cent gsdp. from perspective growth employment, key concern decline capital outlay term gsdp (table 3). bi central bankers’ speech 7 table 3 fiscal position mizoram bank development the bank sector penetration mizoram may see context special characteristic difficult terrain economic structure. agriculture characterise hill mountain cultivation industry dominate micro small units. the population per bank branch mizoram decline 11,400 june 2001 9,100 june 2013 thus much low all-india average 11,800 (chart 7) reflect good coverage bank services. 8 bi central bankers’ speech however, credit-deposit (c-d) ratio remain significantly low all-india average (chart 8). moreover, c-d ratio mizoram decline recent years. it could partly deposit grow faster. the annual deposit growth rate mizoram significantly high national average. however, credit growth rate fall short national average 2007–08 (chart 9). this underscore need deep analysis credit information: be lack demand lack supply constrain credit flow? bi central bankers’ speech 9 the low credit flow also mirror credit gdp ratio another measure financial deepening. the credit-gsdp ratio mizoram improve modestly 13.7 per cent 2004–05 18.7 per cent 2011–12, compare increase 39.0 per cent 57.3 per cent national level (chart 10). financial inclusion the reserve bank commit financial inclusion (fi) bank service touch every section society. it imperative bring poor under-privileged section population bank fold inclusive growth development. in regard, reserve bank adopt structure approach towards financial inclusion predominantly bank-led model leverage appropriate technology, change mode delivery increase financial literacy. in context, i may highlight four key elements. first, ensure branch expansion rural area give full freedom bank open branch villages. in fact, recently branch authorisation policy fully liberalise subject bank open least 25 per cent branch rural areas. in addition, reserve bank enable commercial bank operate business correspondent (bcs) thus take bank door step rural areas. second, provide universal coverage facilitate direct benefit transfer (dbt) leverage aadhar identification, bank advise draw financial inclusion plan (fips) period 2013–16 great emphasis open branch unbanked rural centres. third, provision suitable financial product aim towards vulnerable section population no-frill account, credit general credit card (gcc) kisan credit card (kcc). moreover, know your customer (kyc) norm require open bank account relax especially rural under-privileged population. finally, effort make towards spread financial literacy include internet base curriculum financial literacy school organise financial literacy camps. 10 bi central bankers’ speech in direction, bank cover unbanked village population 2,000. the second phase movement aim achieve target financial inclusion 4,90,000 village population le 2,000. the identify village allot various bank ensure availability least one bank outlet village. the detail achievement recent financial inclusion drive summarise table 4. table 4 progress make financial inclusion plan progress financial inclusion mizoram keep mind topographic challenge locational disadvantage development extensive bank outreach, bank advise adopt special measure fi north-eastern region india. since december 2009, domestic schedule commercial bank country, exclude rrbs, permit open branch location region without take permission reserve bank. let turn specifically progress financial inclusion mizoram. bi central bankers’ speech 11 a part financial inclusion plan (fip) adopt mizoram, unbanked village state population 2,000 cover bank facility end-march 2012. another 700 village population 2,000 already identified. out villages, 106 propose cover brick mortar model rest would cover business correspondence (bc) model. a end-september 2013, 2, 27,812 basic save bank deposit account (bsbdas) mizoram, another 10,777 account overdraft facility target open year 2013–14. in addition, 11,642 kcc gcc target provide household 2013–14. out 8 district state, far 5 financial literacy centre (flcs) opened. a end-september 2013 cumulatively 3,063 self help group (shgs) credit-linked provide total credit ₹1,650 lakh. policy challenge mizoram economy perform well recent years. however, keep view young population high literacy strategic location, considerable scope growth development. let conclude draw attention challenges. first, dominant feature hill mountain farm mizoram slop marginal farmland rain-fed farming. subsistence farm land pervasive. expansion land cultivation environmentally sustainable manner may limited. the emphasis agriculture, therefore, may shift towards high value add horticulture tremendous potential. this also require great penetration credit agriculture. second, industrial development mizoram start late 1990s, mainly attain statehood. the industrial landscape dominate micro small industries. there need reinforce process facilitate access market formal credit. third, weak market linkage rest india couple lack good quality road absence railway network inhibit effective market goods. therefore, priority give development infrastructure, especially road also provision post harvest management, cold storage process facilities. there also need harness hydro-power capacity. good accessibility also help develop service sector, particularly tourism, could become significant source employment revenue. finally, topography state infrastructure bottleneck together work deterrent development physical bank financial infrastructure. hence, great reliance may need place technology make bank accessible majority population. this require improvement telecommunication facility. i thank invite share think financial inclusion state. tomorrow, i hope see outreach programme tanhril village. with combine effort state administration, bank reserve bank could together make significant impact financial inclusion. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ajith nivard cabraal: harmonize fiscal monetary policy deliver

h.a.s. samaraweera, auditor general; deputy governor colleague central bank; vice president council member ca sri lanka; mr. n. r. gajendran, chairman, member tax faculty ca sri lanka; mr. esmond satarasinghe; fellow charter accountants; member business community; my dear friends, at outset, let thank ca sri lanka invite deliver 18th annual oration taxation organize faculty taxation ca sri lanka. i consider deeply privilege unique opportunity. i please topic oration, “harmonizing fiscal monetary policy deliver sustainable growth stability” one relevant timely, since large number global national development regularly underscore vital importance harmonization monetary fiscal policy country well regions. monetary policy fiscal policy in order set backdrop today’s oration, let initially provide brief insight monetary policy fiscal policy entails. monetary policy mean central bank seek achieve macro-economic stability. in sri lanka, authority responsible formulation implementation monetary policy central bank sri lanka. the monetary law act no.58 1949 legislation central bank (cb) established, provide wide range instrument could use central bank monetary management. development economy financial system lead gradual evolution objectives, framework conduct monetary policy. in 2002, amendment monetary law act no. 58 1949, objective central bank 2 bi central bankers’ speech re-defined “economic price stability” “financial system stability”, view encourage promote development productive resource sri lanka. fiscal policy framework implement government order influence economic activity via allocation resource towards achieve overall goal stability growth. this policy framework mainly implement ministry finance (mof) sri lanka, traditional policy tool use purpose taxation, government expenditure & borrowing, debt management. in meantime, would also note finance budget debt management monetary implications, composition debt instruments, time debt issue maturities, close relationship fiscal monetary implications. we need understand fiscal policy broad taxation. therefore, perhaps next post-budget seminar institute attempt convey position popular misconception amongst many charter accountant “fiscal policy taxation” removed, thereby encourage accountant focus fundamental fiscal philosophy implementation method important pre post-budget seminars. needle say, great appreciation entirety fiscal policy would enable charter accountant pay attention wide range subject encompass fiscal policy, accountants’ knowledge idea field could regularly harness benefit country large. mr. chairman, may reasonably easy define monetary policy fiscal policy means, would easy define whose purview policy would fall into, come implementation. of course, clear bulk monetary policy would direct responsibility central bank, bulk fiscal policy would responsibility ministry finance. however, several grey area overlaps, blur boundary policy frameworks, therefore, many instance policy action one institution impact influence upon policy framework other, vice versa. relationship central bank ministry finance with mind, let u examine relationship central bank ministry finance structure accord laws. mr. chairman, i already stated, basic law govern operation monetary board central bank, monetary law act no.58 1949. the monetary law act, (popularly call mla), cover power purpose central bank, monetary board, governor deputy governors, department central bank, report publications, profit loss account bank etc. in addition, chapter devote power purpose central bank, national monetary policy, instrument central bank, central bank’s relationship government. what perhaps relevant today’s discussion mla define central bank’s relationship government. towards end, careful examination mla well john exter’s “report establishment central bank ceylon” november 1949, (popularly call exter report), provide useful insight objective background one important piece legislation country. at stage, quick introduction john exter may also relevant. john exter senior official federal reserve system second service late 1948, government ceylon u government, advise government ceylon organization function reserve bank ceylon, frame proposal draft constitution reserve bank ceylon. exter brilliant banker scholar, fulfil mission thereafter appoint first governor central bank ceylon 1950. john exter’s report, serf important bi central bankers’ speech 3 authoritative reference central banker sri lanka, refer often academic practitioner central banking, whenever clarification require issue relate central bank sri lanka. get back topic, analysis mla reveal? in view, interest positions: first: the mla design ensure central bank function independent body, high degree autonomy fashion implement policies, far reach implication people. mr. chairman, let cite first paragraph exter report deal significance central bank system. i quote: “the decision government ceylon establish central bank decision far reach implication people ceylon. one implication already stand clearly: take step establish independent monetary system administer central bank, government demonstrate unmistakably intention achieve genuine economic freedom corollary political freedom achieve year half ago.” have set stage, exter go elaborate responsibility undertake central bank: “a central bank thus undertake great responsibility, broad power give central bank ceylon draft bill part ii report commensurate magnitude responsibility. the bank hamper rigid limitation might prevent fulfil purpose.” second: exter report need central bank function context agency government. he reports, i quote: “under draft law, central bank principal monetary authority, obvious cannot exercise authority monetary field water-tight compartment, various ministry agency government, excluded. there fine line separate monetary policy policies, fiscal trade policies. the minister finance fiscal policy, minister commerce trade authority control import exports, exert powerful influence upon monetary condition ceylon. but clear intent bill concentrate, far consider practicable constitutional do, much monetary authority responsibility possible single regulatory operate agency – central bank”. third: the monetary law act (chapter 6) envisage central bank act fiscal agent, banker financial advisor government. section 106, 113, 114 set clearly central bank’s role relation management public debt borrow government agency government. those section read follows: “section 106. (1) the central bank shall act fiscal agent banker government agency institution act behalf government, whether establish write law otherwise.” “section 113. the central bank shall, agent government, responsible management public debt.” “section 114. no new loan shall raise new issue stock debenture shall make government agency institution refer subsection (1) section 106, whether pursuance authority confer write law otherwise, unless advice monetary board first obtain upon monetary implication propose loan issue.” 4 bi central bankers’ speech the exter report elaborate think behind sections: “in small country like ceylon, clearly advantageous place responsibility coordinate activity government credit institution monetary board central bank. the board determine monetary credit policy general, mean ensure policy credit institution conform.” he clarifies: “the board able coordinate borrow lend investment operation institutions. with respect borrowing, co-ordination necessary order prevent separate government agency compete ‘spoiling’ market, especially early stage development, make possible formulation properly diversify pattern interest rate maturity entire government borrow program.” those section mla i refer to, relevant annotation exter’s report, strongly suggest central bank play dynamic role formulation fiscal policy, particularly relation significant part fiscal policy’s sphere influence, namely borrow lending. in context, may safely argue that, whilst overwhelm responsibility monetary policy assume central bank, sizeable part responsibility relation fiscal policy also cast upon central bank. fourth: exter explain unique position governor, need governor independent. this position assure fact governor appoint 6 year term cannot remove office, unless do act, opinion governor general, (now, president), fraudulent illegal character, interest central bank. fifth: exter discus limitation central bank: once again, let quote: “a central bank influence economic life nation principally monetary action. while action tremendously effective certain conditions, limitation frankly recognized. thus, control money central bank assist, mean ensure, achievement objects. a monetary system stable time responsive need grow country necessary, sufficient condition orderly economic development.” sixth: exter report vital importance harmonize government policy central bank policies. here, exter’s comment unambiguous far reaching. i quote: “there are, however, many important problem monetary policy, especially relate fiscal policy, central bank must necessarily work close harmony government. on problems, experience many country show central bank, degree independence government proper, make economic analysis hold view detach objective government department. many government learn value use sort independent objective advice monetary aspect economic policy central bank able give. on matter vital interest state, however, must recognize that… would impossible central bank adopt policy pursue course action contrary policy government day. no agency creature government entirely independent government. while government may prepare give independent regulatory agency rather wide discretion field money, gain-saying that, last analysis, government must assume responsibility monetary policy policies. the governor appoint member monetary board cannot help acutely conscious fact that, since parliament bind successors, independence tenure office bi central bankers’ speech 5 propose legislation limit ultimate power government change law.” exter also make useful observation: “the exact degree independence central bank likely vary time time. for example, central bank ordinarily act independently stable, peace-time economic conditions, time war national emergency. they also tend take strong stand issue primarily monetary character, relate issue may simply monetary repercussions”. seventh: exter describe ideal situation contemplate mla. i quote again: “the ideal hop propose law achieve one continuous constructive co-operation monetary board government. the principal instrument achieve co-operation permanent secretary ministry finance, whose membership board ensure times, minister’s view make know member board. the effectiveness cooperation co-ordination board government depend upon men occupy key position particular time upon legal formula, matter carefully elaborately might work out. a relationship complex, sometimes delicate, one certain be, cannot establish full-blown piece legislation. it must result, countries, year experience slow growth political conventions.” a read understand exter annotation clearly indicate delicate complex nature envisage relationship two vital institutions, men (or women!) occupy key positions. it would also observe exter suggesting, mla legislating, somewhat paradoxical situation. on one hand, (now, i speak like traditional economist!), central bank must exercise high degree independence, while, hand, central bank must act harmonization policy government! it course obvious paradox unintentional, has, fact, carefully think deliberately introduced, obviously do order establish extremely vital far reach principle. that is, need central bank retain intellectual operational independence, temper pragmatism national deliverable economic agenda decide democratically elect government. go further, exter’s comment “the effectiveness cooperation coordination board government depend upon men occupy key position particular times, upon legal formula”, emphasize complexity delicateness relationship, describe lucid clever language. mr. chairman, all position i describe highlight another important fundamental principle set exter’s central bank report 1949. that is, exter’s wise word “good central bank le good law good practice”. after 7 year governor, i tell one wise comment exter report, appreciation principle must understand stakeholders, especially current turbulent times, sri lanka fast track economic development. in fact, past several decades, monetary policy objectives, instrument operate mechanism change significantly. today, aftermath global financial crisis, key focus central bank successful conduct monetary policy macroprudential policy, order reinforce stabilize economies. in sri lanka too, monetary policy formulation, operational framework strategy adopted, evolve line change structure economy, development financial markets, availability data communication strategies. i intend discus 6 bi central bankers’ speech change detail here, would like highlight great coordination monetary fiscal policy would become even crucial implementation monetary policy achieve macroeconomic stability, future past. another position clear u need harmonization central bank ministry finance, virtue suggest recently, vital ingredient provide for, since establishment central bank, order ensure sound economic management country. the recent evolution economy arm background, i would like proceed share you, instance harmonization take place recent past country. however, i that, i think necessary first touch upon recent evolution economy order set stage would follow. to so, let u initially examine snap shoot economy 2005. growth 2005 6.2%, average growth 7 years, 1999 2005, 4.3%; foreign reserve around us$ 2.7 billion, equivalent 2 ½ month imports; the country mercy ruthless terrorist group brink war; unemployment 7.2%; poverty level 15%; inflation sharp rise trend; the bank system vulnerable display several worrisome cracks; public debt gdp level exceed 90%; per caput income us$1,250; gdp around us$24 billion; the western province share gdp overwhelm 51%; infrastructure development almost non-existent; the fiscal deficit 7% although little infrastructure development work carry out. all all, rather bleak picture, bad still, bleak outlook. let u see like today: growth 7%, average growth 2006 2012 6.7%; growth appear course reach around 8% level next year; foreign reserve exceed us$ 6.3 billion around 4.4 month imports; the country enjoy peaceful stable conditions; foreign investment inflow strong foreign investment via international sovereign bond government paper amount us$7.0 billion; unemployment around 3.6%; poverty 6% mark; inflation single digit level past 4 ½ years; gdp us$60 billion; per caput income around us$ 3,000; the economy diversify 5hub + tourism strategy avoid middle income trap; the fiscal deficit limit 6.4% 2012, reduce trend; the debt gdp level 80% falling; the level infrastructure improve tremendously; the do business global rank 81st, poise jump 10 place year; regional development make tangible progress western province share gdp drop around 43%; regular foreign investment flow bank stock market; private remittance reach nearly 10% gdp, us$ 6 billion actual inflows; the bank system stable even midst difficult global circumstances, country enjoy favourable review many influential international quarters. mr. chairman, dispassionate comparison condition prevail 2006 2013 tell u economy make unprecedented transformation past 7 years, strong economic growth, stable macro-economic conditions. harmonization monetary fiscal policy – case study the discussion point arise is, factors, process condition contribute current level growth stability. of course, aware many factor contribute current state affair country, could subject of, maybe 50 orations! but, today’s discussion, let u confine bi central bankers’ speech 7 examine background significant initiative would influence current state economy, understand present day outcome support and/or impact harmonization fiscal monetary policies. one strike feature implementation monetary fiscal policy past 7 years, institutions, mof cb take keen endure interest monetary fiscal policies. we realize “blame game” would value country stakeholders, absolutely vital deliver front simultaneously. mr. chairman, say that, discus case study would throw light degree harmonization take place policy central bank ministry finance, order deliver vital result country economy, past 7 years. case study 1: open sri lanka treasury bill bond foreign investor mr. chairman, first case study i would like cite november 2006 move open sri lanka treasury bill bond foreign investors. by late 2006, sri lanka, massive infrastructure development programme launched, critical humanitarian operation begun. these twin programme demand regular, steady massive flow funds, become increasingly clear would able secure new fund requirement via local tax local borrowing. if quantum fund source within, enormous pressure would exert upon entire economy. in fact, attempt would push interest rate unacceptable levels, may even drag economy towards negative territory, place entire monetary system considerable risk. such fear may perhaps one reason prompt successive government past, avoid large scale infrastructure development programme attempt launch full scale counter action programme terrorism. however, government president mahinda rajapaksa take bold decision undertake missions, fiscal monetary authority find innovative way support missions, without place economy undue risk peril. a response therefore, late 2006, treasury central bank decide open small portion government treasury bill bond foreign investors. this first move attract foreign investment government rupee paper, naturally fresh excite experience sri lankan authority well foreign investors. you may note i said, “foreign investment”, “foreign direct investment” fdi. that because, view, vital “foreign investment” allow flow convenient instrument supplement shortfall save investment country’s economic structure, inflow need necessarily via fdi. the move result new quick inflows, result, debt management become dynamic robust. it also provide new tool address wide fluctuation interest rate take place country, prior move. this initiative course necessitate close cooperation follow mof cb, particularly result significant infusion forex country need properly manage point view central bank. in retrospect, i also state important move enable economy face emerge challenge time confidently, new inflow assist government maintain growth momentum, also allow central bank maintain stability. one important lesson would take away case study initiative implement result close harmonization mof central bank. have one two agency fully support bold imaginative move, initiative would failed, bad still, still-born. 8 bi central bankers’ speech case study 2: debut international sovereign bond the second case study i would describe even debut international sovereign bond sri lanka, 2007. mr. chairman, may recollect, second half 2007, country fully engage major humanitarian operation, global environment become unstable. the local environment also tense, notwithstanding efforts. inflation high; interest rate high; exchange rate threat; fiscal deficit expand rapidly, ever increase need finance fund massive infrastructure development programme meet cost humanitarian operation. to deal challenge situation, mof cb decide vital sizeable injection long term foreign fund give economy. it infusion would allow u maintain stability, well able much need fund keep infrastructure development effort going. some financially savvy member opposition too, realize significance fund infusion economy, try utmost scuttle effort. but, fortunately, able defeat endeavours, raise important bond, tide risky period. the infusion new fund immediately bring stability economy also act important stimulus growth, new additional resource quickly filter economy. hence, result move, fiscal framework support moderation interest rates; monetary framework facilitate stabilization prices; exchange rate support buttress international reserves. mr. chairman, i believe that, day sri lanka’s economic history written, 2007 infusion us$ 500 million international sovereign bond, would mark major “turning point” economic landscape. i also believe benefit land mark move endure permanent nature, evidence fact that, next 5 ½ years, government able raise us$3 ½ billion international bonds, coupon rate tighten considerably year. another benefit initiative entailed, pave way several bank corporates also issue international bonds, thereby access save outside country. by that, also able bridge chronic savings/investment gap regularly refer never end stream expert since independence, major deficiency hamper growth economy. case study 3: intervention stabilize systemically important bank the third case study i would like illustrate instance central bank ministry finance team stabilize systemically important bank face liquidity crisis late 2008/early 2009. mr. chairman, if take mind back period, late 2008, would recollect external environment, internationally locally, become even hostile highly uncertain. internationally, global financial crisis take major toll, hundred bank collapse across world. each day, hear collapse imminent failure many big name global financial landscape. in many countries, minister finance governor central bank huddle endless discussion do arrest crises, stop bleeding. business go bankrupt thousands. business confidence level rock bottom. people part world panic. locally, humanitarian operation enter final critical stage, enormous pressure exert economy. in background, systemically important bank show sign liquidity crisis, know event, allow escalate, could drag economy chaos, humanitarian operation standstill. we act decisively, fast. we could bi central bankers’ speech 9 delay respond grave threat, get wrong. fortunately, central bank ready. we already develop bank intervention operation, code name “sigiriya”, deal situation liquidity crisis bank. the time come activate mission. but so, first step vital. that apprise minister finance obtain approval make intervention. if minister finance approve intervention, would first time ever, sri lanka, rescue operation attempted. at time, experience country period, encouraging. in many countries, include uk, (as case northern rock bank), finance minister governor central bank protract discussion many week type intervention, without reach agreement. fortunately sri lanka however, procrastination take place. the minister finance decisive, single “one-on-one” discussion me, give approval central bank proceed implementation intervention plan. the rest history. the newly appoint director manage agents, central bank background, able stabilize bank within short period 2 weeks. thereafter, within months, bank able infuse new capital thereby qualify exit close monitor system central bank, le year. this episode important lesson wish study way government central bank cooperate bring stability, face instability bank sector. it also confirm validity important annotation exter’s report. let quote first chapter report: “many (central bank’s) power may go unused long periods, design particular situations, may never arise. others intend use crisis forestall crisis, prudence dictate include now, hand case need. …”. case study 4: the creation present day “virtuous cycle” mr. chairman, i would like place you, yet another significant example harmonization monetary fiscal policies, lead creation new “virtuous cycle” relation inflation, interest rates, investor confidence sustain growth, country. a aware, sri lanka long trap “vicious cycle” high fiscal deficit lead high inflation; high inflation lead high interest rates; high interest rate lead low investor confidence; low investor confidence lead sluggish investment; sluggish investment lead low growth; low growth lead high debt; high debt lead high fiscal deficits. this vicious cycle trapped, 5 decade since independence. it true one-off spurt high growth short period low inflation various time history. however, acknowledge that, 2010 2011, never 8% growth consecutive years, or, matter, even able record average growth 5% 5 year period, prior 2006! at time, period february 2009, till now, sri lanka never enjoy period even two continuous year single digit inflation, and, believe not, level average inflation 12% prior that! what bad almost sense acceptance performance among many official mof cb, harbour internal view may country’s “karma” low growth, large fiscal deficit high inflation! in fact, many central bank official often hear lament continuous high fiscal deficit government push inflation grumble government never stop that. in turn, mof official use complain tight in-sensitive monetary policy cb root cause fiscal deficit always control! 10 bi central bankers’ speech it therefore clear change attitude change action vital. it also necessary make effective intervention change equilibrium vicious cycle, fresh equilibrium could created. le chatelier, famous french scientist introduce “equilibrium law” world 1898, teach u that, order disturb equilibrium, need disturb one component equilibrium. then, entire system move new equilibrium. so, key decision made, offend component vicious equilibrium disturb deal first. towards end, i remember, several “one-on-one” discussion secretary treasury, dr. p.b. jayasundera late 2006 early 2007, jointly decide important priority. base discussions, decide would take necessary initiative improve investor confidence ensure continuous investment via government local private sector, whilst specifically target new foreign investment. accordingly, many initiative implemented, comparatively short period time, effort start show results, country start record steady inflow foreign investment major government projects, investment treasury bill bonds, investment international sovereign bonds. this regular flow investment enable economy record sustain high growth, even whilst conflict raging. a consequence, sri lanka record average growth 6.7% 2006 2012, one difficult period history. in fact, growth level 2006: 7.7%, 2007: 6.8%, 2008: 6%, 2009: 3.5%, 2010: 8%, 2011: 8.2%, 2012: 6.4%, high ever seven year period history! that mean joint strategy pay off, sustain growth recorded. with sustain growth pipeline continuous investments, economy gradually transform stable level, that, key factor vicious cycle also begin change better. initially, certain critic believe would able escape vicious cycle trap country decades. they write newspaper give tv interview state initial success fluke sustainable. they warn economy would return vicious cycle again. they continue support argument many high sound theory hair-splitting formulas, dr. jayasundera i ridiculed, often describe villain responsible impend disaster. we regularly feature unflattering, nevertheless enjoyable cartoon well! but, today, mr. chairman, critic find increasingly difficult sustain criticism, face gradually emerge new equilibrium “virtuous cycle” new harmonize policy framework able generate. presently, even though minority stubbornly refuse see unfold eyes, new cycle take shape: low inflation lead real interest rates; real interest rate lead enhance savings; enhance save lead regular pipeline investment; regular investment lead low debt levels; low debt level lead sustain growth; sustain growth lead low inflation. what tell u able break free previous vicious cycle, place country virtuous cycle! the challenge therefore would carefully nurture guard new equilibrium, know fully well disturbance even one component could change situation adverse results. case study 5: the establishment deposit insurance scheme let illustrate yet another example harmonization. this relation establishment deposit insurance fund scheme. my colleague central bank tell discussion connection set deposit insurance scheme take place various times, past two decades! however, consensus reach suitable mechanism, bi central bankers’ speech 11 particularly large initial capital require establishment scheme, could allocate government many year due intense pressure upon need allocate fund press need state. nevertheless, consider vital fund scheme established, hence innovative method structured, without place additional burden upon government coffers. in 2010 too, internal discussion take place regard possible set deposit insurance fund. at time, note abandon property banks, constitute dormant account balance 10 years, rise sizeable amount, accord law, fund place bank government safe keeping. accordingly, decide mof cb use fund placed, nucleus deposit insurance fund. thereafter, regular premia pay bank finance companies, base pre-determined formula, could credit new fund, thereby, build fund. in order implement plan, arrangement make government, that, instead credit abandon property fund fiscal coffer government, fund could retain cb purpose initiate deposit insurance fund. in manner, new deposit insurance fund created, result, long felt need fulfilled! in fact, scheme innovatively design provide “pay out” event financial institution collapse render dysfunctional, also provide fund purpose revive and/or restructure viable financial institution face liquidity crisis time time. in context, i please state monetary board recently decide invest part fund deal structural imbalance arise certain finance companies, infusion would encourage new investor take over, revive restructure trouble institutions, great confidence certainty. case study 6: stabilization measure 2012 mr. chairman, next illustration i want present one clear example policy co-ordination fiscal monetary policy. that stabilization package 2012, introduce mof cb february april 2012, response pressure balance payments, high imports, high credit growth pressure exchange rate. a know, deal grow tension, central bank increase policy interest rates, allow exchange rate flexible place 18% credit ceiling upon banks’ lending. in tandem, government impose high duty import vehicle commodities, increase administratively determine price petroleum products. these measure implement carefully plan logical sequence. a consequence, desire stability within economy achieve quickly, balance payment return positive territory, exchange rate stabilizing. in fact, new situation enable monetary board relax monetary policy tighten cycle commence february 2012, early december 2012. this joint exercise therefore show quickly effectively, coordinate fiscal monetary policy could deliver results, instead implementation stand-alone monetary fiscal policies, usually take long time impact economy, thus result entire economy suffer tight policy long period time. case study 7: judicious use fiscal policies, base inflation behavior macro-economic factor mr. chairman, i far discuss 6 case study confirm co-operation harmonization mof cb. the co-ordination however, go even apply several situation well. now, i go describe one general 12 bi central bankers’ speech example several similar instance take place time time, past years. let u take mind back october/november 2011. at time, global oil price soar dizzy heights, ceylon petroleum corporation incur rather heavy losses. a natural response therefore, increase administrate price petroleum product seem like sensible action. however, time, inflation country around 7% level. inflation projection next 2 month too, around 7% 8% levels. in background, view that, petroleum price adjust upwards significantly, inflation figure would rise 10%, happened, favourable sentiment build carefully previous 33 month would badly damaged. then, would start inflation control effort again, inflation expectation would suffer considerably. so, balance strike decision increase petroleum price postpone february 2012, know that, time, inflation figure would low, le 3%, benign situation would give u comfortable cushion make price adjustment, without harm inflation number inflation outlook. this then, one, representative case study hold difficult position short term, realize long term position, benefit even significant outcome. it was, exter may happy acknowledge present, pragmatic decision government work closely central bank, cooperate complex delicate issue, deliver stability growth long term. a “shared vision” “goal congruence” mr. chairman, i often ask people exact definition economic philosophy behind country’s economic policies. a usual field learning, academic scholar like categorize series policies, accord general character, place framework pre-determined school thought. where would current economic policy framework, fit in? be particular model sri lanka follows? to respond questions, let u try understand exactly economic planner doing, attempt achieve. in view understanding, clear goal are, i must say, quite few: maintain low level inflation; consolidate fiscal deficit plan basis; promote smes; ensure food security; encourage import substitution; enhance exports; diversify external sector add new area external sector; record current account surplus 2016; deliver balance regional development; ensure infrastructure development take place part country; improve way business; consolidate debt position; encourage savings; eradicate poverty; reduce unemployment low levels; continuously maintain sufficient level foreign reserves; improve live standard people. what would collection policy design implement deliver outcomes, called? in humility, i must admit, i don’t know. that perhaps could academic scholar propose, debate decide. but time being, let say that, whatever policy may collectively called, determine implement harmonize approach design take u forward, towards vital target simultaneously. i would also argue that, approach successful long term, must always retain one important feature current economic management, mof cb must “shared” vision “shared objectives”. that share vision platform help two institution achieve “goal congruence” recent past, also doubt result harmonization powerful drive force behind steady progress. bi central bankers’ speech 13 in meantime, must also appreciate large segment economic activity carry private sector, many belong. your contribution then, also vital factor maintain momentum thrust economy. therefore, let acknowledge today that, amount harmonization monetary fiscal policy could ever substitute commitment dedication vast number entrepreneur take risks, well burn mid-night oil, deliver value economy. a future role accountancy profession where go here? in view, sri lanka begin excite adventurous journey, steadily move towards us$ 100 billion economy would diversify stable. needle say, success journey would depend great extent harmonize policies, clarity communication, quick implementation, maintenance vibrant momentum continuous basis. in context, i see account profession play increasingly significant role. i see accountant vital partner operationalizing 5 major hubs, particular, commercial knowledge hub keen establish country. the ca expertise accounting, auditing, taxation, information technology, financial management, banking, planning, financial analysis project management, among many skills. the contribution could make new sri lanka unfold us, therefore, immense. the skill posse finance, plan business also varied, hence could play important role many sphere public private enterprise country. i confident would respond call, would enhance role country’s economic activity future. a finance man governor? let strike slightly personal note i proceed conclude address. in order so, let quote exter say person select governor: “although ultimate authority rest monetary board, draft law nevertheless recognize need strong chief executive central bank. accordingly, governor make chairman monetary board, give control agenda meetings. he responsible execution administration policy measure adopt monetary board, direction, supervision control operation central bank, internal management administration. he chief representative bank relation outside persons, ….. accordingly, governor man recognize outstanding competence in, understand of, economic financial problem ceylon, unquestioned integrity responsibility...” exter states, i quote further: “it important governor actual financial experience. in many country point actually incorporate legislation, follow quotation de kock’s book central bank shows: ‘… case central bank lay statute governor deputy-governor shall ‘men prove financial experience’, canada, ‘persons possess actual bank experience’, new zealand, ‘persons recognize bank financial experience’, argentina, governor shall ‘person test bank experience’, union south africa mexico.’” mr. chairman, may remember i first appoint governor, claim person “financial experience”, suitable choice, undertake duty governor. while i firmly believe history judge whether i successful discharge responsibility governor, i also believe even late stage, may useful critic reflect profile 14 bi central bankers’ speech john exter mind position governor draft mla, perhaps consider, whether not, i fit envisage profile! in background, i incline believe education, training, professional skill impart institute charter accountant sri lanka, major role appoint pivotal position governor central bank sri lanka. therefore, please permit officially publicly thank institute charter accountant sri lanka tremendous impact institute academic professional career, addition singular honour bestow evening, invite deliver prestigious oration. conclusion – run wickets! mr. chairman, let conclude, little story. about 6 month ago, journalist friend ask explain official relationship governor secretary, treasury. in response, i give long lecture half hour, like i do today! while listen me, i could see quite restless, somewhat bored. so, i surprise remark sure explain i say him, ordinary people, explanation seem technical high-flown. he tell me, “governor, can please explain say me, layman’s language?” this reply challenge question: “to score run cricket match, one batsman strike ball, batsman run, opposite ends. when second batsman strike ball, again, batsman run, opposite ends. that team able accumulate runs. for effective partnership built, batsman diligently run other’s strikes. in way, economic partnership country succeed, vital clear understand governor secretary, treasury. and, time governor strikes, governor secretary run, secretary strikes, governor secretary run again. that type relationship exist governor secretary treasury.” my journalist friend’s eye brighten boredom vanished. the expression face indicate finally understand complex relationship about. then, say “ah, it’s like run wickets!” bi central bankers’ speech 15 mr. chairman, i sincerely hope address today, help everyone present, also understand complex delicate relationship, manner friend did! thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 glenn stevens: reflection global economy recent economic financial development australia open statement mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, house representative stand committee economics, canberra, 18 december 2013. * * * madam chair member committee thank opportunity meet today. i look forward constructive engagement 44th parliament. a reach close eventful year, perhaps worth reflect key themes, start global economy. at meet previous committee early year, note several developments. fear euro area break-up abated. the unite state economy gradually recovering, slowdown china run course. these outcome roughly expected, though perhaps great significance time fact various “downside risks” materialised. global growth run average, though disastrously so. it think likely pick bite 2013. the period since largely same. the euro area economy contract first part year, may start grow again. it still face immense challenge bank public finances, year uncertainty. but bad fear realised. the unite state continue path gradual recovery, despite budget “sequester” divisive debate debt ceiling. the recovery gradual policymakers would like often nature thing financial crisis. china grow solid pace, line policymakers’ announce intentions, despite concern might slow sharply. global growth probably 3 per cent 2013, little le 2012. the pick-up expect eventuate yet, though forecaster still seem see reasonable prospect occur next year. so past year perhaps label as: quite good hop for, bad feared. look ahead, issue people focus so-called “tapering” u monetary policy. what mean federal reserve expected, point, moderate rate buy security market, presently us$85 billion per month, eventually stop purchases. we don’t know process begin. the feed say depend economic conditions, obviously must. moreover step likely fairly long path back towards “normal” monetary policy. we fairly sure, though, ample potential shift direction reverberate around global markets. that’s usually occur feed change course. the anticipation already factor affect markets, include particular important “emerging market economies”, various point year. it sensible assume case period ahead, “tapering” begin market participant try ascertain extent pace. turn australian economy, february felt growth moderate somewhat would trend while, within range 2–3 per cent 2013. broadly speak occurred. our recent statement monetary policy, release 2 bi central bankers’ speech november, put likely gdp growth within range. the recently release september quarter data don’t cause material change view. this result reflect quite subdue growth private domestic demand, partly offset quite strong growth exports. the large run-up mine investment reach peak, non-mining investment remain low ebb, dwell investment spend early stage upturn. consumer spend rising, average pace, people adjust slow growth income look contain reduce debt. inflation remain consistent 2–3 per cent target. for year december, look though consumer price index rise 2½ per cent, underlie inflation perhaps little that. our assessment inflation remain consistent target next one two years. look ahead, resource sector investment decline – gradually first quickly thereafter. it likely fall considerably next years. there therefore scope form private demand grow quickly, government spend schedule subdued. investment dwell show clear sign significant increase, export resource continue rise strongly. it likely capital spend firm sector outside resource sector eventually pick up, take time yet backdrop challenge environment. consumer demand likely grow rate close income. high wealth confidence could see save rate decline little, consumption driver growth financial crisis. put together, expectation below-trend growth gdp see probably continue bite long yet. over medium term, good grind think growth strengthen. eventually capital spend require sector low present. the corporate sector aggregate high reserve cash, financial intermediary capital market will lend, interest rate low. if nascent improvement “confidence” see sustained, help achieve good growth. in fact, could aspire period growth could bite trend while, since spare capacity economy increase bite past eighteen month so. monetary policy play part support demand. because inflation consistent target, board quite comfortable ease policy significant amount. the cash rate reduce twice since last meet committee, total 225 basis point past two years. borrow rate low level long time. the return saver hold safe asset commensurately declined, clearly prompt substitution towards assets, include equity dwellings. the rate credit growth remain quite low thus far, though increase little, house loan approval move quite noticeably recent months. low interest rate sort thing expect do. this way expansionary monetary policy works. the exchange rate also behaved, late, might expect circumstances: is, declined. from us$1.03 february hearing, fall 13 per cent. the bank describe exchange rate “uncomfortably high”, suggest balance growth economy would probably require low exchange rate. the board maintain open mind whether may need low interest rate further. at point, however, serious claim cost borrow per se hold back growth. on contrary, monetary policy support high spend alter incentive spend saving, work create environment asset credit market eas restraint sort activity. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in end, though, firm individual confidence take advantage situation. they will take risk – new project, new product, new market, new worker. monetary policy can’t force spend occur. that conduct policy also important. the myriad thing make hard easy business innovate, change way things, avoid unnecessary cost productive, matter. no single one decisive itself; collectively, crucial. it hard escape feel society tended, quite long time now, go decision matter make assumption, perhaps without realise it, solid growth economy simply continue, won’t affect choice various kinds. we moment assumption questioned. the path pro-growth, pro-productivity, confidence-building reform would mean basis investment growth real income would improve. that would allow consumption grow without recourse excessive borrowing. it would provide revenue base government provide service infrastructure community needs. and on. the alternative path much le attractive one. before i conclude, word payment regulatory matters. a i mention february hear payment system board work encourage industry put place infrastructure make real-time payment capability community reality next years. good progress made, though long way go. an early milestone reach week ago settlement direct entry payments, amount $50 billion per day, move same-day settlement, oppose previous practice settle next day. quite substantial change operational arrangement private sector, reserve bank itself, require achieve this. but worth low risk system help fast access funds. on financial regulation, global effort build strong framework continues. the financial stability board clear priority come year, head implementation basel iii changes, continue towards completion regime “too big fail” financial institutions, make derivative market safe make sure “shadow banking” activity appropriate oversight. australia, chair g20 year, welcome prioritisation indicate support fsb seek achieve concrete result time leaders’ meet brisbane next november. australian regulatory authority continue, meanwhile, carefully implement internationally agree reforms, due regard local conditions. with remarks, chair, respond questions. bi central bankers’ speech

bankers’ speech 1 guy debelle: remark liquidity address mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, australasian finance bank conference, sydney, 17 december 2013. * * * thank fari organise good conference. today i make point liquidity. i speak number occasions, one year basel iii liquidity regime become fully operational, timely again.1 why liquidity regulation? the fundamental answer bank engage maturity transformation. they borrow short lend long. this service society values. there demand bank provide liquidity services. depositor place save bank want able withdraw part fund short notice. a corporate treasurer want company’s fund account access quickly meet need firm. at time, prefer loan substantially long period time. it would particularly inefficient bothersome renegotiate home loan monthly basis. more importantly, would difficult make sort long-term plan investment decision long-term loan available. this desire liquidity one hand long-term lend intermediate financial sector bank sector particular. but maturity transformation entail expose bank sector liquidity risk. if depositor want money back hurry, bank would able meet obligation without either call loans, may contractually impossible, try sell them. the latter often practically impossible short notice, even possible, may able carry sell asset (such loan portfolios) fire-sale prices. neither outcome socially desirable. fire sale run risk generate contagion financial institution price asset falls, may well hold asset too, and/or may use collateral transaction themselves. fire sale also limit ability institution make sale make good obligations. so externality asset sold, well financial system whole. liquidity regulation address issue ensure bank system level liquidity hand meet predictable liquidity demands. in case basel iii, bank need available sufficient liquidity meet 30-day stress scenario. in simple terms, bank must enough liquid asset easily liquefy (not fire-sale prices) meet liability fall due within 30-day period. in basel iii, asset label high-quality liquid asset (hqla). 1 see debelle g (2013), “the impact payment system prudential reform rba’s provision liquidity”, address australian financial market association reserve bank australia briefing, sydney, 16 august. also see stein j (2013), “liquidity regulation central banking”, speech “finding right

<http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2013/html/sp131003.en.html>. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this imply liquid liabilities, le 30 day maturity, costly bank provide. hence, one would expect see increase cost customer obtain liquidity service. we see start occur australia implementation date basel iii, 1 january 2015, come sight. but sense repricing still come. a i say before, rate return available at-call account seem sufficiently reflect cost bank provide liquidity. maybe wait 31 december 2014 occur, potentially large first-mover disadvantage first reprice product. the low interest rate likely see customer move rapidly competitor yet reprice. in online account world, transaction cost switch low, evidence response rate small interest rate differential rapid. while may repricing come, worth mention part basel iii liquidity standards, bank require demonstrate apra appropriate liquidity transfer price model. apra conduct trial run new liquidity regime come year one might expect new liquidity price model come effect part that. this affect deposit price price side balance sheet, namely loans, well. it particular impact contingent facility line credit. to return issue hqla minute. a aware, shortage hqla australia. the stock government debt issue, commonwealth state, well short liquidity need bank system. hence, part liquidity regime, reserve bank offer bank access commit liquidity facility (clf). for fee, reserve bank make available sufficient liquidity (against eligible collateral) address shortfall hqla beyond bank system’s hold commonwealth state government debt. the motivation reflect societal gain i talk early bank system engage appropriate amount maturity transformation. the price clf aim replicate cost hold hqla form government debt. that is, design liquidity premium embed government paper. the fact cost bank system hold hqla, either form government debt fee pay access clf, keep one main motivation basel iii liquidity regime, namely bank engage appropriate amount maturity transformation. generally speaking, liquidity underprice prior 2007 result excessive maturity transformation undertaken, manifest case highly unstable short-term fund structures. the new liquidity regulation increase cost liquidity, design increase cost much insufficient maturity transformation undertake society’s point view. have talk liquidity bank system’s point view, i finish think liquidity superannuation (pension) system. in many ways, liquidity issue super sector similar bank sector. while super sector generally think asset management business, obviously much intermediation business. it take save invest wide array assets. because portability super account well ability superannuants change asset allocation relatively short notice, super sector also business maturity transformation. some, potentially unknown, share liability may call short notice. but asset long-dated easily liquefy short notice, be, fire-sale prices. a banks, society value maturity transformation super sector undertakes, particularly term fund provide longer-lived projects. but bank system, optimal degree maturity transformation optimal amount liquidity held. it desirable super fund don’t hold asset highly liquid bi central bankers’ speech 3 form fear member may withdraw fund once, bank don’t put asset liquid form fear bank run might occur. but time, desirable super fund’s asset invest highly illiquid assets. to extent, super sector’s relatively large allocation equities, are, principle, easily liquefied, relatively small allocation fix income, easily liquefied, may reflect liquidity considerations. but heart it, liquidity management issue similar face bank. i think many principle liquidity management translate bank sector super sector, although i sense yet fully appreciated. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ben s bernanke: open remark ceremony commemorate centennial federal reserve act open remark mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, ceremony commemorate centennial federal reserve act, washington dc, 16 december 2013. * * * paul alan disadvantage. each u ask reflect term office. but benefit perspective, whereas term still short time run. moreover, work federal reserve’s important challenge past year – notably, achieve full economic recovery crisis put place new financial regulatory system – still ongoing. nonetheless, i offer think past eventful eight years. the federal reserve’s extraordinary response financial crisis great recession follow was, one sense, nothing new. we central bank do many year design do: we serve source liquidity stability financial markets, and, broad economy, work foster economic recovery price stability. however, another sense, new – unprecedented scale scope, make use number tool new, least part standard central bank toolkit. we find new tool necessary fulfill classic function central bank context 21st century economic financial environment. when financial system teeter near collapse 2008 2009, respond 19th century british essayist walter bagehot advised, serve liquidity provider last resort stress financial firm markets.1 but institutional environment different, many way much complex, one bagehot knew. for example, recent crisis involve run financial institutions, occur classic panics. but 2008, rather run retail bank deposits, run occur various form short-term, uninsured wholesale funding, commercial paper repurchase agreements. moreover, although commercial bank suffer large loss come significant pressure, crisis hit particularly hard nonbank institution dependent wholesale funding, investment bank securitization vehicles. thus, feed lend commercial banks, also extend liquidity facility critical nonbank institution key financial markets, commercial paper market. to minimize risk strain abroad feed back u.s. dollar fund markets, feed also coordinate foreign central bank create network currency swap lines. beyond provision liquidity, feed work agency abroad help restore public confidence financial system. notably, lead development stress-testing large bank organizations’ capital adequacy. the first stress tests, 2009, public disclosure result make possible large u.s. bank attract private capital. since 2009, stress test disclosures, together regulatory supervisory actions, contribute double capital hold large u.s. financial institution resumption more-normal flow credit. the feed also work draw appropriate lesson crisis take step necessary help avoid similar event future. a assemble well know, 1 see walter bagehot ([1873] 1897), lombard street: a description money market (new york: charles scribner’s sons). 2 bi central bankers’ speech deliberation lead found federal reserve precipitate financial panic, panic 1907. the preservation financial stability consequently principal goal creator new central bank. in response panic 2008, federal reserve return root restore financial stability central objective alongside traditional goal monetary policy. we refocus supervision financial institution take “macroprudential” approach foster systemic stability well stability individual institutions. we also extensively monitor financial system whole and, cooperation agencies, put place strong oversight systemically important financial firms, include high capital liquidity requirements, tough supervision, process orderly resolution fail firms. we also innovative find way use monetary policy help economy recover deep recession follow crisis. provide adequate monetary accommodation straightforward task principal monetary policy tool, target federal fund rate, stick near zero since end 2008. consequently, we’ve find way bring monetary policy bear, notably include technique design influence longer-term interest rates. for instance, fed, like several central banks, purchase longer-term security put downward pressure longer-term interest rates, help ease financial conditions, promote strong recovery. a significant aspect find innovative way execute duty central bank new, complex environment ongoing revolution communication transparency. part effort involve formally define goal mandate maximum employment price stability give u congress. two year ago, establish 2 percent inflation goal, regularly communicate policymakers’ view level unemployment expect correspond maximum sustainable employment time. additionally, monetary policy come rely heavily “forward guidance.” with short-term policy rate low practicably go, seek ease financial condition provide additional impetus recovery communicate quantitatively likely future path policy rate qualitatively likely evolution balance sheet. other central bank around world meet challenge current condition similar innovations. and i would remiss i point out, especially paul alan here, fed’s recent communication innovation owe great deal development like monetary target framework devise chairman volcker post-federal open market committee statement qualitative forward guidance introduce chairman greenspan. in summary, financial crisis feed confront five year ago many way analogous panic central bank face centuries. but, time, crisis deep recession follow occur economic financial environment certainly different, many way complex, past. the federal reserve find way carry traditional central bank function environment, work policymakers, domestically internationally, put place strengthen regulatory framework help preserve stability face complexity, interconnectedness, innovation modern financial system. one personal objective since i become chairman increase transparency feed – clearly explain policy intend work think behind decisions. a i already noted, improve communication help policy work better, whether disclosure bank stress-test result help public market participant good understand monetary policy likely evolve. ultimately, however, important reason transparency clear communication help ensure accountability independent institution american people elect representatives. clarity, transparency, accountability help build public confidence federal reserve, essential successful foster stability prosperity. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fabio panetta: sepa repercussion italy’s payment system welcome address mr fabio panetta, deputy director

ambassadors, bank finland, helsinki, 12 december 2013. * * * accompany slide find bank finlands’ website: slide (pdf). we experience series different type crisis since 2008. each devastate effect real economy. what learnt? the crisis make clear highly interconnect financial sector require strong institutional framework currently have. a problem one bank quickly spread one home beyond national border damage effect real economy taxpayers. the financial crisis lead sudden stop capital flow within europe, bank withdraw foreign operation financial integration take serious setbacks. by 2010, become desperately evident bank sovereign risk tightly interconnect two-way causality. the key lesson learn financial crisis devastate effect real economy, taxpayer whole society. recovery crisis always painfully slow long-lasting. financial trilemma all all, mismatch scope international bank operation national supervisory framework make situation extremely challenging. with overarch objective financial stability mind, situation describe “financial trilemma”, dirk schoenmaker proposed.1 in principle, envisage three solution financial trilemma. first all, could re-nationalize financial markets. in solution, single market well single currency single monetary policy would lost. second, could accept risk financial instability. or finally, could work create bank union, single supervision resolution. only last one acceptable. institutional arrangement supervision resolution need match integrate structure bank business real world. bank union in june 2012, eu leader agree deepen economic monetary union remedy crisis, include create true bank union. the single rulebook provide foundation bank union. it base idea identical regulatory requirements, capital adequacy rule banks. these achieve european legislation lower-level provisions, bind standard develop european bank authority. the rulebook leaves, however, leeway national authority impose strict requirement national level macro-prudential reasons, contain real-estate bubbles. the great progress achieve field single supervisory mechanism. in november, eu regulation come effect assign supervisory competency 1 dirk schoenmaker (2011) “the financial trilemma”, economics letter 111, 57–59. 2 bi central bankers’ speech european central bank (ecb). when ecb assume supervisory task next year, two clearly separate function – monetary policy bank supervision. another important pillar bank union single resolution mechanism. a know, intensive talk go among member state field. in addition, deposit insurance scheme strengthen harmonise part bank union. in future, bank union, properly implemented, help u avoid use taxpayers’ money bank bail-outs. the bank union may also complement structural reforms, suggest high-level expert group reform eu bank sector.2 the european commission currently finalise stance issue, proposal expect near future. preparation single supervisory mechanism today, i would like focus status preparation single supervisory mechanism (ssm). the eu regulation assign supervisory task ecb become effective early november. already well ahead time, ecb national supervisor start practical preparation ensure timely adoption supervisory responsibility ssm. a concrete step, ecb govern council nominate m danièle nouy, current secretary general acpr, french supervisory authority, chair supervisory board new single supervisory mechanism. her nomination confirm yesterday european parliament. a broad recruitment process supervisory management position also launch ecb. the supervisory board ssm start activity soon possible, likely early next year. before ecb assume supervisory responsibilities, on-going transition period, comprehensive assessment significant bank carry out. during period preparation ssm completed. before assumption ssm supervisory role, result comprehensive assessment possible corrective measure bank – necessary – disclosed. in november 2014, ecb start directly supervise significant bank – close cooperation national supervisors. in addition, bank continue supervise national supervisors, ecb assume direct supervision one credit institution order ensure consistent application high supervisory standards. comprehensive assessment the comprehensive assessment essential element preparation ssm, also stipulate regulation assign supervisory responsibility ecb (also know ssm regulation). it note ssm regulation require ecb carry comprehensive assessment, also enable ecb obtain relevant information national authority necessary make assessment. the comprehensive assessment three main goals. first all, assessment aim transparency enhance quality information available condition banks. it second goal repair banks’ condition identify implement necessary corrective action necessary. finally, comprehensive assessment 2 see high-level expert group reform structure eu bank sector, chair erkki liikanen, final report, brussels, 2 october 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 3 build confidence assure relevant stakeholder bank fundamentally sound trustworthy. the ecb conduct comprehensive assessment close cooperation national authorities. the ecb detail design strategy assessment exercise, monitor execution, perform quality assurance well collect consolidate result finalise disclose overall assessment. national supervisor execute exercise national level, benefit local knowledge, follow common data requirement methodology. the comprehensive assessment truly huge effort, involve around 130 bank groups, large coverage euro area. for finland, assessment cover three main bank groups, op-pohjola group, nordea bank finland oyj, well danske bank oyj. the comprehensive assessment comprise three main pillars: first, risk assessment exercise address key risk banks’ balance sheets, include liquidity, leverage funding. second, asset quality review examine banks’ balance sheet base information end 2013. third, stress test complement asset quality review provide forward-looking view banks’ risk-absorption capacity stress. the structure comprehensive assessment also clarify frequently ask question difference exercise previously conduct eu level stress test clearly identify problems. the key difference separate risk assessment exercise asset quality review conduct stress-test, apply common definitions. three target achieved: • banks’ risk asset quality assess comprehensive manner bank union level. assessment make apply common definitions, allow diverge national interpretations. • sufficient corrective measure guarantee ecb supervisory role necessary supervisory powers. • quality assessment ensure ecb’s strict procedure on-going quality assurance, also involvement third party evaluators. in addition, critical approach take stress-testing banks’ internal model assessment performance. the ecb conclude comprehensive assessment october 2014, assume supervisory role. the result assessment publish single disclosure, include three part exercise. the result comprehensive assessment follow corrective measure necessary. such measure could include, instance, recapitalisation, also profit retention, equity issuance, re-orientation fund sources, asset separation sales. the member state make appropriate arrangement ex ante availability national backstop use case private source capital insufficient corrective measures. other preparatory work ssm alongside comprehensive assessment, lot preparatory work on-going ssm supervision. the ssm supervisory model heart structure ssm activities. for supervisory issues, ecb decision-making structure different monetary policy. follow legal provisions, key decision finally approve ecb govern council. however, regard supervisory matters, new supervisory board predominant role. the board provide govern council draft 4 bi central bankers’ speech decision, govern council approve call non-objection procedure. this procedure also help keep monetary policy bank supervision separate within ecb. at practical level supervisory model, joint supervisory team key actors. such team create significant bank bank group directly supervise ecb. joint supervisory team responsible day-to-day supervision significant banks. each team compose staff ecb national supervisors. the ssm regulation require ecb take direct supervisory role bank deem “significant” provisions. for identification significant institutions, map euro area bank system necessary. this exercise involve survey bank group structure collection data relevant bank groups. for legal dimension ssm, preparation include development call framework regulation cover cooperation within ssm, among things. in respect, public consultation expect take place first half 2014. bank supervision require smooth flow information bank supervisors. to end, high-standard data report framework associate infrastructure ssm developed. banks’ perspective ssm from banks’ perspective, introduction ssm mean numerous changes. i mention them. for cross-border bank, operate multiple country within bank union, single supervision effectively simplify contact authorities. it need work single supervisor operate follow single rulebook. this imply low cost bank comply regulatory requirements. common rule method supervision also broad impact competition among banks. the bank treat equally supervision regulatory capture fully avoided, thereby ensure level play field. in general, i believe ssm become one lead bank supervisor world, apply best possible tool supervision – develop tool also supervisors. high-quality supervision benefit bank act prudently efficient business structures. macroprudential policy finally, i would like point alongside preparation ssm, new systemic angle add supervision. also new eu capital requirement legislation, macroprudential policy become effective eu. macroprudential policy identifying, prevent mitigate systemic risk application macroprudential instruments. a key macroprudential instrument include toolbox authority eu counter-cyclical capital buffer. the relevant authority may require bank hold extra buff capital addition minimum requirements, instance credit growth financial system deem excessive. macroprudential policy responsibility lie first place national authorities, ssm regulation assign macroprudential task also ecb. in particular, ecb may decide strict measure national authorities, use counter-cyclical buff macro-prudential tool provide eu legislation. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a conclusion, i would like end presentation positive note, base fresh news hear ecofin meet hold day yesterday. discussion single resolution mechanism seem progressing, expect good result brussels next week. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: how financial crisis impact central bank cooperation eu economic, financial regulatory development speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, high-level conference “on international central bank cooperation before, crisis”, host european central bank, frankfurt main, 9 december 2013. * * * dear participants, it honor participate important conference i want thank organizer invite me. in speech i focus recent financial crisis change central bank work respect adoption macro-prudential policy relationship monetary policy. then i share think experience see country crisis, highlight challenge face give recent economic, financial regulatory development eu. the crisis go through, profound lasting, leave mark economics general, central bank particular. up great recession, monetary policy live world may call “the inflation target era”. in many way inflation target make central bank’s job relatively simple, long follow policy correctly. the central bank, see public independent institution, credibly commit explicit inflation target, order anchor mid-term inflation expectations. self-fulfilling expectation economic agent price setter would, turn, help deliver objective monetary policy. economist believe stabilize consumer prices, financial asset would also behave stable predictable way. the crisis painfully remind u behavior financial market always rational lack confidence market spiral control, send shockwaves throughout economy. escalate asset price sudden burst affect significantly behavior balance sheet economic agent challenge stability financial system. in respect, concept financial stability see byproduct monetary stability. micro-prudential supervision focus soundness individual financial institutions, belief sufficient ensure aggregate stability financial system. again, recent financial crisis make clear micro-prudential supervision insufficient detect address buildup risk entire financial system due externalities, herd behaviors, common exposure pro-cyclicality financial system activity. moreover, financial institution systemic importance prove “too big fail” measure need deal exist systemic institution global local level. recovery resolution power financial institution strengthened. limit systemic risk, time structural dimension, objective macro-prudential policy. in last 3 years, significant progress identification several instrument designed: • address rapid expansion concentration lend activity; • ensure bank sufficient liquidity cope different shocks; • discourage risky behavior financial institution increase demand capital activities. these measure may countercyclical nature could apply financial institution base systemic importance. these standard require build institutional framework clear identification authority /authorities macro-prudential powers, accordance structure 2 bi central bankers’ speech level market development. central bank appear good position authority perform macro-prudential role. in addition exclusive responsibility formulate implement monetary policy, central bank advantage relate with: • involvement develop payment system infrastructure; • access wide market financial system data; • and, many times, role regulator supervisor banks. nowadays widely accept huge progress worldwide ensure legal operational independence central bank another important reason entrust macro-prudential policy. in order correctly define macro-prudential function central bank, important establish right relationship monetary policy. this do understand policies, design implement properly, complement other. monetary policy still pursue course follow low inflationary pressures, macro-prudential measure use address early risk develop low interest rate environment. on hand, macro-prudential measure also use mitigate risk incoming capital flows, environment relatively high real interest rates. instance conflict among two policy neglect though. these instance pronounce objective two policy wrongly define certain financial situation, respective tool use scope. for reason, i believe might helpful uphold monetary policy primary objective central bank. stabilize inflation something central banker may proud of, something cherish continue strive for. but must recognize financial stability issue relate macro-prudential measure gain significantly grind central bank discussion decisions. clearly, course monetary policy continue extensively discuss future, base improve understand role asset price financial frictions. incorporate financial stability objective inflation target regime consider albania opportunity understand address economic development potential macro-financial risks, order preserve long-run economic stability. while mandate macro-prudential policy tool must clear, one recognize wide effect financial system real economy. for reason, discussion macro-prudential policy measure must involve authorities, include fiscal one. many country establish inter-institutional entity soft hard power design implement macro-prudential policy mitigate systemic risk. the role central bank inter-institutional entity reflect legislation tradition, independence objective. although central bank may always chair entities, central bank play critical role underpin function give information expertise provide. how policy develop south eastern europe (see) region? in spite solid growth run it, global crisis find see vulnerable position. to large extent, growth model base encourage domestic absorption turn partly finance external borrowing. financial inflow channel see economy largely eu bank subsidiaries. in see, encourage investment real estate service sector reflect large current account deficits. external competitiveness structural reform slip gradually policymaker’s agenda, fiscal position allow deteriorate financial safety net weak. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a result, crisis hit see face structural cyclical problem. the overall economic structure competitive growth decline external demand collapse domestic demand suffer high uncertainties, high risk premium lack funding. on financial side, economy suffer foreign bank deleveraged reduce exposure see. on top this, several country face high vulnerability financial system, npl’s grow rapidly combination weak growth fx currency loan un-hedged borrowers. this picture course generalization. different country different experiences, depend initial condition policy responses. however, crisis expose several weakness economic model. at time, extent difference among countries, draw conclusion experience: • country favorable initial condition suffer least. albania one case. we entirely avoid build-up imbalances, careful enough avoid currency mismatch bank lending, foster prudent business model bank system, avoid short-term currency inflow focus overall stability precondition long term growth. • country stability long-term orient policy perform better. the policy dilemma see largely whether support economic growth countercyclical policy prioritize economic financial stability tough corrective action. provide macroeconomic stimulus economy import-oriented may prove futile exercise. a result, albania increase effort restructure economy. the boa also seek increase transparency bank system strengthen balance sheets, capital increase tackle bad loans. the latter do promote credit restructure credit write-offs. in regard focus bank albania include micro-approach analyze bad debtor systemic importance. • international cooperation prerequisite mitigate contagion effect successful crisis management. particularly, vienna initiative instrumental limit deleveraging process private bank system economies. • safety net improved, order make efficient sustainable. several issue remain solved. see economy rightly choose integration eu main goal. it help anchor political systems, structural reforms, legal regulatory environment macroeconomic financial policies. however, economic growth model change. the main focus national authority see facilitate allocation capital productive sectors, provide right incentive structural reforms, legal environment, tax policies, economic stability. in financial system countries, dominate banks, deleveraging process undergo pressure deteriorate loan quality. credit make scarce bank become risk averse hesitate lend potential borrower tighten lend terms. hence, real sector agents, particularly firm operate ail sector economy, face surmount short-term finance difficulty lose sight future objectives. the process restructure firm find way business change become efficient, order survive restart growth. finance knowhow particularly important restructure phase. what role financial system process? we clear two issues: (1) construct financial system pursue financial integration strategy base banks. in fact, comprise 90% financial system throughout region. we think model successful minor revision serve economy 4 bi central bankers’ speech future. for one, foreign bank bring expertise mostly stability financial system. but, recent experience soften argument. (2) bank main vehicle financial inflow. a converge economy see expect run current account deficits. a such, capital hungry region international bank intermediate. a new business model rely purely domestically generate deposit wrong answer previous extreme huge capital inflows. a happy medium sought, one base careful sustainable inflow funds. how single supervisory mechanism go affect work central bank region? i believe ssm mechanism go positive impact central bank (and regulatory authorities) region discharge responsibility regard supervision macro-prudential policies. regulator region talk single “home” supervisor, expect bring attention supervisory concerns. this process could strengthen central bank region improve cooperation able identify common position communication european central bank. this could address good concern single supervisor could distant worry regulator come small country region. be able cooperate single “home” supervisor, instrumental achieve fast progress process regulatory convergence, establish level play field financial institution region. this something closely guide vienna ii initiative. in addition prepare implementation various regulatory standard relate countercyclical macro-prudential tools, particular short term importance issue link recognition treatment npl. in recent past, country region affect deleveraging process start eu financial system. this mostly felt 2012, follow high capital requirement associate eba stress test november 2011 relevant step take national “home” authority comply capital requirements. next line asset quality review ecb. our hope belief time, concern see country regard potential deleveraging, consider carefully specifically, avoid potential deleveraging. let reiterate economy region currently rely heavily bank finance grow need make credit flow economy. to conclude, allow point importance establish sound framework macro-prudential policy, term tool institutional approach, order deal effectively timely prevention systemic risk. they accompany however, measure relate strengthen crisis management framework. if design properly, macro-prudential policy avoid conflict monetary policy, instead complement appropriately. country see benefit synergy relate adoption single supervisory mechanism. these benefit could large manage strengthen regional cooperation. we still concern potential deleveraging follow forthcoming asset quality review process hope ecb authority eurozone eu, could design limit impact maximum. thank much attention! bi central bankers’ speech 1 ajith nivard cabraal: sri lanka’s peace dividend recipe growth stability presentation mr ajith nivard cabraal, governor central bank sri lanka, 25th anniversary convention association professional banker “beyond growth – formula success”, colombo, 8 october 2013. * * * president association professional bankers, mr. aravinda perera. guest honour immediate past governor, reserve bank india, dr. d. subbarao, deputy governor central bank, distinguish delegate 25thanniversary conference association professional bankers, my dear friends. at outset, i wish thank association professional banker invite even share think occasion 25th anniversary conference. i also delight highly accomplish eminent scholar hold esteem office secretary ministry finance india governor reserve bank india, dr. subbarao deliver keynote address, august conference. i sure scholarly inputs, spice rich experience would add immense value deliberation conference, foundation would provide appropriate platform timely conference theme: “beyond growth – a formula success”. know high technical prowess, vast experience wonderful oratorical skill dr. subbarao, i think i need offer comment theme conference, since would ample justice topic. therefore, i shall merely concentrate subject area president apb invite dwell upon, namely “sri lanka’s peace dividend recipe growth stability”. my dear friends, person look around country witness massive rapid infrastructure development take place. they also experience phenomenal change take place, take place economy. the past major drawback country economy, namely, terrorism conflict, over, far enjoy four half year peace tranquility. much happen period, really peace dividend, although sometimes think terms. therefore, order set background address, let quickly reflect achievements. in post-conflict economy, sri lanka record many important milestones. per caput income double reach u dollar 2,900 relatively short period, thereby elevate country “emerging market economy” status; economy grow robust u dollar 59 billion, u dollar 24 billion 2004; inflation control single digit four half years; poverty level reduce around 6 percent 15%; unemployment reduce le 4 percent; the quality infrastructure enhance level comparable many emerge market economies; foreign reserve maintain 6 billion u dollars; the public debt manage prudently reduce debt-to-gdp ratio high 105 percent 2003 78 percent; an 8 percent economic growth achieve successive year 2010 2011; private foreign investment inflow government exceed us$ 7 billion; the fiscal deficit limit 6.4% 2012, high 9.9% 2009; the country’s do business global rank reach 81st level, 102nd 2010, poise jump 10 place year; regional development make tangible progress western province share gdp reduce around 43% 51% 2005; regular foreign investment flow bank stock market; the bank system maintain stable condition even midst difficult global circumstances. needle say, collective effort put together improve sustain positive outlook nation, ensure conducive investment 2 bi central bankers’ speech atmosphere. in regard, stable inflation comparatively low interest rate regime prevail today, serf important support businesses, reduce risk factors. moreover, country’s peaceful environment, complement political stability, able ensure continue safety investments, provide reasonable yield. in context, robust investment framework along line “5+1” hub concept, open new venture promote maritime, aviation, energy, knowledge commercial sectors, tourism emerge thrust industry great promise. my dear friends, bank sector know well many special initiative take past several year various times, order fashion support transformation. for purpose completeness, let u quickly recollect major initiative help u regard. we establish consultative advisory committee private sector monetary policy financial system stability; we open sri lanka treasury bill bond foreign investors; we issue international sovereign bonds; we introduce mandatory corporate governance practice bank nbfis; we develop resolution scheme stabilize systemically important bank nbfis, needed, apply scheme practically; we establish deposit insurance liquidity support scheme; we fashion current “virtuous cycle” – low inflation low interest rate high investment high growth, etc.; we access imf sba terms, complete programme; we intervene application certain fiscal policies, sympathetic inflation behavior macro-economic factors; we implement tough monitor inflation control measures; we introduce far-reaching stabilization measure whenever needed; we relax foreign exchange regulation plan basis. that list “have dones” therefore impressive one. but, would first admit that, past. the challenge would journey future. how reach us$ 100 billion economy? how proceed beyond us$ 4,000 per caput income level? how ensure fall prey deadly “middle-income trap” snare many country past? how ensure transformation sustainable long lasting? how maintain momentum? in short, “recipe” sri lanka must growth stability, next decade beyond? i believe question important ones, economic policy planner reflect upon, share key stakeholder economy. while so, would also many matter issue stakeholder economy would need give continuous attention, share policy makers. it’s two way process! in context, i believe 25th anniversary conference would provide useful opportunity broad discussion important “recipe”, we, policy maker would also benefit rich professional contributions. my dear friends, view, sri lanka’s long term growth stability recipe would need contain several key ingredients. first, maintenance sound macro fundamental continuous movement macro fundamental positive benign direction. what would mean, practical sense, maintain inflation low stable level next decade. that would, turn, mean demand side management would carefully anticipate managed, require intervention supply side also need promote encouraged. at time, fiscal consolidation would need sustained, positive effect effort would enable debt dynamic improve constantly. those effort would also support on-going improvement productivity, result benefit influence exchange rate well. business become productive, competitive efficient, overall expansion economy new fronts, particularly 5 hub tourism, bi central bankers’ speech 3 would need continue focus fashion. by constantly improve enable environment economic structures, well ensure private sector stay vibrant, motivate well financed, economy able consistently grow 7% per annum, certain years, even exceed 8%. by maintain momentum, economy would become resilient diversified, thereby enable u face whatever new risk could emerge unpredictable global environment. second, sri lanka would need attract regular capital outside shore order bridge current savings/investment gap sustain 7% growth momentum. in past, person pre-occupied notion foreign direct investment investment government, channel foreign save could enter country. however, take broad view, believe savings/investment gap could bridge several source addition traditional sources. a result, encourage foreign inflow bank sector, foreign inflow stock corporate bond markets, foreign inflow loan capital eligible businesses. all channel make transparent convenient, thereby make easy overseas investor make investments. these convenient inflows, appropriate safeguard provider capital would enable country enjoy sustain inflow savings, would, turn, support high growth momentum envisage economy. third, need continuously ensure stability financial system. in regard, bank nbfi sectors, well insurance sector would play important roles, next years, keen consolidation take place sectors, order strong institution within sectors. in today’s hostile volatile environment, necessary bank nbfis least minimum critical mass, order competitive, resilient strong. that would necessarily mean small le strong institution would need merge other, become target strategic acquisition order create large strong institution sector. such consolidation would also enable governance structure improve, well reduce today’s rather high “cost per transaction”, result enhance scale operations. therefore, next years, would necessary fashion encourage consolidation outcome, policy would lead outcome would need encouraged. fourth, country sustain poverty reduction strategy well continue strategy design foster balance regional growth. over past four half years, enormous investment make north, result northern province reach reasonable parity viz-a-viz provinces. this amaze achievement, i believe able set stage gradual improvement provinces, could bring province close standard western province, already comfortably surpass us$ 4,000 per caput income. the recent infrastructure development drive rural level, particularly construction upgrade rural road supply electricity every household country, together massive stride make make finance accessible people part country, greatly help fulfill objectives. therefore, stage well set constant upgrade variety service provincial level, effective integration area country, good roads, technology, communication, business service bank services. such improvement would serve reduce provincial disparities, thereby allow country achieve ambitious goal le 3% poverty 2016. at time, result fast track development provinces, could probably reach situation gdp contribution advance western province would constitute around 33%, year 2025. such outcome would indicate sustain revival 8 lag provinces, collectively account le 50% gdp contribution year 2005. accordingly, within 20 years, 2005 2025, western province share 4 bi central bankers’ speech country’s gdp could reduce one-half one-third, i believe would well track balance regional growth, whilst also deprive western province fruit rapid development. such transformation would mean cry lead two bloody revolutions, namely, “kolombata kiri, gamata kekiri” would slogan could comfortably relegate dust-bin history. fifth, would need enhance productivity level country, whilst also manage migration large work force current traditional sector new sector open economy. over next years, large number youth skilled person would need form new back-bone labour force need 5 hub tourism, well growth sector health education. where would new work force come from? obviously, need migrate agricultural sector, others would need shift present activity new area activities. such shift would necessarily demand exist economic activity would robustly improve its’ productivity levels, use good technique methods, include application it. that transformation would also suggest massive education train effort would needed, whilst also require enhancement level productivity work ethnic, particularly agriculture sector. those change would vital, well as, good economy. vital, shift take place towards new thrust areas, transformation economy take place planned. good, economic sectors, particularly agriculture, use low level productivity, would get act together quickly transform new good method resource use less! in scenario, excite opportunity emerge towards realization overall high level productivity, i believe bedrock future sustainable development would productivity improvement across sector economy. sixth, sri lanka must continuously improve global rankings. a well known, country lag behind world scene many fronts, mainly result focus nearly 30 years, keep body soul together face deadly terrorist threats. a result, year ago, global rank quite dismal low. of course, rank somewhat high health education high cricket! but unfortunately many business relate indices, lag far behind many countries, score do business, economic freedom, global competiveness, etc. certainly flattering. however, 2 year ago, start initiative carefully examine criterion use rank country relation various indices, take necessary step improve areas, prove world really mean business! i believe effort continue prove successful next years, sri lanka materially improve global rank many business indices, would stand economy great promise potential. that would also help u well position truly gain recognition global hub. in connection, let relate little story may indicate sri lanka’s grow promise potential. a day ago, high rank official one major multinationals meet me, tell become increasingly frustrate high cost bear top asian capital tokyo, beijing, singapore, hong kong, jakarta, manila kuala lampur, make increasingly expensive business cities. accord official, head office therefore actively search alternate city asia good quality infrastructure, high standard law order, efficient communication, convenient sea air connectivity excellent live conditions, order consider re-location regional offices. in regard, say within next years, sri lanka able display high degree improvement area interest multinationals like them, sri lanka could well strong candidate consideration global giants, locate regional offices. in conversation, strike first conversation would bi central bankers’ speech 5 never even remotely possible, five year ago. what strike second, fact sri lanka today move radar screen global giants, show take seriously. that, dear friends, mind, one best indication sri lanka gradually reap peace dividend 30 year conflict! seventh, sri lanka would need show progress political stability sustain basis, next several years. a know, high norm democracy maintain peaceful condition exist, country, compare many countries. however, strong negative publicity drum certain segment overseas sri lankan diaspora, group able portray sri lanka country political human right deficiencies. unfortunately, massive progress sri lanka make recent year regular elections, terrorism violence free conditions, rapid economic development, large scale investments, large number newspapers, tv radio station publish beam news almost every second without censorship whatsoever, give sufficient credit, internationally, result outside world bombard false claim anti-sri lanka forces. although effort inimical group gradually lose steam face sri lankan political structure continuously strengthened, however vital need sri lanka country, sri lankans individuals, work towards develop external image continuous basis. in context, must constantly remind overseas friend sri lanka country 2,500 year history strong political institution educated, politically savvy population, people different castes, creeds, ethnicity, interact lot good many countries. by so, could effectively challenge deal build various false myth may potential threaten political stability country next years. if able respond successfully, convey reality outside world comprehensive manner, could put rest, many unfair false allegation level country. my dear friends, i endeavour explain far key ingredient would need use recipe growth stability. however, know, ingredient alone won’t provide u tasty, wholesome dish. to turn tasty dish, need use ingredients, right quantity quality, prepare temper ingredient properly, mix appropriately, cook right temperature accord require method. it dish tasty, attractive wholesome. what next challenge? in view, special ingredient i far speak of, well element need develop good economy, namely, basic common sense, good timing, sound policy mix, sensible political considerations, continuous well-being people, would need generously use flavour preparation final dish growth stability. we would also need maintain balance ingredient right “temperature” outcome right. after all, dish, overdo half done, go edible. in way, economic planner judiciously give consideration develop match right mix policy work, sensitive time sequence flow policy implementation, growth stability economy would attainable. mr. chairman, dear friends, past 7 years, i believe able deal many challenge within outside, able deliver stability growth economy. nevertheless, must remember yesterday’s tasty meal necessarily mean tomorrow’s meal also tasty. tomorrow another fresh challenge different considerations, circumstances. if able ass condition cleverly, develop plan properly, (and i believe well position so), sri lanka would truly course deliver growth stability sustain basis people economy. 6 bi central bankers’ speech mr. chairman, permit conclude make simple remark path success prosperity, via careful plan hard work. sri lanka far progress promise, “walked talk”. many goal set past major project set sight upon, realized, take shape eyes, dedicate commit actions. let’s encourage inspire successes. let’s also step future, get ready deliver growth stability consistent basis. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: economic recovery euro area – role monetary policy speech mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, belgian financial forum, university antwerp, antwerp, 13 december 2013. * * * i would like thank federic holm-hadulla contribution preparation speech. lady gentlemen, it great pleasure speak today’s event. i would like use opportunity share assessment stand term economic monetary development euro area. i start economic situation currently face give take future outlook, also basis late eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, – know – play important role inform economic analysis quarterly basis. we move trajectory modest growth, gradually recover economic downturn past years. still headwind persist i elaborate minute important headwind currently seeing. i also discus signal come monetary analysis, ass money credit development identify risk price stability medium- long-term horizon. here, particularly credit side present still sluggish, thus point subdue price development medium term future. finally, i draw together complementary bite piece analysis explain current monetary policy orientation, characterise two features: first, expect key interest rate remain present low level extend period time; and, second, stand ready adopt additional accommodative monetary policy measures, necessary safeguard price stability. our late economic analysis let start briefly summarise see euro area economy evolving, include assessment late eurosystem staff projections. the recovery continue proceed modest uneven pace across euro area. in fact, real gdp project pick fourth quarter year onwards, recovery expect accelerate slightly end next year. in euro area whole, real gdp project still contract year 0.4%, increase 1.1% 2014 1.5% 2015. accord staff’s projections, sustain increase activity would mainly drive gradual recovery domestic external demand, pickup domestic demand support several factors: first, reduce uncertainty expect gradually fee real economy. second, accommodative monetary policy stance continue support recovery, provide for: low monetary policy interest rates; extensive fund reassurance euro area banks, inter alia, offer liquidity via fix rate full allotment mode least mid-2015; last positive impact forward guidance money market conditions. third, euro area economy encounter le fiscal drag country make important progress improve budgetary positions. 2 bi central bankers’ speech fourth, real disposable income expect benefit drop commodity prices. and, finally, start 2014, recovery also expect benefit fade credit supply constraints. still, key question ask move fast crisis? the recovery continue face headwinds, especially stress country number factor may hind fast recovery. first, notwithstanding progress rebalancing, many euro area country still see adjustment private public sector balance sheets. don’t forget context past recovery drive pick-up house construction activity continue fee way overall economy. now, lot household wealth lose crisis balance sheet private public sector still retrenching, traditional source recovery seem hamper le desirable, call structural balance growth models. second, closely related, investment decline past year likely gradually pick-up, start level far pre-crisis averages. of course, anaemic demand conditions, corporate balance sheet restructure high lend rate particularly smes several country weigh investment. and third, labour market condition provide much comfort. unemployment expect remain high persistent. consider also somewhat le favourable outlook labour intensive sector grow structural component current unemployment figure may see sluggish labour market condition time future, despite decrease labour cost conditions. overall, significant amount slack economy persist end projection horizon. moreover, balance risk around project real gdp growth outlook downside 2014 2015. this reflect mainly three risk factors, comprising: potentially high oil prices, low euro area foreign demand additional fiscal consolidation efforts, particular 2015. so imply price developments? in keep weak economic dynamics, continue expect subdue inflation extend medium-term. accord staff projections, euro area hicp inflation project edge slightly upwards 0.9% fourth quarter 2013 1.2–1.3% rest projection horizon. in yearly averages, hicp inflation project reach 1.4% 2013, 1.1% 2014 1.3% 2015. when interpret subdue inflation profile, also important consider main drivers. for example, merely observe one-off decline volatile component hicp inflation, le policy concern low inflation reflect interplay durable economic factors, thus show also le volatile components. however, decompose euro area inflation last two year le volatile component yield clear-cut picture regard. on one hand, see energy food price (both tend relatively volatile) play major role – account 80% 2.1 percentage point decline hicp inflation period. on hand, also observe decline contribution non-energy industrial good notably service price – closely relate fundamental factors. bi central bankers’ speech 3 also, low inflation outcome policy measures. a case point germany, inflation remain relatively low, despite robust recovery crisis. but wage development moderate germany, compensation per employee grow 1.8% year year reflection structural reform undertake past. and, germany compare euro area country record relatively low contribution high indirect tax administrative price inflation. at euro area level, staff see risk project hicp inflation outlook slightly upside towards end projection horizon. this upside risk high oil prices, depreciation euro high indirect tax partly offset downside risk stem low foreign domestic demand. overall, staff projection line assessment subdue underlie price cost pressure suggest period prolong low inflation. indeed, pipeline price pressure pressure appear low producer price decline while, recently decline even –1.4% october –0.9% september. also labour cost pressure much contained, particularly presence moderate wage growth, high unemployment ample spare capacity. external price pressure ease first three quarter 2013, i.a. owe sluggish global demand decline oil non-oil commodity prices. the import deflator thus estimate decline year-on-year term period. while continue fall follow quarter result factors, import deflator expect increase slightly mid-2014 onwards, downward impact previous appreciation euro fade away, non-energy commodity price increase import demand gain momentum, allow strong mark-ups. on basis, also recent assessment december govern council meet fully consistent say time: inflation low expect change time. signal monetary pillar let turn signal receive monetary pillar. in nutshell, signal confirm subdue medium-term inflation outlook derive economic analysis. while monetary dynamic weak, essentially since onset crisis, growth broad money moderate recent months. the annual growth rate broad monetary aggregate m3 decrease 1.4% october 2013 (or 1.7 % adjust one-off effects), late available data point, 2.0% september 2013. this mark continuation deceleration previous months. after m3 still grow 2.8% second quarter 2013, third quarter record significant drop growth rate 2.2%. a key driver recent development m3 that, current environment, monetary asset yield little remuneration. a consequence, money holder incentivised engage two type substitution: either hold liquid instruments, overnight deposits. this show still robust growth narrow monetary aggregate m1, stand 6.6% october 2013, slightly 6.7% september. or diversify away short-term deposit marketable instrument towards good remunerate – risky le liquid – instruments. to extent instrument outside m3, dampen growth broad monetary aggregate. 4 bi central bankers’ speech on positive note, observe strong net inflow capital outside euro area support monetary dynamics. since inflow direct both, stress non-stressed euro area countries, help mitigate financial fragmentation. at time, remain important reinvigorate source money creation also inside euro area recovery take hold. in context, acknowledge provision credit real economy continue contract, even pace contraction level recently. the annual growth rate loan household stand 0.3% october, broadly unchanged since turn year.1 at time, annual rate change loan non-financial corporation –2.9% october, compare –2.8% september. but large firm source finance available. these weak loan dynamic non-financial corporation continue reflect primarily lag relationship business cycle, overall heighten credit risk ongoing deleveraging overall adjustment financial non-financial sector balance sheets, also relate past excesses. the ecb’s comprehensive balance sheet assessment, include asset quality review stress test, lead great clarity state bank sector. combine appropriate resolution strategy backstops, strengthen banks’ balance sheet ultimately improve prospect bank lend future. implication monetary policy how monetary policy act conditions? assess price stability objective, subdue inflation outlook, back weak economic monetary dynamics, clearly warrant accommodative stance. it background low rate november. and background expect key interest rate remain present low level extend period time. take stock effect recent policy measure economic financial conditions, see positive sign emerging. the november rate cut follow pronounce persistent ease monetary condition euro area – manifest instance downward shift term money market interest rate important market interest rates. moreover, forward guidance continue effectively support policy intentions: first, mitigate sensitivity money market term structure surprise economic data releases; second reduce market uncertainty path future short term rates. but notwithstanding favourable track record recent policy measures, remain alert contingency may give rise downside risk price stability. in particular, closely monitor money market condition potential impact monetary policy stance. by extend horizon fix rate full allotment mode least mid-2015 provide additional fund reassurance support transmission monetary policy signal bank system. 1 the number loan household non-financial corporation adjust loan sale securitisation. bi central bankers’ speech 5 at time, stand ready adopt additional measure observe development money market condition threaten interfere policy intentions. moreover, subdue inflation outlook provide little safety margin adverse shock may give rise downside risk price stability. that safety margin reflect focal point inflation rate 2% context price stability. it ensure steady state inflation provide sufficient buff away zero. with inflation outlook focal point, reaction time additional accommodative policy action shorten accordingly. in regard, debate among observer focus question, measure ecb take circumstances. a explain – demonstrate – past, ecb position adopt wide range instrument ensure price stability, line extensive instrument independence grant treaties. this allow u tailor policy response specific contingency euro area may face give point time. we continuously evaluate policy option act circumstance warrant adopt measure effective confront challenge hand. but need also wary limitation measures. let’s forget monetary policy stance already accommodative finance condition favourable overall. indeed, see sluggish demand credit despite low lend rates. we see mute investment, despite firm build cash reserves. this cannot solve accommodation, clear cut case right structural policies. in fact, structural economic policy direct towards competitiveness, sustainable fiscal budget financial sector policy governance set stage sound banks’ balance sheet stable financial market conditions, economic confidence confidence euro area economic financial centre return unleash willingness credit provision, investment domestic demand. conclusion with this, let conclude. the euro area economy continue recover, albeit slow uneven pace. reflect weak economic monetary dynamics, underlie price pressure euro area expect remain subdue medium term. the ecb’s monetary policy successfully contribute outlook. our stance accommodative full consistency prime task maintain price stability euro area. this vindicate consistent anchor inflation expectation euro area medium long term line aim maintain inflation rate below, close to, 2%. yet, doubt outlook inflation remain subdue expect gradual upward movement towards inflation rate below, close to, 2% late on. that’s monetary policy continue provide appropriate degree accommodation. and remind forward guidance keep interest rate present low level extend period time remain place. let also assure ecb always respond downside risk price stability emerge go forward. here policy rate margin still leaf room manoeuvre operational framework provide necessary tool react swiftly warranted. 6 bi central bankers’ speech but let’s clear: ensure price stability, ecb make contribution economic recovery. yet, durable return robust sustainable growth require government persevere fiscal structural reform agenda. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jörg asmussen: introductory remark press conference completion eu-funded cooperation programme national bank serbia introductory remark mr jörg asmussen, member executive board european central bank, press conference completion eu-funded cooperation programme national bank serbia, belgrade, 12 december 2013. * * * governor tabaković, ambassador davenport, ambassadors, lady gentlemen, representative media, dear colleagues, last week, governor tabaković frankfurt ecb’s high-level conference discuss governor senior central banker world role technical cooperation central bank cooperation broadly raise staff institutional capacities. the consensus impact high cooperation open honest, strong commitment dedication sides. a highly successful programme today pleasure belgrade occasion close ecb-coordinated technical cooperation programme national bank serbia. the programme receive fund european commission instrument pre-accession assistance. the aim work support national bank serbia effort bring rules, procedure process close eu central bank standard support bank prepare new legislation implement legal framework european union. this programme characterise positive thing agree last week frankfurt would important success. the programme close today ecb’s complex ambitious programme date. it cover 13 different central bank area implement partnership 21 national central bank european system central banks. more 170 expert eu central bank provide input guidance serbian colleague around 150 serbian colleague visit eu counterpart get hands-on exposure system procedure use respective central banks. together, expert develop impressive number handbooks, guideline procedures, model economic analysis, statistical system new primary secondary legislative acts; whole framework help national bank serbia take important step forward towards implement eu central bank standards. look back, project get underway 1 february 2011, commit work together 24 months. a approach end, saw reach target objective effective efficient way. we therefore agree extend contract 11 month deepen work three areas. this work fully complete ready close programme. in area cover time, national bank serbia continue implement work start together. you can, instance, look forward new update statistic balance payment financial accounts, national bank serbia plan start publish next years. it also new 2 bi central bankers’ speech analytical tool macroeconomic financial stability analysis, allow speak strong voice national international debate. these couple example programme achieved. obviously work end here. there still area within national bank serbia need upgrade join european system central banks. in addition, eu continue update rules, regulation best practices, mean target always moving. let turn point directly link programme, important relate current challenge eu well serbia. common challenge euro area serbia while central bank do limit devastate effect global financial crisis, limit central bank do. the ecb keep interest rate low resort non-standard measure warrant exceptional circumstances, line mandate price stability. maintain price stability best contribution central bank make support economic growth employment. we cannot, however, address underlie root cause problem relate fiscal macroeconomic imbalances, lack competitiveness, low growth high unemployment. government eu member state part work structural reform fiscal consolidation return economy long-term sustainable growth boost employment. while challenge obviously identical, issue also relevant serbia. structural reform enhance competitiveness support growth potential, fiscal consolidation ultimately sustainable convergence challenge address political authority country endeavour move close eu. the best contribution national bank serbia make support achieve price stability, base sound institutional framework ensure independence. turn back euro area, crisis also reveal institutional framework economic monetary union – ecb central bank task ensure price stability – need strengthened. the head state government therefore embark reform euro area governance, including, instance, fiscal framework govern member states’ fiscal policy view enhance fiscal discipline. they also embark creation bank union centralise critical function relate bank sector european level, thereby sever direct link sovereign bank sector prove achilles heel crisis. follow necessary political decisions, ecb start build bank supervisory function responsible direct supervision around 130 systemically relevant bank euro area, well indirect supervision bank consider systemically relevant. the ecb assume role november next year implement new harmonise model together national competent authorities, whether central bank non-central bank supervisors. we call single supervisory mechanism (ssm). this also implication eu candidate country potential candidate western balkans, include serbia, give role bank headquarter euro area bank sector region. the establishment ssm imply many foreign-owned bank operate serbia, ecb become “home” supervisor long supervise different national supervisor depend headquarters. in addition enhance quality supervision parent banks, ssm potential facilitate home-host country cooperation bank supervision – thereby strengthen relationship ecb national bank serbia area well. in parallel, work underway bank bi central bankers’ speech 3 recovery resolution regime, view crucial component sever link sovereign bank complement ssm. an immediate priority euro area repair balance sheet commercial banks, necessary. the ecb conduct comprehensive analysis bank balance sheet assume supervisory responsibility make clear many occasion need european recovery resolution regime place time ssm assume responsibilities. turn serbia again, recent development show similar challenge apply serbian financial sector, level non-performing loan high national bank serbia together relevant national authority improve recovery resolution framework. in words, common challenge need address come years. and ecb’s side, i assure want remain close contact national bank serbia, continue open honest communication – also view open accession negotiation serbia. conclusion let finish acknowledgement express thank play important role make project success: • first, national central bank provide large number expert help u implement programmes; • technical cooperation coordinator national central bank support steer committee monitor guidance programme implementation; • european commission’s eu delegation provide fund allow u recover costs; • national bank serbia governor tabaković, who, open cooperative spirit ownership programme outcomes, real pleasure work with; • last least, two team within ecb national bank serbia, coordinate programme ongoing basis. i congratulate impressive result achieved. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stephen s poloz: monetary policy risk management remark mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, canadian club montreal, montreal, quebec, 12 december 2013. * * * introduction thank kind words. it real pleasure montréal. i go talk today manage risks. this something aspect life – whether run business, pursue career, look family. a make plan pursuit goal, take account could go wrong – do mitigate that. of course, never fully eliminate risk – manage prudently. a economist central banker, i think lot risk. i’m one. in response experience last years, central banker around world adapt way business. at bank canada, recognition increase uncertainty surround us, adjust lens risks, evaluate enter decision monetary policy. that topic afternoon. monetary policy formulation not everything changed, far it. the best way bank canada deliver mandate is, always, keep inflation low, stable predictable. in 1991, bank adopt inflation target and, since 1995, target 2 per cent inflation. the target sacrosanct. and, two decade inflation targeting, generally succeeded: average, inflation close target. this happen itself. like navigate ship, adjust current around u bout foul weather. some challenge minor, call temporary adjustment course speed. others may involve major detour. in worst-case scenarios, risk run aground, even capsizing. in cases, anticipate well react. the bank’s govern council set policy interest rate goal achieve 2 per cent inflation target. central decision view likely path canadian global economies. conditional forecasts, unique path interest rate bring u back target, like captain plot intend course ship. at point process, monetary policy seem like precision engineering. but like sea, monetary policy, view always perfectly clear. give we’ve continue experience, forecast pinpoint numbers; rather, represent range likely outcomes. likewise, economic model good source question answers. to make sure uncertainty acknowledge actually embed policy decisions, incorporate explicit “rule-of-thumb” range around critical variable projection. in so, remind – watch u – that, especially wake crisis, economic projection subject considerable uncertainty. 2 bi central bankers’ speech indeed, canada come global financial crisis ensue great recession good g-7 peers, take long expect – desire – get home. our economy still return full capacity, inflation run persistently 2 per cent target. because unprecedented nature crisis subsequent recession, global recovery anything smooth normal. a navigate uncharted waters, especially vigilant lookout risk could push u course. assess risk two lens this lookout important element policy deliberations. we ass risk could interact other. we gauge potential impact. and use judgment determine balance among them, today prospect. in fact, monetary policy formulation day process risk management one precision engineering. it important stress risk part baseline forecast – bank expect see, rather, possible deviation anticipate. we work avoid or, least, mitigate them. the bank canada look risk two lenses: (i) possible impact outlook real economic activity inflation, (ii) possible impact stability financial system. these two set risk relate but, moment, let discus separately. target inflation necessarily forward-looking activity. it inform work economic forecaster crunch data use model ass likely future path inflation. a inflation target symmetric, care upside downside risk inflation. of course, already target, today, care downside risk upside ones. the bank’s projection inflation assessment risk around projection publish quarterly monetary policy report (mpr). risk financial stability view separate lens. the risk consider potential disrupt harm financial system – namely, downside, bad, risks. our primary objective determine likelihood materialize and, occur, impact financial institution function markets. the bank examine risk depth twice year financial system review (fsr), recent publish two day ago. while examine two set risk different perspectives, take consideration interplay them. we learned, painful experience recent crisis, pursue economic stability without due regard financial stability risk achieve neither. both necessary, neither sufficient. both central complement other, substitutes. it follow naturally that, policy-makers, consider risk economic stability financial stability integrate fashion. like two lens binoculars, add depth understand force play. avoid disaster let use couple examples. people ask every day potential, present situation, runaway inflation runaway deflation. indeed, sometimes person worry both! these risk sit extreme distribution what’s possible. i’ll address turn. bi central bankers’ speech 3 runaway inflation let’s talk first risk runaway inflation. this happen 40 year ago canada advance economies. price spiral up, economic growth weak unemployment rising. inflation get away us. people’s expectation future inflation become unanchored, push actual inflation. interest rate also high, save erode high inflation. when bank canada finally make determine effort bring inflation back control, economy go major recession. some wonder today’s easy monetary policy canada – alongside quantitative ease country – could lead similar outcome. their fear money creation eventually go result explosion inflation. they needn’t worry. the situation different early 1970s. monetary stimulus today offset serious still ongoing downside shock result crisis. of course, worth ask happen negative force abate. could additional liquidity fuel inflation then? my answer is: central bank need drain extra liquidity system point, economy heals. while i don’t want underestimate challenge get exit exactly right, i confident ability keep inflation take off. in short, remain vigilant. we prepare remove monetary stimulus it’s long need offset force currently pull inflation target. but, right now, look u like take around two year get inflation back 2 per cent. deflation let’s switch gear look risk outright deflation. like out-of-control inflation, deflation become spiral, downward one. expectation become unanchored downside, people put purchase expect thing le expensive later. demand decline prices, weight debt economy grows. in great depression, consumer price canada fell 25 per cent, national output drop almost third. the human cost staggering, unemployment reach 20 per cent. a mild form deflationary trap nag japan past 20 years. what i describe economy-wide process deflation, quite different individual price fall improve competitiveness economy still grow strongly. today, concern even though policy-makers successful avoid global deflation wake 2008 crisis, still risk inflation could creep deflationary territory aftershock crisis persist. it is, least part, counter risk central bank number country keep interest rate low use unconventional monetary policies, quantitative easing, provide additional stimulus economies. history teach u deflation usually come wake financial crisis. this true great depression, japanese deflation 1990s. perhaps important lesson crisis, then, stable financial system necessary keep inflation low, stable predictable – limit risk fall deflationary trap. the policy response – where financial stability come in? this g-20 leader launch reform agenda 2009 make global financial system robust. in short, never want go again. since crisis, central bank also focus great attention financial stability issues. in fact, 4 bi central bankers’ speech return roots. many central bank create primarily preserve financial stability. this include bank canada, come great depression. the first line defence buildup financial imbalance effective regulation supervision. in canada, ultimately minister finance responsible stewardship financial system. regulation carry office superintendent financial institutions, deposit insurance canada deposit insurance corporation, consumer awareness financial consumer agency canada. the bank canada’s assessment financial stability risk important contribution team effort. it also critical, i mention earlier, bank’s policy-making. today, focus particular risk associate household imbalances. to explain, let back bit. at height crisis, although financial system remain sound, export collapsed, cause recession. to support economic growth, rely mainly household spending, support exceptionally stimulative monetary policy. but trade-offs, lot them. today, obvious prolong low interest rate result development imbalance household sector. in canada, see rise level household indebtedness, stretch house-price valuation overinvestment housing. to address imbalances, finance minister tighten mortgage insurance rule four times, among measures, superintendent financial institution introduce strong mortgage underwrite standard canada’s bank institutions. in wake measures, constructive evolution household imbalance begin around middle last year. growth household borrow moderated, residential investment sustainable track. those indicator pick again, think mainly people pull forward plan mortgage rate start move summer. we expect imbalance stabilize gradually unwind come years. in base-case scenario, bank expect soft land house pickup export investment. this rotation relieve tension low demand household imbalances. nonetheless, risk around base case need managed. there risk household imbalance could keep build set stage sharp correction road. such correction would risk canadian economy financial system. our current monetary policy weigh risk risk inflation fall even target. this zone balance relevant today prospect, expect risk diminish next two year so. this i mean i describe monetary policy exercise risk management. credibility count our flexible inflation-targeting framework give u room manoeuvre face unusual shocks. this work expectation well anchored: public confident get 2 per cent target. our commitment inflation target must remain credible. credibility coin. it earn year sound policy. without it, low stable inflation could achieve considerable short-run cost economy – experience early 1980s, tackle runaway inflation. bi central bankers’ speech 5 credibility must employ wisely. we think investment. by use credibility exercise framework’s flexibility, work maintain stable financial condition support expansion capacity return economy full potential. a process unfolds, anticipate future payoff enhance credibility. a decide policy, cannot take credibility granted; must keep earn ensuring, first foremost, monetary policy remain focus keep inflation target. conclusion let conclude. i’ve describe manage menu risk policy decisions: we look risk two lenses. we concern big risk runaway inflation deflation act keep remote. we learned, hard way, financial stability necessary condition low stable inflation, work canada around world improve resilience financial system. our current monetary policy balance risk inflation could drift even target risk exacerbate financial system imbalances. a central bankers, canada globally, new territory. it bring mind sailor another era drive far course nasty storm. when thing calmed, find southern hemisphere. suddenly navigational chart rely – night sky – completely different. we every reason believe that, experience crisis behind us, central bank define differently five year ago. we know economic financial stability intrinsically linked, figure go good integrate two analysis research, policy. on technical level, actively build new model add new detail exist ones. we spend time talk real people make real economic decisions, understand good force facing. and, communicate differently, more, transparency, due regard uncertainty around us. i confident we’ve get roughly right, give know especially don’t. just like sailor open seas, adapt thrive – find way home. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: hear plenary european parliament occasion adoption resolution ecb annual report 2012 introductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, hear plenary european parliament occasion adoption resolution ecb annual report 2012, strasbourg, 12 december 2013. * * * president, honourable member european parliament, i please take part debate ecb annual report 2012. today last time legislature i participate plenary. this represent good opportunity take stock progress make past year strengthen resilience stability euro area. to introduce debate, i would first like review recent ecb’s monetary policy decisions. i address institutional matter particular interest house well progress make far reinforce emu governance. i thereby address issue econ committee highlight draft resolution ecb annual report. ecb’s monetary policy let begin describe economic environment past years. the economic recovery follow post-lehman global recession 2008–09 abort euro area sovereign debt crisis take hold. financial stability threatened; viability bank survive first phase crisis call question. credit curtail recession ensue last first quarter year. since then, experience weak recovery. weak economic activity high unemployment result subdue inflation. against backdrop, respect price stability mandate assign u treaty, low key interest rate historically low levels. to clarify orientation monetary policy go forward exceptionally uncertain environment, introduce forward guidance july 2013: state expect key interest rate remain present low level extend period time. that statement conditional base overall subdue outlook inflation extend medium term, give broad-based weakness real economy subdue monetary dynamics. in november act upon conditional pledge reduce two key interest rates, price pressure diminish anticipate inflation weakness protracted. in keep anticipations, also re-confirmed forward guidance original formulation. over past two year interest rate cut transmit unevenly across euro area countries, due fragmentation financial market along national borders. to address problem, adopt series non-standard measures. the purpose – remain – effective transmission ecb’s interest rate cuts, monetary policy reach euro area company households. our measure address distortion sovereign debt market due redenomination risk alleviate fund pressure euro area banks. at november meet also decide extend time horizon application fix rate full allotment procedure liquidity operation least july 2015. this decision provide counterparties reassurance liquidity necessary re-finance core activity forthcoming main refinance rate. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a direct consequence, bank lend rate household non-financial corporation decrease euro area level. in way, measure help smes, too, backbone euro area economy. we have, addition, take direct measure alleviate fund situation smes collateral framework. and work european commission improve sme finance conditions. institutional matter let turn institutional development focus particular measure relate accountability transparency. since creation always go beyond treaty requirement make work transparent accessible. the monthly press conferences, without precedent time among major central banks, tell example. this year also show ecb stand ready adapt communication policy deem necessary. for example, publish procedure govern provision emergency liquidity assistance (ela). we start internal reflection increase transparency deliberation govern council without undermine independent decision-making members. our commitment accountability transparency also become apparent agreement conclude two institution single supervision mechanism (ssm). supervision necessitate differentiate form accountability monetary policy, preserve independence ecb whole. the inter institutional agreement (iia) strike right balance ensure high standard accountability, transparency safeguard confidential information. i confident implementation iia open new chapter successful cooperation two institutions. in context let also welcome positive vote m nouy’s nomination. follow final appointment council, become main interlocutor matter relate ssm january 1st. i would like also address issue which, i know, much concern me: gender balance ecb. today, 17% management position fill female staff. it clearly enough. this executive board decide summer introduce gender target aim 35 % woman management position 2019. and empty promise. the ecb start implement diversity action plan help u attain targets. let share think process complete emu. take stock progress make towards genuine emu a legislature come end term, opportune time reflect achieve short space time. not long ago euro area face uncertain future. in meantime, doubt integrity single currency dissipated. notably, roadmap genuine emu outline encompass four pillars: bank union, fiscal union, economic union ultimately political union. through concert legislative effort euro area, eu whole, put stable footing. your institution make decisive contribution effort. the establishment single supervisory mechanism (ssm) represent probably significant change eu since establishment single currency i happy report internal preparation well underway. i strongly welcome political agreement bank recovery resolution directive reach council yesterday night. swift agreement key component bank union – single resolution mechanism – paramount importance. i trust succeed adopt relevant legislation term come end. these institution essential implement “single rulebook” year come. look ahead strong set rule bi central bankers’ speech 3 capital liquidity. we also new toolbox resolution financial institutions. and strong national deposit guarantee schemes. bank union however panacea eliminate financial market fragmentation fully stabilise emu. it necessary, sufficient condition break bank-sovereign nexus restore sustainable economic growth. equal borrow condition ensure joint implementation measures. this include continue fiscal consolidation implementation structural reforms, also progress “unions”. only say create genuine emu. let u seize opportunity next ep election open public debate step need strengthen architecture emu. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: interview financial time interview mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, financial times, conduct m claire jones publish 12 december 2013. * * * the european central bank forecast inflation 1.3 per cent 2015, usually see policy-relevant horizon. how justify inflation forecast almost third target two year now? we aim inflation rate close 2% medium term. give subdue outlook prices, already lot. we cut rates. since july 2012 overnight rate general low control major central bank. we offer forward guidance. we extend conduct main refinance operation fix rate tender procedure full allotment least 7 july 2015. so, prolong period low inflation, would expect inflation rate return back rate close 2%. however, take time give nature shock, namely unwind real financial imbalances, possibly long normal transmission lag monetary policy environment. but also say ready act risk downside materialise. what matters, particular, medium long term inflation expectation remain firmly anchor line price stability. mr draghi say last thursday brief discussion negative interest rate ltro would involve extension lend real economy. be two policy feel though could build strong consensus support govern council economic – financial – condition disappoint? what important remember govern council unanimously – i’d like emphasise – share assessment economic conditions. there unanimity outlook; view economy much share govern council. price pressure go subdue prolong period time a result, agree accommodative monetary policy long needed. and even take measures, needed. that’s say: ready act able act. under condition would act? we well aware price pressure likely remain subdue prolong period time expect inflation rate converge towards 2 per cent cyclical upswing economy take hold. we time conscious that, downside risk materialise, – price pressure already weak today – would act decisively again. this view strongly share govern council members. what scenario could lead act? there number downside risk identified. they relate state economy downside risk growth, tighten global financial condition undue spill-overs euro area, energy prices, – last least – fatigue structural reform europe. this would mean investment pick business confidence doesn’t improve further. for that’s 2 bi central bankers’ speech important aspect – structural reform implement improve growth potential, employment opportunity overall confidence. however, last downside risk, monetary policy clearly limit do. another risk would that, result comprehensive assessment, could dampen effect short term. that risk still fairly limit temporary – compensate expansionary effect medium term, positively affect confidence near term. we monitor risk monetary perspective. however, potential procyclical effect aqr lead soften rule aqr. the instrument use handle scenario may depend nature shock. each instrument different impact measure take would depend analysis monetary economic developments. could say little bite possible impact aqr? a strong comprehensive assessment make central bank action effective. monetary policy work well banks’ capital basis thin insufficient support lending. in us, intervene directly market transmit monetary policy stimulus, market play big role finance economy. here, pass-through monetary policy primarily via bank take time. the comprehensive assessment shorten time take monetary policy impact real economy. indeed, easy central bank support economy healthy bank tend lend more. the bad case, say bluntly, central bank provide liquidity bank buy carry legacy assets, bank sector doesn’t restructure. this typically japanese situation early 2000s. perhaps paradoxically, rigorous aqr stress test help monetary policy. appropriately treat banks’ hold sovereign debt accord risk pose banks’ capital make unlikely bank use central bank liquidity excessively increase exposure sovereign debt. this bank wary constraint place sovereign debt stress test subject time. therefore, procyclical impact aqr significant, monetary policy would able act – without hesitation reassure side effect liquidity injection see 2011–2012 operation would minimised. so would ass whether aqr procyclical? don’t forget two pillar approach: analyse business cycle, also look money credit. we see second pillar quickly credit situation doesn’t improve. at stage recovery, see moment quite normal. the big corporate firm many constraint smes. they around €2trn excess cash, access debt markets. the reluctance invest come business confidence side. and act impact aqr, exactly would do? depend situation, central bank decide effective way liquidity provision provided. there restriction way central bank provide liquidity bank via repo, priori. bi central bankers’ speech 3 you want reach price stability objective. at time, want sure provide liquidity adequate collateral, doesn’t reduce incentive restructure bank sector. and well-designed comprehensive assessment – like one we’re prepare – ease job central bank. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: resilience swiss bank financial stability perspective introductory remark mr jean-pierre danthine, vice chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 12 december 2013. * * * in remarks, i would like look situation swiss bank financial stability perspective, take big bank first move discussion domestically focus banks. to close, i say word subject banknotes. big banks: strengthen resilience since last medium news conference june, two swiss big bank improve capital situation further. this apply particularly risk-weighted capital ratios, where, international comparison, average large global banks. credit suisse, example, already meet requirement 13% loss-absorbing capital risk-weighted assets, come force 2019. accord publish plans, ubs able meet target end 2014. a regard total capital – which, addition loss-absorbing capital, also comprise low-trigger contingent capital instrument – big bank also make great progress; however, yet achieve ratio apply 2019. unweighted capital ratio – leverage ratio – generate different picture. both bank also able improve leverage ratio considerably; yet international comparison base number commonly use definitions, still average large global banks. a colleague thomas jordan explained, economic financial condition swiss bank sector continue challenging. for reason, vital big bank continue improve capitalisation, turn resilience, particularly regard leverage ratio. this especially important leverage ratio grow significance measure bank resilience. in time crisis, particular, leverage ratio often become focus market attention. in snb’s view, top priority big bank consistent rapid implementation “too big fail” (tbtf) regulations. the focus follow areas: first, credibility risk-weighted asset calculation base banks’ internal model strengthened. a outline previously, risk-weighted ratio yield different picture bank’s capital situation leverage ratios. in context, snb currently support finma examination whether extent risk-weighted asset base banks’ internal model differ base standard approach, model-independent. if examination reveal substantial inexplicable differences, would strengthen market confidence model-based approach. conversely, substantial difference cannot explained, corrective measure would need consider implemented. such measure would also boost confidence model-based approach. second, must ensure that, necessary, orderly resolution big bank event crisis. from swiss perspective, emergency plan maintain systemically important function particularly important regard. the emergency plan must credible workable crisis. for reason, big bank continue push forward consistently emergency plans. moreover, global 2 bi central bankers’ speech resolution plan must ensure non-systemically important unit big bank resolve orderly fashion. adjustment group structure, recently announce big banks, represent first step process. an additional tool facilitate global resolution base bail-in concept, subject widespread discussion international level. with bail-in, debt convert equity capital, would enable big bank carry additional loss event crisis. however, effectiveness bail-in essentially depend whether appropriate debt available sufficient quantities, whether characteristic ensure smooth conversion equity capital event crisis. in regard, authority examine extent necessary expand exist tbtf regulation take account swiss specificities. domestically focus banks: resilience lend policy i would like turn domestically focus banks. in switzerland, increase risk mortgage real estate market since end 2012. this development pose great challenge stability domestically focus bank medium term. condition mortgage market, particular, deteriorated. in switzerland, growth mortgage residential real estate continue exceed gdp growth 2013. in first three quarter year, mortgage volume increase chf 27 billion, annualised 4.4%. over period, annual economic output, i.e. aggregate economic output four quarters, rise chf 8.4 billion end 2012, annualised 1.9%. this mean that, switzerland whole, already high indebtedness continue grow fast people’s capacity offset debt income. the situation residential real estate market also deteriorate slightly. depend segment, real estate price rise real term 2.6% 3.5% average since begin year. despite slow momentum compare last year, growth rate still high historical comparison. in addition, overall, price residential real estate increase strongly rent income since begin year. there also sign reversal domestically focus banks’ risk appetite. with regard mortgage lend owner-occupied residential property, proportion new loan high loan-to-value ratio decrease slightly. where affordability risk concerned, however, development identified. moreover, domestically focus bank remain drive force behind strong domestic mortgage growth. while individual bank rein lend considerably compare last year, others maintain high level lend growth, even step lending. finally, interest rate risk exposure extremely high historical standards, whereas average interest rate margin narrow period. on positive note, domestically focus banks’ capitalisation measure regulatory requirement remain historically high levels. however, discuss year’s financial stability report, regulatory capital ratio could overstate banks’ resilience, major risk prevail mortgage real estate market interest rate risk exposure not, partly, take account. against backdrop, bank – irrespective regulatory requirement – continuously ass resilience, make adjustment necessary. they able maintain economically important functions, even real estate price fall sharply interest rate simultaneously rise. over last years, number measure take reduce risk financial stability arise development mortgage real estate markets. the recent measure activation, february year, countercyclical capital buff (ccb). these measure necessary useful. for example, year bi central bankers’ speech 3 large domestically focus bank – citing, among reasons, activation ccb – take step strengthen capital thereby resilience. so far, however, package measure enough prevent build-up imbalance mortgage real estate markets. in environment persistently low interest rates, couple banks’ undiminished appetite risk, danger build-up imbalance remain considerable. for reason, snb continue monitor situation closely, regularly ass whether ccb adjusted. supply secure banknote ensure time now i would like say word subject banknotes. at begin october, inform public that, since autumn 2012, small number swiss 1000-franc banknote circulation issue snb. a know, note abstract production process orell füssli, stage production. out consideration investigation office attorney general, information make public note appear switzerland. a previously announced, possession banknote reimburse nominal value orell füssli. for snb, security paramount production banknotes. orell

the supply secure banknote country been, continue be, guarantee times. we also pursue development new banknote series close collaboration orell füssli. a aware, new banknote series suffer series delays. the snb commit put banknote circulation state art term design innovation technology. our current banknote series unique respect issue mid-1990s. and still high security standard today, result commitment quality. this mean snb pressure roll new banknote series quickly. the new series must meet high security, quality technical production standard – least 15 year first release. so worth take time ensure new security features, complex, technologically innovative never apply banknote design, also stand rigour industrial production processes. a number test currently carry out. the first

remark ceremony commemorate centennial federal reserve act conclude remark mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, ceremony commemorate centennial federal reserve act, washington dc, 16 december 2013. * * * i ask close ceremony mark 100th anniversary sign federal reserve act – law create federal reserve – look ahead next century. give well-known difficulty economist forecast even next quarters, i happily point one important advantage make 100-year forecast, i won’t around explain forecast go wrong. our ability make accurate long-term forecast limited, say least. nevertheless, i venture one prediction i don’t think bold, this: the value sustain serve federal reserve best, permit make critical contribution economic health nation past century, continue serve nation well century ahead. among fed’s important value belief policymaking base dispassionate, objective, fact-based analysis. the ideal seek combination researcher’s intellectual rigor ability effective policymaker navigate messiness real world, world include complex institution markets, imperfect incomplete data, often-unpredictable human behavior. of course, policy analysis implementation high quality happen. they require professionalism commitment public service exemplify generation staff member serve institution well. without expertise creativity embody staff, would impossible

committee – willingness policymakers, past present, whatever need longer-run interest economy. a institution, federal reserve must continue will make tough decisions, base objective, empirical analysis without regard political pressure. 2 bi central bankers’ speech but, finally, must also recognize fed’s ability make implement decision ultimately depend public’s understand acceptance actions. for reason, must continue emphasize two essential value – transparency accountability. we must explain action show serve public interest. that’s must welcome communication, broadly defined. of course, continue talk economist market participants, enough. ultimately, legitimacy policy rest understand support broad american public, whose interest work serve. the ability institution support healthy economy – economy high level employment, low inflation, stable financial system – require continue effort engage two-way communication – explain action and, importantly, listen fellow citizen

deflation speech mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, meet councillor nippon keidanren (japan business federation), tokyo, 25 december 2013. * * * accompany chart find end speech. original presentation bank japan’s website: www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/press/koen_2013/ko131225a.htm/ introduction it great honor opportunity address distinguish gather business leader japan today. there one week leave year. a japan’s economy year, follow recovery path expected, due partly effect monetary fiscal policy (chart 1). during three quarter turn year, real gdp register average annualized growth rate 3 percent quarter-on-quarter basis, substantially potential growth rate estimate around 0.5 percent. business sentiment tankan survey (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) release last week continue show clear improvement and, industry all-sized enterprise basis, get back level peak prior lehman crisis. there also improvement price front year (chart 2). the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi, item exclude fresh food) turn positive june, increase 0.9 percent october, likely slightly exceed 1 percent end year. not rise price energy-related goods, include petroleum products, contribute raise index, also improvement spread wide range item aggregate supply demand balance economy improving. that confirm fact year-on-year rate change cpi (all item exclude food energy) turn positive 0.3 percent october, high rate increase 15 year since august 1998. the bank japan, aim overcome deflation early possible time, introduce quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) april year. today, toward year-end, i express view kind economy society aim overcome deflation look back development japan’s economy medium- long-term perspective. i. the problem deflation the word “deflation” generally understand refer state price decline persistently. since latter half 1990s, japan’s economy deflation nearly 15 year (chart 3). during period, japan’s economy catch various negative shocks: nonperforming loan problem asian currency crisis latter half 1990s, burst it bubble unite states, lehman crisis, great east japan earthquake turn 2000s. in addition, many factor put direct downward pressure prices, inflow inexpensive import good emerge economies, firms’ low-price strategy amid intensify competition associate deregulation, reduction wage level due increase use non-regular employment. while easy specify cause deflation, important deflation result economic stagnation also cause protract economic stagnation. namely, amid nearly 15 year deflation, behavior base 2 bi central bankers’ speech recognition “prices would rise” “prices would moderately decline” embed economy. let explain somewhat detail point. view firms’ side, deflation, cannot raise price product services, sale increase profit hardly increase. therefore, firm restrain labor cost business fix investment much possible. for households, wage increase, consumption restrained. in addition, future price decline, become incline defer consumption much possible. they good buy price decline. if consumption restrain manner, firm force reduce price product services. a result, vicious cycle decline prices, decrease sale profits, restraint wages, slump consumption, decline price continue. what important firm household act rationally respective economic entities. notwithstanding entity take action consider rational, lead bad result whole: state call “fallacy composition” “coordination failure” term economics. japan’s deflation since latter half 1990s typical example that. let u confirm point term macroeconomic indicator since 1990s. nominal gdp nominal employee income able get long-term downtrend since peak 1997 (chart 4). namely, amid deflation, japan’s economic activity nominal basis consistently contracting. such situation quite rare among advance economies. in unite states, nominal gdp nominal employee income maintain long-term growth trends, albeit temporary decline due lehman crisis. japanese firm situation able pas cost relate production sale price intensify competition (chart 5). a price condition tankan survey, since latter half 1990s, diffusion index output price consistently low input prices. a reason difficulty price pass-through, many firm point severity price competition rival firms, thus suggest “fallacy composition” “coordination failure” might take place. at time, firms’ medium- long-term growth expectation decline trend protract period since 1990s (chart 6). furthermore, fact expect growth rate nominal basis low real basis even corporate profit increase substantially mid-2000s tell u persistent deflationary expectation were. also view financial side, protract deflation deprive japan’s economy vitality. first, deflationary expectation embedded, real interest rate obtain subtract expect rate inflation nominal interest rate remain high (chart 7). what matter firms’ decision-making business fix investment development nominal real interest rates. even though nominal interest rate decline, price expect decline trend, investment cost real basis remain high incentive business fix investment wane. in order firm transform innovative idea actual technology products, necessary introduce new machine build new factories. the fact real interest rate remain high amid deflation deprive firm incentive make growth-enhancing investment. second, deflationary expectation embedded, hold cash deposit become relatively good investment even nominal interest rate zero extremely low level (chart 8). deflation reduce rate return risk asset stock investment trust one hand, increase real rate return cash deposits, whose principal guaranteed. against backdrop due partly investors’ long-standing preference toward safe assets, risk money back investors’ search high return lack japan’s financial market, weaken power support firms’ growth financial side. bi central bankers’ speech 3 an aggregate flow fund substantially change past amid vicious cycle deflation. the corporate sector long “fund shortage” sector, investment exceed savings, first half 1990s. firms’ innovation source economic growth, normal state economy corporate sector raise funds, conduct business fix investment, make research development investment. however, since latter half 1990s, corporate sector drastically change “fund surplus” sector, save chronically exceed investment. and firm channel save accumulate every year relatively safe good investment tool cash deposit (chart 9). view bank sector, mean increase liability deposit balance sheet, and, firms’ appetite business fix investment remain stagnant, bank sector could easily increase asset side lending. therefore, bank sector increase investment japanese government bond (jgbs), generate safe certain return even low nominal interest rate (chart 10). in meantime, government sector run substantial fiscal deficit due decline tax revenue repeat implementation economic stimulus increase social security burden stem decline age population. consequently, government debt outstanding continue rise, jgbs issue smoothly, support buoyant demand bank sector. a deflation become protracted, mechanism base assumption price increase embed japan’s economic social system. a i mention earlier, economic entity act rationally lack incentive change behavioral pattern. in sense, deflation state equilibrium. that also call “deflationary equilibrium.” it say deflationary equilibrium become protract become increasingly difficult overcome precisely stable. however, state equilibrium continue forever. above all, one cannot expect long-term development japan’s economy absence firms’ active effort create new businesses. for sake future japan’s economy, critical overcome deflation early possible time convert “bad shrink equilibrium” “good expand equilibrium.” ii. idea behind qqe – drastic change expectation then, economy overcome deflation? the bank’s answer question nothing qqe introduce april. a mention earlier, essence deflation take action assumption price increase rational firm households. to get “deflationary equilibrium,” economic environment need change take action assumption price moderately increase become good option. under deflation due “fallacy composition,” raise price wage one firm disadvantage. a many firm raise price wage simultaneously positive effect economy whole, policy authority come bold policy measure enable firm change mindset manner. in sum, need change rule game prevail “deflationary equilibrium.” to end, bank strongly clearly commit achieve price stability target 2 percent cpi inflation rate early possible time, time horizon two years. besides, underpin strong clear commitment, bank decide enter new phase bold monetary ease term quantity quality (chart 11). furthermore, bank also commit continue qqe long necessary maintain 2 percent target stable manner. in process, bank examine upside downside risk economic activity prices, make appropriate adjustments. the bank totally commit achieve 2 percent price stability target. 4 bi central bankers’ speech a specific measure monetary easing, bank purchase jgbs hold increase annual pace 50 trillion yen, double monetary base two year (chart 12). the monetary base two year late reach 60 percent nominal gdp. that size far exceed current 22 percent federal reserve (fed) unite state 22 percent bank england unite kingdom, thus qqe truly unprecedented monetary ease modern history. the qqe anticipate various transmission channels, differ greatly bank’s past monetary ease policy current monetary ease policy pursue major central bank overseas particular focus “a drastic change expectations.” the qqe aim at, strong clear commitment monetary ease underpin commitment, drastically change market’s economic entities’ expectations, thereby work directly raise inflation expectations. if inflation expectation rise recognition price rise future become embedded, stimulative effect channel decline real interest rate portfolio rebalancing strengthened. namely, first, bank’s purchase jgbs put downward pressure nominal long-term interest rate directly influence supply demand condition jgbs, rise inflation expectation add that, real long-term interest rate decline, thereby strengthen effect stimulate investment. second, inflation expectation rise, relative attractiveness hold cash deposit decline thus expect investor financial institution shift investment risk asset stock foreign bond increase lending. transmission channel effect qqe focus influence expectation nothing process reverse vicious cycle embed deflation. start dispel deflationary expectations, bank aim create embed economic virtuous cycle moderate rise prices, increase sale profits, increase wages, boost consumption, moderate rise prices. iii. raise inflation expectation while qqe focus raise inflation expectations, seem still skeptical view among market participant economist feasibility raise inflation expectation policy measures. to begin with, thoroughly aware central bank cannot change people’s market’s expectations. have say that, here, i would like make two points. first, look history, many case people’s inflation expectation shift dramatically short period, case underpin bold policy regime change implement base policy authorities’ strong resolution. for example, unite state great depression 1930s, president roosevelt clearly show strong resolution toward overcome deflation implement new deal policy (chart 13). by that, inflation expectation shift upward relatively short period, severe deflation associate great depression contained. also japan period, combination expansionary foreign exchange, fiscal, monetary policies, so-called takahashi economic policy, achieve significant result overcome showa depression. while example contain inflation, well know feed chairman paul volcker succeed low inflation expectation aggressive monetary tighten end 1970s begin 1980s, lay sound foundation prosperity u.s. economy low inflation (chart 13). second, formulate inflation expectations, important forward-looking element, bank’s commitment actions, also adaptive backward-looking element, accumulation achievement actual inflation rate increase monetary ease progresses. the year-on-year rate change cpi increase 0.9 percent october expect hover slightly 1 percent bi central bankers’ speech 5 first half 2014. give deflation continue nearly 15 years, important changes. if people actually experience rise prices, inflation expectation suppose change substantially. the bank hold view that, due backward-looking element together forward-looking element, inflation expectation continue rise trend, gradually converge around 2 percent – price stability target. while i say price expect rise gradually, bank aim ensure price stability mean artificially create inflation. a numerical definition bank consider price stability base specific price index 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi. there several reason 2 percent might desirable. first, existence upward bias inflation rate calculate cpi become high true inflation rate. in words, year-on-year rate change cpi 0 percent, situation deflation extent bias. therefore, overcome deflation, necessary aim somewhat positive inflation rate. second, idea secure “buffer” reinforce monetary policy respond price decline economic deterioration. nominal interest rate cannot low zero percent. since low 0.5 percent 1995, short-term rate japan 0 percent 0.5 percent 20 year (chart 14). japan situation difficult stimulate economic activity low nominal short-term interest rate even price decline economic activity deteriorates. in fact, even response extremely large adverse shock lehman crisis, bank able reduce 0.4 percent nominal short-term interest rate. in future, 2 percent inflation achieve stable manner nominal interest rate form somewhat high level reflect inflation rate, room increase flexibly respond price decline economic deterioration reduce short-term interest rate. for similar reasons, many country set inflation target 2 percent, 2 percent become global standard. conclude remark a i explained, bank aim create state 2 percent inflation rate maintain stable manner. it might difficult imagine situation deflation continue protract period. i would like conclude speech today briefly touch image economy society overcome deflation. a state 2 percent inflation maintain stable manner is, put briefly, state economic entity act base recognition price rise 2 percent even economy normal state. in words, state 2 percent inflation factor price-setting wage-setting. such state already achieve advance economy unite state europe, people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation stable 2 percent. a 2 percent inflation firmly embed social system practices, economy able avoid deflation continue decline price wage even temporary downward pressure price wage due economic deterioration. let cite one unique example. in wage negotiation employee employer sweden, mechanism 2 percent inflation target set central bank serf important start point discussion determine wage increase rate establish common practice (chart 15). in fact, sweden, wage rise stably, year-on-year rate change cpi around 2 percent business cycle. japan’s economy see wide range positive development real economy financial market, well improvement people’s mindset expectations. it golden opportunity overcome deflation. let reiterate bank commit pursue qqe achieve 2 percent price stability target early possible 6 bi central bankers’ speech time. i strongly expect favorable move achieve economic virtuous cycle spread business industrial circles. thank you. bi central

bank england, london, 18 december 2013. * * * i would like thank oliver burrows, iain de weymarn, david gregory, david learmonth, varun paul, rhys phillips, laura piscitelli, martin taylor jack worlidge help comments. tonight mark important birthday. we celebrate 20th anniversary bank’s commercial property forum. i delight welcome members, past present, back bank. the forum meet first time 28th july 1993. it host predecessor pen kent. it aim, use pen’s word time, “to bring side industry together” – developers, investors, lenders, occupiers, surveyors, auctioneers, researcher regulator – discus development commercial property sector. since then, forum meet around 80 times. it do three external chairman – clive lewis, chris bartram ian marcus – i particularly grateful effort past 20 years. the forum draw around 300 expert across various sectors. by reckoning, drink 1500 cup tea coffee eat 2000 biscuits. i cannot think bank committee whose caffeine calorific intake could surpass forum’s. that twenty year period far quiet one, bank commercial property industry. the bank gain operational independence monetary policy monetary policy committee (mpc) 1997; role supervise individual firm first strip 1998 then, early year, re-instated prudential regulation authority (pra); and, recently, take responsibility so-called macro-prudential regulation new financial policy committee (fpc). the commercial property industry’s fortune undulating. but throughout up downs, forum remain key source intelligence bank industry important sign cooperation bank industry. since 1997, forum help inform deliberation mpc and, past years, pra fpc. and success forum lead me, three year ago, set parallel residential property forum, chair nick ritblat. some hear say forum one best meet i attend bank. and i know you, hear that, leave wonder meet must like. speak behalf bank, i want say grateful contributions. but forum achieve life? and, look forward, could achieve future? cycle past let start bad news. the forum assuredly solve problem boom bust commercial property market. indeed, environment today – slow recovery jar commercial property bust – eerily reminiscent situation twenty year ago forum began. a yogi berra reportedly said, case déjà vu again. the forum bear commercial property crash early 1990s. between 1989 1993, uk commercial property price fell 27%. this follow long period rise prices, high liquidity, expansive lend weaken credit standards. these ingredient combine create classic pro-cyclical spiral. high valuation support ever-larger 2 bi central bankers’ speech loan ever-finer terms, boost valuation still further. when pro-cyclical spiral go reverse, leave banks, developer investor lick wounds. today, situation much same. commercial property price 37% peak. for secondary properties, like 50% peak. this fall-to-earth come long wave rise commercial property prices, deep liquidity rapid and, many cases, imprudent lend practices. the subsequent crash leave banks, developer investor lick wind case require life support. the commercial property bust contribute several uk bank depart high street economy suffer painful contraction since least 1930s. this pro-cyclical, boom-bust pattern is, course, neither new uk-specific. over past century, uk commercial property market experience five distinct boom-bust cycle (chart 1): 1930s, 1950s, 1970s, 1990s century. peak-to-trough, average price decline 26%. the commercial property cycle appear every bite regular business cycle, one key difference: amplitude perhaps three time greater. that pattern replicate internationally. during crisis, commercial property price fell 22% japan, 29% spain, 34% u 67% ireland. earlier, commercial property lay heart uk secondary bank crisis 1970s, u save loan crisis 1980s, japanese scandinavian financial meltdown early 1990s asian bank crisis late 1990s. during crises, commercial property price fell, average, around 40% often much more. the cost wide economy boom-bust cycle even striking. recession accompany property bust come much high price tag. the cumulative loss output residential property-related recession, example, around three time great plain-vanilla recession around 10% initial gdp. it duration also around third longer. it may over-statement say that, historically, commercial property probably pro-cyclical sector planet. it probably contribute financial crises, associate output job losses, area industry, outside banking. this sober context. cycle future that naturally beg question do avert next time? and role, any, forum might play? i think positive development report. these hold prospect – – next time could different. but successful, measure need industry regulator act decisively concert. let’s start industry. it clear forum’s deliberation industry understand need change. that bring home group forum member come together early year, chairmanship nick scarles, produce “a vision real estate finance uk”. this publish october. the recommendation report make eminent sense. for example, include proposal improve loan-level commercial real estate data. this would improve monitor aggregate exposure sector model real estate risk. the recommendation catch eye relate valuation. valuation lie heart pro-cyclical spiral see historically commercial property market. peaky valuation give appearance safety margin lenders, cause loosen grip credit conditions, thus drive valuation high still. chart 2 illustrate spiral uk. valuation lead lend around year, correlation coefficient around 0.75. bi central bankers’ speech 3 one way slow pro-cyclical spiral would base lend decision spot, medium-term sustainable valuations. any ramping-up property price sustainable value would automatically give appearance safety thereby encourage loose credit conditions. that, nutshell, aim recommendation “vision” document. needle say, work do industry make proposal operational. the first minute forum highlight property statistic valuation two area great improvement needed. twenty year on, remain case today. a continue effort need industry complete job. next, regulators. for much period prior financial crisis, credit asset price cycle interest policymakers extent pose direct risk inflation target solvency individual firms. be bubble blow, likely response combination benign neglect upswing low interest rate downswing. the role policy “mop” flood. that orthodoxy sink crisis. after perhaps large credit boom human history, central bank globally still frantically mop unprecedented degree monetary stimulus. yet even insufficient save world economy “great recession”. and recovery recession slow low almost anyone expected. neglect credit cycle show anything benign. the lesson clear. a policymakers must much good job take prompt corrective action lean financial swing which, allow persist, would otherwise put risk financial system wide economy. we need build defence protect collateral damage financial flood. we need popping, mopping. fortunately, exactly happening. regulator globally pursue wholly new approach. it go name macro-prudential policy. and uk, responsibility bank’s new financial policy committee (fpc). among fpc’s task lean pro-cyclicality financial system. that mean smooth stomach-churning high low credit asset price cycle, characterise past. a evidence approach, consider fpc’s recent action uk residential property market. this market defrost pace past twelve months. the financial stability risk re-heating may immediate, hypothetical. take position uk households. despite post-crisis deleveraging households’ debt burden, relative income, remain high around 140% – almost three time level 1980. a long house price rise fast wages, course year, upward creep households’ debt burden continue. and high debt burden, sensitive household spend eventual upwards adjustment mortgage rates. in way important financial stability perspective distribution mortgage debt. household represent almost 20% debt debt-to-income multiple 5 – is, around 1 million households. around third debt, around 1.6 million households, owe debt-to-income multiple 4. just quarter debt owe household £300 le monthly disposable income essential expenditure take account. and half uk household say would need take corrective action (cutting spending, work long hour etc) mortgage rate rise little 2.5 percentage points, income unchanged. none suggest immediate problem, especially interest rate low. but financial stability protect future tail risks. it backdrop authority recently decide reduce stimulus provide mortgage lend – example, stimulus provide regulatory capital relief bank’s fund lend scheme. a importantly, however, fpc also set stall 4 bi central bankers’ speech macro-prudential measure could take slow accumulation credit debt, point put financial system economy risk. while combination measure may appear modest, represent big philosophical shift past important signal future. regulators, certainly uk, clearly signpost long will turn blind eye pro-cyclical swing property, sector, risk trip economy. we eliminate credit cycle business cycle. but good watch horror, mop hand? we must. the virtue second set instrument well illustrate current environment. macro-prudential measure help guard financial stability risk otherwise associate extra-ordinarily loose monetary policy. in uk, fpc help support monetary policy task drive forward recovery economy, avoid mpc look shoulder fast-approaching financial stability risks. in situation like these, two arm – monetary macro-prudential policy – surely good one secure macro-economic financial stability. and arm attach single body, uk, turn help achieve great coordination monetary macro-prudential policies. there quiet revolution underway uk’s macro-economic policy framework. conclusion on 20th birthday, clear commercial property forum never important. the boom-bust cycle sector simply damage leave free-wheel. it high time develop properly function gear brakes. that done, share effort industry authority – pen’s words, “to bring side industry together”. if successful, forum could ask good birthday present. bi central bankers’ speech 5 chart 1 long-run uk commercial property capital values(a) sources: scott (1996), investment property database bank calculations.

consider risky asset stress test. what could mean italian banks? “i can’t comment this, even parameter decided, yet stress test joint exercise european bank authority (eba). what i say that, general, bank manage risks. the stress test definition stress entire portfolio banks, thus include sovereign debt”. don’t think omt also change perspective, judge government bond detain banks? “i would link two things. the omt obviously consequence price sovereign bonds, extent remove spread certain government pay compensation probability “catastrophic risk” scenario may materialise: probability may leave euro area. stress test never make deal “end-of-the world” scenarios, plausible events, adverse be”. the ecb mention possibility condition ltro, “british style”, “funding lending” ltro, exactly think of? “it clear central bank provide liquidity bank sector, expect bank sector transmit liquidity stimulus, volume prices, economy. but hand cannot really force bank lend real economy problem demand side, perceive risk bank attach loan simply high. you also don’t want liquidity injection lead bank take excessive risk elsewhere. analyst often mention sovereigns, i think that. i think, also draghi said, put “conditions” ltro complicate reasons. for essential analyse risk properly price manage banks”. how’s situation credit market? “on lend real economy, particular need address issue lend small medium enterprises. recently, positive sign evolution lending. the contraction lend non-financial corporation 2.9% 12 month october. this fall consistently, recent period flow new loans, remain negative, show sign stabilisation compare early part year. you also take account bank lend case part total finance company. large firm example tend borrow directly capital markets, issue corporate bonds, market corporate bond well term price new volumes. we also see that, asset side, euro area firm accumulate two trillion liquid assets, largely reflect precautionary save reluctance invest. a profit falling, distribution income shareholder owner cut. large size corporation good place small firms, particularly country like italy” 2 bi central bankers’ speech how address problem? “in contrast country euro area, italy, mark dual industrial structure: one hand many small firms, hand rather small number large large firms. this important credit supply constraint particularly severe small firms, first suffer bank contract lending”. but would suggest? “italy take measure improve situation, like moratoria, make credit condition bite easier, still long-standing severe structural issue solve. you don’t escape big question: it’s structural problem italy make economic reforms. during crisis italy do lot term correct fiscal weaknesses, do enough term economic reforms. the labour market, still need flexibility. labour market legislation need facilitate – hind – capacity business deploy labour force efficient manner. more generally, competitiveness attractiveness country foreign direct investment destination depend “easiness business”, bureaucratic environment, judicial system’s capacity enforce rule law, country’s governance general. without good economic governance solidly place, cannot expect foreign investment return italy. if look last “doing business” index competitiveness, italy extremely badly placed”. so “easiness business” come labour legislation and, general, law bureaucracy. but else changed? “also, unit labour cost high. this mean, course, salary high absolute terms, fact take-home pay low italy average international comparison. unit labour cost high productivity growth low italy. but salary cannot increase unless productivity increases, productivity cannot increase unless overall level competitiveness country improve dramatically. among country sovereign bond pressure, italy one labour cost competitiveness improve relative best performer euro area. this concern, also growth perspective. you see, italy country fantastic human capital, best universities, lot creativity cultural richness. but worrisome difficulty society work together, come agree long-term solutions, redress governance. it seem really big issue”. how situation public finances, opinion? “while still increasing, public debt level good medium term trajectory thank reduce annual fiscal deficit . to keep public debt sustainable path, essential government stick fiscal commitments. this mean fiscal effort cannot relaxed. for example: debt/gdp ratio 100% 2025, would need, 2016 on, primary surplus 4,5% gdp. it possible, country keep primary balance level past, require effort commitment. in respect major achievement put fiscal compact italian constitution. i would also like stress adoption implementation structural reform lead path high economic growth would make possible strong reduction debt give fiscal effort.’’ bi central bankers’ speech 3 but austerity questioned, also imf: country even worsen recession. “the impact fiscal consolidation greatly depend consolidation, whether increase tax cut expenditure example, tax increase expenditure cut. in italy far great focus tax expenditures. one also try avoid penalise labour enterprises. but tax labour reduce spend curtail put tight control. now italy need attentive cut expenditures: point view, seem appointment carlo cottarelli good news, give right signal”. be italy recession? “yes, seem also italy get recession. i think important, show effort pay end, hope. in italy barometer business confidence increasing, important turnaround confidence indicators. society little bite like human beings; wave optimism pessimism, confidence important firm return investment. the turn point still fragile, begin this. that’s always say downside risks, especially structural reform stopped. but see positive momentum build up. many business firm say: see situation improving, reform carry out, it’s still sufficient start really investing. they still wait mood”. italy’s come crisis destroy almost 25% industrial production, bad many country eurozone. “in italy strong contraction productive investments, restrain growth potential income creation. just give idea, investment euro area fall 20% since begin crisis, italy almost 30% since begin 2008. we believe investment start recover 2014. in recovery phase, ecb attentive, credit supply constraint hold back recovery momentum, ready act. contrary happen recession, demand credit normally shrinks, recovery phase credit demand pick up; credit supply follow, could problem recovery. we remain attentive credit supply constrain hind investment recovery”. anti-euro party rising. be concerned? “there fundamental political question here: need le europe? we create internal market working, worth creating. but become clear little europe crisis management crisis resolution, deal particular situation state difficulty. efsf, esm bank union enormous achievements, sense. the new institutional set still complete, it’s go complete time. the crisis become acute europe little europe. and address major problem face”. like recent agreement srm. we welcome deal reach eu finance minister single resolution mechanism, particular allow swift action critical situations. we deem fundamental step towards completion bank union. but process yet complete need finalise soon. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in italy alarm tendency question euro. what scenario, country exit euro? “as president say european parliament, point discuss plan b. furthermore, stabilise euro, discussion reflect reality euro irreversible project. but let say another thing: dream world euro, tend forget really was, before. you remember inflation italy, repeat competitive devaluation – also consequence loss competitiveness cause high inflation – volatility exchange rate, nominal interest rate double-digits, inflation persistently high elsewhere eat purchase power wage pensions. in italy think that. young generation maybe don’t know that, old generation tend forget that. suppose want take risk change currency: imagine contract have, denominate euro sign party become uncertain? all debts, contracts, private public level become uncertain? who pay what, currency, when? you get nightmare widespread litigation. and even scenario people party contract denominate euro allow pay back new liras, imagine costly would borrower discharge debt new currency meantime probably devalue dramatically vis-à-vis euro? instead, need trust stability, europe. and, besides, monetary solution never real solutions. you trust lesson history”. bi central bankers’ speech 1 agus

chairman, yet world-wide negative impacts. from moment end august 2013, massive foreign capital fly economy eventually lead sharp depreciation rupiah. 5. however, observe global issue overshadow economy much broad issue fed’s taper itself. we view are, least, three main global issue create uncertainty put pressure economy 2013. 6. first, uncertainty speed global recovery. the global economic recovery process expected, even slow previously estimated. the global environment become uncertain shift global economic landscape. i still remember, two year ago, discussion two-speed world recovery,

13. in line deterioration balance payment, rupiah demonstrate weaken trend. moreover, hike inflation cause reduction fuel subsidy also part delay adjustment process. these condition finally lead low economic growth. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, [policy response current economic condition] 14. the government bank indonesia take various policy response safeguard economic adjustments. these policy intend maintain economic stability ensure process short term adjustment remain place. in particular, policy response aim ensure stable inflation, maintain exchange rate rupiah line fundamentals, reduce current account deficit toward robust level. 15. within policy directions, bank indonesia attempt strengthen policy mix range from: (i) increase bank indonesia rate 175 bps level 7,50%, june november 2013; (ii) reinforce monetary operation; (iii) stabilize rupiah exchange rate; (iv) strengthen macro-prudential policies; (v) promote monetary financial system stability policy cooperation central banks; (vi) enhance policy coordination government. 16. on behalf bank indonesia, i would like extend sincere appreciation government policy responses. the decision raise subsidize fuel price end june 2013 reduce pressure fiscal sustainability, although effort inadequate improve current account posture. in addition, view government already take initial positive step introduce policy package august october 2013. respect audience, table 2 indonesia balance payment – quarterly 17. without intend complacent, worthy mention policy response demonstrate positive contributions. various indicator reflect economic 6 bi central bankers’ speech adjustment process remain control. the trade deficit start decline third quarter 2013. the foreign capital inflow also intensify [table

avoid [graph 9]. graph 9 bank indicator distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, [economic challenge opportunity ahead] 22. ahead, current challenge recede soon. at present juncture economy adjustment process soft landing, i see number challenges, 8 bi central bankers’ speech global domestic, remain fore. the challenge cyclical nature also structural, therefore demand collective attention. 23. along line, need remain vigilant global economic growth dynamic. while global economy 2014 project expand around 3.5%, shift world economic landscape anticipate continue [table 3]. the average growth u europe, arrive 2.2% 1.4% respectively within last two decades, expect rise 3.1% 1.6% next five years. on contrary, china’s economy subsequent five year accept new normal growth around 7%, expand average 10.25% last two decades. similar pattern expect occur emerge markets’ economic path. table 3 the shift global economic landscape 24. what become concern u risk shift global landscape reverse direction portfolio flow advance countries, particularly u [graph 10]. undeniably, delay reduction u monetary policy stimulus provide “temporary breathe space” u moment. nonetheless, taper u monetary stimulus indeed unquestionable event occur near future. a matter fact, several recent indicator start reflect strengthen u economy. 25. against background global challenges, equally daunt challenge arise domestic front [figure 1]. the first challenge relate financial market need restructured. one issue pertain fragmentation rupiah excess liquidity bank sector. this call attention would increase complexity monetary operation disturb stability financial system. bi central bankers’ speech 9 graph 10 global capital flow figure 1 structural challenge monetary policy implementation 26. another challenge concern financial market lack depth liquidity. in rupiah market, reflect low turnover anomaly price formation repo market [graph 11]. the collateralize market appeal many market participant expensive compare uncollateralized interbank money market. in meantime, foreign exchange market characterize low volume inactive hedge transactions. with micro structure, exchange rate easily pressure even demand foreign exchange experience small upsurge. 10 bi central bankers’ speech graph 11 domestic money market condition 27. the second challenge deal structural weakness inhibit attempt boost economy high level. today, indonesia firm position middle income country transformation low middle income upper middle income [graph 12]. this imply middle class expansion last decade continue correspondingly domestic market enlarge. the structure demand good service also get diverse increasingly complex characteristic [graph 13]. graph 12 income per caput bi central bankers’ speech 11 graph 13 expand middle class 28. notwithstanding, amid change structure aggregate demand, i view economy expand rapidly susceptible correction [figure 2]. the economic expansion also follow weaken posture current account. consequently, pace economic growth high path hindered. figure 2 structural challenge 12 bi central bankers’ speech 29. i view impediment economic growth reflection exist imbalance structure aggregate demand capability supply side. in supply side, production structure take shape within last decade gradually felt obsolete. 30. this actually sensible development [graph 14]. the exist production structure reflect comparative advantage use utilize take indonesia transform low middle income country. the abundant natural resource heritage outside java human resource surplus java become primary asset lift large part society poverty trap. these primary resource enable u build industrial order dominate export industry intensive human natural resource coal mine crude palm oil industry. graph 14 net export natural resource low tech industry 31. nevertheless, indonesia finally step become middle income country grow middle class, industrial order long sufficient. the typical characteristic middle class society desire simultaneously capability purchase good high quality value added. in line increase complexity demand goods, great basis comparative advantage industrial capability undoubtedly needed. 32. this gap demand supply increasingly fulfil imports, primarily good produce middle high technology industry [graph 15]. the net import good category grow large since indonesia step middle income country category 2014. this technology deficit supply side felt across nation. nonetheless, strong industrial capacity java suffice accommodate substantial change structure national demand. bi central bankers’ speech 13 graph 15 spatial profile trade balance nusantara 33. i believe condition stay apart impact several aspect inadequate need improved. first, availability infrastructure connectivity digitally physically. second, management domestic energy. the energy management aspect acquire grow attention augment demand energy fulfil imports, eventually aggravate ongoing problem current account deficit. third, several aspect relate business climate close watch businesses, include ease start business, legal certainty, registration personal proprietary right, insolvency settlement, enforce contract. 34. overall, domestic structural challenge demand increase attention integration asean economic community (aec) loom near 2015. the question u “are able gain benefit aec develop part global value chain, merely become target market?” distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, [general policy direction] figure 3 policy direction 14 bi central bankers’ speech 35. in spirit determination thrust respond challenge strengthen step stone toward sustainable growth, allow convey bank indonesia’s policy direction ahead number think concern structural reformation need pursue together government [figure 3]. 36. let underline policy direction ahead, include period political transition 2014, bank indonesia consistently preserve stability economy financial system. stability need prioritize order create balance sound economic structure, therefore become strong foundation economic transformation future. 37. the economic balance i refer economic growth support sustainable posture current account. on one hand, sustainable interpret condition export high value add industry capable produce intermediate good service far still rely imports. on hand, finance current account derive permanent sources, i.e. foreign direct investment propel growth development advance globally competitive industry sector. 38. with complexity confront challenges, bi’s policy direction measure term goal time dimensions. a regard goal dimension, bi simply commit manage inflation target range, broadly, also direct manage current account toward sustainable path, preserve stability financial system. 39. the effort attain low inflation negotiable become pre-condition sustainability economy. notwithstanding, asian global crisis demonstrate low inflation sufficient warrant sustainable economic growth. 40. the journey economy post 97/98 asian show need remain vigilant even inflation rate remain low, may well delay inflation accompany increase current account deficit. the inflation phenomenon indeed delay since risk rise inflation temporarily absorb government subsidy fuel energy subsidies. inflation rate also subdue owe decrease pressure

stability report presentation mr rodrigo vergara, governor central bank chile, finance commission honorable senate republic, santiago de chile, 3 december 2013. * * * the monetary policy report december 2013 financial stability report second half 2013 find http://www.bcentral.cl. introduction mr. president senate’s finance commission, senator andrés zaldívar, senator member commission, lady gentlemen. i grateful invitation present vision central bank’s board recent macroeconomic financial developments, outlook implication monetary financial policy. this vision contain detail december monetary policy report second-half financial stability report present now. the macroeconomic scenario evolve along trend describe late monetary policy reports. in external scenario, growth balance develop emerge economy subprime crisis hit. international financial condition steadily normalizing, term trade decline approach trend values. in scenario, chilean economy receive mild boost abroad saw recent years. the le expansionary monetary policy develop world couple rebound develop economy favor country world economy large. certainly, country reason worry others adjustment world economy, external domestic vulnerabilities. meanwhile, past present volatility world continue affect economy, but, certainly immune happen outside borders, feel good stand deal transition. at home, output demand gradually decelerate inflation still low. our projections, i review shortly, indicate short term chilean economy continue expand somewhat trend, affect normalization mine investment cycle labor market conditions. we thus estimate 4.2 percent growth year 3.75 4.75 percent range next. this 2014 forecast range slightly le expect september. although growth rate represent slowdown previous years, see obstacle ahead could prevent economy resume growth close trend rates, continue estimate 5 percent annually. in context, board decide low monetary policy rate 5 4.5 percent meet october november, order accommodate monetary stimulus slow economy jeopardize convergence inflation target. the recent reduction mpr part necessary adjustment deal recent change macroeconomy and, i said, ensure compliance inflation objective. go forward, change mpr depend incoming information implication economy’s evolution. actually, baseline scenario foresee need significant change mpr but, need arise, monetary policy room prepare adjustments. 2 bi central bankers’ speech over period, real nominal exchange rate depreciated, part process restructure source growth time domestic demand primary driver growth. let describe baseline scenario main risk identify reports. macroeconomic scenario chile’s third-quarter growth 4.7 percent y-o-y. mine grow strongly, boost startup major investment project recent years. thus, mine export increased, help reduce current account deficit. sector natural resources, meanwhile, continue post low growth rate 2012 (figure 1). this, together revision growth rate early quarters, confirm chilean economy lose strength compare last year. on expenditure side, slowdown extend every component, include private consumption, accompany significant inventory depletion (figure 2). in trajectory, maturation mine investment cycle discuss previous report play major role. in addition, extraordinary import transport material last quarter 2012 continue year, import capital good weak past months. consumption also slow down, although adjustment proceed gradually, still tight labor market conditions, real wage grow strongly consumer expectation still optimistic, although le first half year. the deceleration private consumption expect continue come month couple strong labor market, vision ground business perception report informe de percepciones de negocios. cpi inflation expectations, mainly reflect drop international fuel prices, offset seasonal price increase perishable food peso depreciation. thus, october cpi rise 1.5% y-o-y, place temporarily tolerance range. in contrast, core measure cpiefe bring major surprise continue increase 1.6% annually month. two year ahead inflation expectation remain around 3% (figure 3). in international financial markets, movement last month largely determine news future course monetary fiscal policy unite states. recall that, sign deliver federal reserve last may, withdrawal monetary stimulus expect begin september. this drive long-term interest rate 100 basis point u.s., currency depreciate dollar volatility increased, particularly harsh effect emerge economies. late on, withdrawal occur september, interest rate recede calm return markets. although result improvement external lend standard emerge economies, baseline scenario consider possibility recurrent episode volatility transition towards normal financial conditions. for one thing, temporary nature u.s. fiscal agreement could bring new tension early 2014, although seem le likely. at rate, external lend condition le favorable early year. compare september, long-term interest rate drop federal reserve keep asset purchase plan unchanged, time international stock market improved. several emerge market currency depreciate dollar – chilean peso include – trade $520 per dollar november recently surpass $530. the real exchange rate, i said, rise near 15 20 years’ average. in term outlook global growth, develop economy still process gradual recovery. in third quarter, u.s. exceed market consensus expectation bi central bankers’ speech 3 and, although inventory accumulation play part, improve performance house labor markets, combine good entrepreneurial consumer expectations, behavior stock asset price and, particular, low intensity fiscal adjustment suggest next year country outperform 2013 figures. the recovery japanese economy still ongoing, tax increase announce 2014 taper economic growth. the eurozone post positive growth second consecutive quarter, although le expect consensus. worth note slow growth germany contraction french economy and, positive note, peripheral economy grow again. emerge economy slow consensus forecast see new downward revisions. in china, substantial correction growth projection first half year, recent data show growth stabilize around 7.5 percent, quite le recent years, however. the baseline scenario assume chinese economy slow reach 7.2 percent annually 2015, point need continue restructure source growth resolve vulnerability financial system. in rest emerge world, economic activity continue moderate, lead economy low benchmark rates. others, however, restrict monetary policy respond high inflationary exchange rate pressure relate fiscal, monetary external vulnerabilities. anyway, slow growth expect china, low commodity prices, le expansionary international financial conditions, contractionary adjustment large emerge economy need progress strengthen chinese financial system plus growth re-composition behind vision emerge economy expand slow pace last three years. the baseline scenario monetary policy report foresee that, expand 3.4 percent 2013, trade partner grow 3.6 3.8 percent 2014 2015, respectively, somewhat le think september. in context, inflation expectation emerge develop economies. commodity price dropped. geopolitical tension middle east ease respect month ago, refinery problem unite states, lead low actual expect fuel price compare september. the copper price, remain fairly stable months, post decline recent weeks, price outlook metal remain unchanged previous report. accordingly, baseline scenario assume term trade divert last report (table 1). a i already mentioned, baseline scenario estimate chilean economy expand 4.2 percent 2013, 3.75 4.75 percent 2014, slightly le forecast september. in 2014, gross fix capital formation grow near rate year. a consumption, baseline scenario foresee slight deceleration 2013. this forecast combines, one hand, moderation private income growth, inflation converge 3 percent exchange rate depreciation affect durable consumption. on other, still optimistic consumer expectation strong labor market – although tight year – continue underpin consumption. this scenario assume external impulse similar september’s. furthermore, consider part inventory depletion recent quarter unwanted development, reverse come months. take account weak import strong exports, scenario also foresee narrow current account deficit compare september estimate: 3.2 percent gdp year 3.7 percent 2014. the surprise – positive one indeed – trend anticipate previous reports, come sooner stronger. in particular, maturation mine investment cycle, one main source high deficit due import component, allow copper export grow beyond expectations, capital import begin decline. the estimate current account deficit measure trend 4 bi central bankers’ speech price also adjust downward, risk associate evolution current account identify last monetary policy report reduce (table 2). in baseline scenario, cpi inflation converge 3 percent towards end projection horizon, time last quarter 2015. thus, reach target take long expect september. the cpiefe continue gradually approach 3 percent, without major change september forecast (figure 4). this projection imply nominal wage adjust line productivity inflation target. it also include methodological assumption rer remain virtually unchanged. finally, baseline scenario us work methodological assumption policy rate follow path similar one show late economic expectation survey (figure 5). the baseline scenario reflect event estimate likely occur information hand close report. there risk scenarios, however, materialized, may reshape macroeconomic environment and, therefore, may modify course monetary policy. on opportunity, evaluate alternative scenarios, board estimate risk balance unbiased output inflation. on external front, one risk relate growth emerge economies, particularly china. concern persist fragility chinese financial system, together doubt evolution real-estate price could limit future growth prospects. a note before, china’s evolution cause unrest weight world gdp impact price commodities, copper included. the volatility financial market show recent month imply end quantitative ease u.s. stress-free, especially difficulty calibrate policy action unprecedented process. in regard, major risk effect large emerge economy accumulate macroeconomic imbalance dependent external financing. the risk associate complex interaction weak growth, frail fiscal situation financial problem europe still present. at home, headline inflation recent quarter low forecast, moment expectedly reach target postpone time again. while recent cut mpr help inflation converge 3 percent, widespread slowdown demand component confirmed, along longer-lasting low inflation rest world maybe sharp fall international fuel price could postpone convergence 3 percent. however, depreciation peso still tight labor market could work opposite direction. projection indicate short term chilean economy continue expand somewhat trend still quarters. however, labor market condition fast recovery inventories, among factors, could result fast recovery economy would bring close trend. in financial stability report present today, risk scenario come abroad i identify examined, time perspective impact domestic economy’s financial stability. we conclude three risk scenario described, episode volatility originate monetary stimulus withdrawal likely occur. however, deepen eurozone crisis sharp deceleration systemic emerge economy would strong effect chilean financial system. especially because, i noted, withdrawal monetary stimulus unite state come u.s. economy’s improve growth already confirmed. the bank industry’s capital level adequate remain solvent significant deterioration economic growth financial conditions. stress test show banks’ current capital level allow absorb potential loss generate macroeconomic bi central bankers’ speech 5 risk scenario combine gdp contraction – like subprime crisis – high financial cost short long term, sharp depreciation exchange rate. one test – motivate risk scenario identify process monetary taper u.s. – show little exposure bank system sharp increase interest rate long-term securities. meanwhile, households’ aggregate borrow financial burden indicator show marginal decline, although change composition debt. the share bank debt increase compare credit providers, total corporate debt stable ratio gdp financial indicator company report superintendence security insurance (svs) also fairly stable. capital inflow chile continue dominate fdi aggregate solvency liquidity figure also stable. in way, general analysis domestic financial system yield good stand deal risk scenario described, see incubation systemic risk local level. this explains, part, recent volatility episode foreign financial market less effect chilean financial system emerge economies, risk incubate past years. however, maintain resilience different player make financial system must take necessary decision safeguards, especially consider dynamism financial sector. one first firewall, perhaps important one, one relate corporate stockholders, establish implement clear policy aim restrict operate risk via corporate governance, board management. a second firewall relate public institution superintendence central bank, complementary role monitoring, supervision regulation financial system. the continual improvement regulation laws, well search best practice global level one objective must always present actions. within monitor role, financial stability report play key role. in identify development which, intensified, might create risks, believe room reduce residual risks. i would like describe development well main regulatory amendment implement last six months. in financial stability report couple issue ago warn development real estate sector which, intensified, could become source risk. we particularly concern combination dynamic price credit acceleration originate sector. in context, one good element mortgage credit growth remain stable, relaxation lend standard mortgage loan credit construction real estate firms. however, house price index dynamic previous periods, scenario high demand low inventories. meanwhile, expect supply office space continue rise historically high levels. in context, important player involve consider investment fund decision current price demand trend sector might continue, especially consider external risk described, expect increase supply economic slowdown. while total household debt income dropped, available evidence suggest bank debt remain dynamic, particularly middle upper income homes. to extent bank properly evaluate analyze credit risk inherent segment, source vulnerability. however, factor could contribute underestimation risks. first, roll credit pretty dynamic recent years. second, absence consolidate debtor data base hind household credit risk assessment supervisor supplier – concern bring senate last time present financial stability report. finally, bank recently expand lot consumer loan portfolio see sharp deterioration 6 bi central bankers’ speech npls indicators, consistent great risk take segment. so far, accompany increase provisions. while recent year overall chilean bank system tend reduce dependence short-term wholesale funding, small midsize bank remain highly dependent source. although wholesale fund play important role market discipline, particularly sensitive change perception risk issuer assets’ liquidity secondary market. in addition, event recent year show negative development foreign local financial conglomerate may adversely affect cost fund wholesale market bank belong groups. accordingly, important bank maintain diversify fund base term counterparties maturities. also, bank use liquidity management stress test contingency plan appropriately reflect risks, business strategies, financial condition finance ability different scenarios. in addition, important bank properly internalize economic reputational risk exposure relate entities, proper corporate governance framework crucial. in context, i would like bring attention four regulatory elements. first, superintendence bank financial institution (sbif) perfect regulatory framework corporate governance banks. second, base possible contagion effect financial conglomerate sbif enhance regulation restrict transaction relate debtors, increase supervision tool area. third, relation fund structures, central bank review liquidity rule govern bank order strengthen management policy field, include bind regulatory limit consolidate basis, standardize assumption models, expand information disclosure market liquidity position bank move towards new basel liquidity standards. finally, bill law send national congress institutionalize financial stability board (fsb) important step, grant capability provide space authority monitor risk face financial system coordinate response them. to sum up, chilean economy well position address change internal external condition already seeing. the adjustment observe relative prices, real exchange rate interest rate go right direction facilitate adjustment economy. the board follow closely evolution external domestic macroeconomic scenario implication inflation, reiterate commitment conduct monetary policy way project inflation stand 3% policy horizon. at time, continue improve financial legislation order maintain enhance resilience, issue legally mandated. let end final thoughts. final think a customary presentation senate, try present clearly transparently possible assessment current economic situation implication manage policy tool entrust us. always keep watchful eye compliance mandate given. the chilean economy good stand face challenge ahead, certainly mean feel immune whatever happen beyond borders. we manage economic policy seriously responsibly good times, allow u move relative ease favorable period. the country’s domestic external position strong, financial system limit risks, monetary policy position that, necessary, deal different, complicate phase. in addition, strong fiscal position public debt net term virtually nil, something many country show. bi central bankers’ speech 7 in last two month cut 50 basis point mpr, 4.5 percent. the scenario today see likely envisage need significant additional adjustment policy rate. however, different scenario adjustment call for, room carry out. we, central bank, continue contribute assign duty, is, safeguard stability currency normal function internal external payment system, chile’s development welfare. many thanks, 8 bi central bankers’ speech figure 1gdp growth(annual change, percent)source: central bank chile.-12-8-404812-12-8-40481207080910111213natural resourcesall sectorsfigure

pleasure back committee decisive moment. the next day week end legislature show whether euro area able take another key step towards bank union. i believe institution play crucial constructive role ensure next step entail truly european dimension. this also last time i discus detail matter relate single supervisory mechanism. pending appointment council, danièle nouy become chair supervisory board 1 january 2014. she also become primary interlocutor regard ssm. today, i first review recent economic monetary development euro area. i explain great detail recent monetary policy decision present progress preparation ssm. economic monetary development since meet september, incoming information confirm ecb’s assessment underlie price pressure remain subdue medium term. the economic recovery euro area fragile. real gdp euro area expand last two quarters: from july september, grow 0.1% – quarter quarter – follow 0.3% second quarter year. development survey-based confidence indicator november point toward modest growth rate also last quarter year. at time, unemployment remain high. necessary balance sheet adjustment financial non-financial sector continue weigh economic activity. look ahead, expect output continue recover slow pace. this particular due improvement domestic demand support accommodative monetary policy. euro area activity should, addition, benefit gradual strengthen demand exports. moreover, improvement financial market condition reduce uncertainty seem gradually transmit real economy. finally, progress make fiscal consolidation strengthen confidence market resilience euro area. this also positively affect recovery. nevertheless, risk outlook remain downside. they mainly relate uncertain development global money financial market conditions. high commodity prices, weak expect domestic demand export growth, insufficient structural reform euro area country could also negatively affect economic conditions. annual hicp inflation increase november 0.9%, accord eurostat’s flash estimate, follow unexpectedly strong decline october 0.7%. underlie price pressure euro area expect remain subdue medium term. we might experience prolong period low inflation follow gradual upward movement towards inflation rate below, close to, 2% late on. this reflect modest pace recovery fact medium long-term inflation expectation continue anchor line price stability. 2 bi central bankers’ speech monetary and, particular, credit dynamic remain subdued. the annual growth rate loan private sector stabilise negative levels. weak loan dynamic continue reflect primarily current stage business cycle, credit risk ongoing adjustment financial non-financial sector balance sheets. recent monetary policy decision base assessment current economic outlook, let explain great detail recent monetary policy decisions. in july year, introduce forward guidance clarify orientation monetary policy go forward exceptionally uncertain environment: state expect key interest rate remain present low level extend period time. this statement conditional overall subdue outlook inflation extend medium term, currently case, i explained. in line forward guidance, decide november low key ecb interest rate further. the interest rate main refinance operation low 25 basis point 0.25% rate marginal lend facility 25 basis point 0.75%. the rate deposit facility leave unchanged 0.00%. our forward guidance still remain place: continue expect ecb key interest rate remain present low level extend period time. thus, monetary policy remain accommodative long necessary. adjust interest rate always sufficient maintain price stability. in crisis, interest rate cut transmit slowly unevenly across euro area country due fragmentation financial markets. to address problem, adopt recent year series non-standard measures. the purpose – remain – effective transmission ecb’s interest rate cuts, monetary policy reach company household throughout euro area. this also purpose decision november continue conduct refinance operation fix rate tender procedure full allotment least july 2015. thus, help alleviate fund concern banks, still hesitant lend household firms. two year ago, provide fund support euro area bank two long term refinance operation maturity three year each. a fund situation bank improve significantly since then, bank year opt repay 40% initially outstanding amount. accordingly, excess liquidity overnight money market gradually receding. we monitor potential impact development monetary policy stance. we ready consider available instruments. a usual, take time policy decision work way financial market affect economy. the november decision interest rates, forward guidance prolong full allotment refinance operation work way through. financial market take conditional commitment accommodative monetary policy stance extend period time. money market term interest rate yield bank bond declined. on hand, fully aware downward risk protract period low inflation entails. consistent forward guidance, govern council ready able act needed, i mention recent press conference . furthermore, currently see sign risk financial imbalance relate low interest rate environment. what observe still subdue trend monetary credit development euro area. bi central bankers’ speech 3 nevertheless, observe build-up imbalances, would field macro-prudential authority would intervene market-specific instruments. local risk address local instruments. this supervisory authorities, include ssm, equip appropriate micro- macro-prudential policy tools. i confident use necessary. state play ssm preparation let update late development establish single supervisory mechanism (ssm), well underway. our internal preparation aim ensure ecb ready assume supervisory responsibility november 2014. we make sure ecb’s monetary policy mandate focus price stability affect consideration decision relate bank supervision. internal rule therefore develop separation monetary policy supervisory functions: the unit involve decision-making clearly separated. we put place organisational set-up whereby information flow two function limit “need know” basis. however, avoid unnecessary duplication structure involve decision-making process. this cost-efficient, i sure appreciate this. a regard recruitment staff, i say process senior middle managerial position well underway. further recruitment initiative start due course. an important element preparation comprehensive assessment, comprise supervisory risk assessment, asset quality review stress test perform cooperation european bank authority (eba). this exercise increase transparency enhance quality information available. it facilitate repair sector identify necessary corrective actions. and build confidence assure stakeholder bank fundamentally sound. it conclude shortly ecb assume supervisory responsibilities. the ecb convene series meet november frankfurt bank undergo comprehensive assessment. these meet positively receive provide useful opportunity first exchange views, receive feedback communication, respond questions. we also explain would welcome prompt action banks, begin now, strengthen balance sheet include profit retention equity issuances. other element comprehensive assessment on-going. the process selection asset portfolio review asset quality review initiate november, base specific data collections. furthermore, expect announce key parameter stress test exercise together european bank authority (eba) towards begin next year. in context, let explain treatment sovereign bonds: the asset quality review valuation exercise apply current regulatory framework. it u change framework – global discussion, basel committee right forum it. that said, course “stress” wide range asset part stress tests: sovereign bond among them. to ensure credibility rigour comprehensive assessment, backstop well specify place soon possible. the peck order first private sources, national public backstop and, last resort, european instruments. turn supervision resolution, i understand reach agreement council bank recovery resolution directive. let strongly welcome agreement, important step towards completion bank union. 4 bi central bankers’ speech however, credibility bank union, another step must take too: the ssm need strong credible single resolution mechanism counterpart. responsibility supervision resolution need align european level. thus, i urge council swiftly set-up robust single resolution mechanism, three element essential practice: single system, single authority, single fund. we create single resolution mechanism single name only. in respect, i concern decision-making may become overly complex finance arrangement may adequate. i trust european parliament, together council, succeed create true bank union. thank attention. i look forward questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 luis m linde: reflection road challenge ahead – regulatory change affect bank activity close address mr luis m linde, governor bank spain, ix iese (instituto de estudios superiores de la empresa/business school university navarra) bank sector meet “banks – beyond crisis”, madrid, 12 december 2013. * * * firstly, let thank professor juan josé toribio, president centro internacional de finanzas, invite participate iese bank sector meeting. and allow congratulate iese ninth edition forum become classic consistently great interest high calibre. i go address certain matter important topical, sign recovery spanish economy, initial step launch single supervisory mechanism, asset quality review stress test bank supervise single mechanism. i would hardly anything novel say there. rather, i wish review aspect regulatory change which, crisis overcome, go significantly affect bank activity. three matter concern us: element new basel iii capital accord yet fully finalised; financial stability board’s work regulatory framework treatment systemically important institutions; new power banco de españa draft bill supervision credit institutions, foreseeably approve first quarter next year. i shall begin basel iii. the new capital accord improve comparability and, thereby, credibility capital ratios. basel iii increase capital requirement better-quality instruments, seek consistency uniform application across bank countries. it also add two new prudential tools: one area liquidity, leverage. first, inclusion leverage ratio, relationship tier 1 capital exposure balance sheet, i.e. total bank book, without take account risk weights. calculation make consolidate level and, principle, level set minimum 3%. it schedule come force 2018, although early date probably set require disclosure figure. this new tool design straightforward measure complement act floor minimum risk-based capital ratio. it aim provide additional protection know “model risk”, i.e. underestimate regulatory capital need calculation use sophisticate model allow basel ii iii. on technical side, appear agreement definition calculation ratio, treatment derivative repos, operation ccps. but doubt remain final calibration affect certain business models, specifically centre retail activity. the banco de españa support set leverage ratio pillar 1 understand good prudential tool, correctly calibrated. in respect, monitor period prior entry force provide information experience. although european regulation envisage country may apply ratio deem fit harmonisation 2018, intention banco de españa, principle, bring forward application. a regard liquidity, basel iii add new regulatory requirements: short-term liquidity coverage ratio (lcr), long-term requirement, net stable fund ratio (nsfr). 2 bi central bankers’ speech the short-term liquidity coverage ratio design bank may asset buff meet maximum foreseeable liquidity fund need period least 30 days. a involve safety margin, ratio might time stress 100% maximum foreseeable needs, level demand requirement come fully force. however, bank’s liquidity-generating capacity stand 100% maximum foreseeable needs, oblige inform supervisor, agree plan regain 100% level. the initial design ratio demand and, perhaps, realistic. the year 2015 early date full implementation, definition “high-quality liquid assets” assumption liquidity need overly rigorous. hence, january 2012, basel committee central bank governor head supervision revise accord widen base asset consider highly liquid soften implementation timetable. this regulation also practically finalised, least basel committee, agreement design calibration already reached. the short-term ratio come force immediately. it phase 2015 – level 60% demand – 2019, reach 100%. nonetheless, timetable may speed discretion different national authorities. the banco de españa back set short-term liquidity ratio, amendment it, soften original framework proposed. nor intend accelerate implementation timetable, although believe bank strive meet soon possible. a regard report transparency obligations, consider obligatory internationally active banks, could simplify others. basel iii also envisage implementation long-term liquidity ratio bank maintain stable fund profiles, tailor asset activities. in way, banks’ dependence short-term fund market structurally reduced, since prove disruptive weakness 2008 financial crisis. the design ratio relatively early stage, preliminary proposal publish 2010 revised. it expect that, early next year, consultative document available, regulation finalise 2015, entail simplification original rule. further, necessary agree certain aspect relevance spanish banks, as, relation liquidity requirements, treatment high-quality mortgage matter pertain asset encumbrance. this ratio expect come force 2018, although case eu, commission submit legislative proposal 2016. i shall move certain element relate review capital requirements. this part broad project: attempt ensure benefit risk-adjusted regulations, basel iii, achieve cost introduce excessively complex regulation which, addition problems, yield result cannot compare one bank another. the banco de españa favour simplify current regulations, strike balance simplicity, comparability risk-sensitivity. in respect, view favourably transparency exercise conduct basel committee comparability asset risk weights. the result exercise allow argument make need lessen difference requirement obtain apply standard method calculate use internal models, credibility solvency ratio compromised. however, believe go far abandon use internal models; rather, standardise models, base parameter determine supervisors, use reference internal models. bi central bankers’ speech 3 i also like mention review treatment trade book, aim reduce regulatory capital difference book bank book, thus avoid regulatory arbitrage. at banco de españa broadly concur line work. however, concern review sovereign risk order avoid undesirable effect consequence financial stability, believe wholesale approach taken, one independent isolate respect work group. a review current framework treatment securitisations, i like underscore importance calibration capital requirement associate securitisations excessively conservative, reopen market hamper unwarranted fashion. i would like end comment work basel committee touch briefly another regulatory matter currently review, treatment large exposures. this fall within field prudential measure additional solvency ratio, aim ensure survival bank extreme situations. the review focus treatment exposure third parties, since intra-group exposure postpone time being. the general principle exposure counterparties subject limit base capital bank. that limit set generally 25% tier 1 capital, although certain exposures, systemic banks, stricter. notably, provision make possibility, observation period, limit exposure central counterparties (ccps), although matter open first require assessment effect rule govern relationship bank ccps. let say word main regulatory project financial stability board (fsb) currently working, particularly promote new regulatory framework treatment systemically important institutions, i.e. whose complexity, size interconnectedness failure could cause serious problem global financial system. this new framework rest four pillars: additional loss absorbency, effective resolution mechanisms, increase supervisory intensity resilient financial market infrastructure. unquestionable progress make implement framework. in particular, g-20 approved, new international standard, so-called key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions, comply jurisdiction. in spain, law 9/2012 adopt apply many principle set forth “key attributes”. meanwhile, european union expect adopt bank recovery resolution directive end year, important step forward fully implement “key attributes” member states. on last point, know ecofin currently discuss single resolution mechanism resolution fund. it seem agreements, draft agreements, reach progress make area resolution, determination competent authority. also, difficult complicate issue financing, headway make characteristic propose single resolution fund. negotiation follow course extraordinary ecofin meet schedule next week address matters. let look new power assign banco de españa draft bill credit institution supervision solvency debate shortly. 4 bi central bankers’ speech obviously function power confer banco de españa, i describe shortly, interpret implement take account power european central bank framework implementation single supervisory mechanism. from formal standpoint, draft bill consolidate kind “bank code” regulatory provision creation, activity control credit institutions, thus put end dispersion legislation characterise credit sector various decades. furthermore, aforementioned consolidation aim write spanish law change introduce june 2013 so-called crd-iv package, i.e. directive regulation incorporate basel iii accord european legislation. a know, transposition partly handle promulgation royal decree-law 14/2013, include matter consider essential incorporation 1 january 2014. under draft bill, without prejudice framework result entry force single supervisory mechanism, banco de españa retain current power authorise exercise bank activities. moreover, receive additional powers, revoke bank licences. regard regime govern purchase qualify hold credit institutions, banco de españa continue authority responsible assess proposal potential purchasers, although plan give power supervisory intervention, senior officer replacement, suspension vote right or, extreme situations, licence revocation. a bank supervisor, banco de españa continue oversee compliance organisational disciplinary regulations. to end, draft bill maintain exist inspection verification powers, although changes, require banco de españa carry yearly stress test supervise institution evaluate solvency. additionally, context banco de españa’s prudential supervisory tasks, draft bill equip certain tool envisage eu legislation, include so-called pillar 2 measure additional fund requirements, limitation dividend distribution, restriction certain activity limitation variable compensation. the banco de españa also empower set “additional capital margins” envisage draft bill. the banco de españa continue draw supervisory guidelines. a new development, envisage that, institutions’ conduct comply guidelines, will, require supervisor, explain reason non-compliance. in area sanctions, banco de españa retain current powers, independently power may time exercise european central bank within framework single supervisory mechanism. against background, significant change make generally strengthen regime currently force. finally, draft bill endow banco de españa supervisory, inspection sanction power respect compliance obligation offset, notify reduce risk associate use otc derivatives. to conclude: 2014 will, know, extremely intense year far international financial regulation supervision concerned. there lack work. my best wish good luck. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yuba raj khatiwada: emerge global

bi central bankers’ speech 1 spencer dale: the uk’s economic recovery – now; last; next monetary policy? speech mr spencer dale, executive director, monetary policy, chief economist bank england, confederation british industry (cbi) east england midwinter lunch, newmarket, 13 december 2013. * * * i would like thank john lewis, matt trott gavin wallis considerable help prepare speech. the view express necessarily reflect member monetary policy committee. i think i would start today short reminiscence late eddie george, governor bank england 1993 2003. soon become governor, eddie give interview ask would judge success governorship. now advent monetary policy committee, couldn’t frame response simply term hit inflation target. instead, eddie reply “my personal ambition rate growth output rate inflation three year row”.1 at time, seem fairly tall order: prior eddie take over, hadn’t achieve even since second world war. but turn out, growth strong inflation every single year eddie’s 10-year reign. and continue next year he’d retired. indeed, halcyon day so-called great moderation precede financial crisis, start seem eddie’s ambition long quite demanding. but – know – come crisis! that, combine commodity price boom sharp depreciation sterling, mean day gdp growth outstrip inflation quickly become thing past. we’ve fail live eddie’s ambition past six years. the good news recent development – growth inflation – mean appear head back towards environment eddie would approved. over past six months, output grow annualised rate almost 3%, almost quarter million new job create indicator point continuation strong growth. at time, inflation fall sharply and, 2.2% october, cpi inflation low it’s four years. in term growth, obvious question raise is, now? why, throw everything bar kitchen sink economy past years, economy start grow now? even importantly, recovery last? have see false dawn recent years, recovery really take hold time? and mean monetary policy. in particular, mpc’s so-called forward guidance, announce summer, mean – businessmen woman drive recovery? and that’s plan today: consider three key question economic recovery we’re finally enjoy – now, last, next policy? 1 security investment review, september 1993. 2 bi central bankers’ speech why now? first, now? why several year frustration disappointment economy begin grow? it’s hard certain: time last year predict sharp turnaround growth there’s danger appear wise event. but, least benefit hindsight, two development particular seem important drive turnaround: ease credit conditions; reduction economic uncertainty. let say word each, start credit conditions. improve credit availability although it’s still patchy there’s go, we’ve observe mark improvement ability many company household access credit past 18 month so. some stem lessen tension within euro area, help ease pressure bank side channel. it’s also aid domestic polices, include fund lend scheme, series regulatory action improve strength resilience bank system and, recently, government’s help-to-buy policies. i fully recognise ability many smes – perhaps many today – access credit reasonable rate still remain impaired. but even sense progress made. that’s message survey small businesses, report bank’s agents, indeed i get conversation many business around country. we’re yet – fund lend scheme remain place encourage bank lend companies, particularly smes – take step right direction. for households, improvement marked. interest rate new mortgages, especially fixed-rate mortgage high loan-to-value ratios, fall well percentage point since summer 2012. unsecured personal loan rate fall even more. the great ease many family access credit feed house market, recently state deep freeze. house transaction fell sharply wake financial crisis subsequently flat lined. nominal house price move sideways several years. but past six month so, there’s thawing. house transaction mortgage approval start show sign life. house price pick up. a healthy house market good economy help support recovery. most importantly, underpin increase house building, play important role drive economic growth we’ve enjoy year which, nation, need see. it foster great labour mobility allow people move easily new job created. it help support consumer confidence. but let’s naive. anyone pass interest british economic history aware uk house market sort microwave type quality it, tendency turn lukewarm scald hot matter economic seconds. the bank fully aware risk. the good news, however, it’s far good equip respond type risk past. in particular, new financial policy committee (fpc) – sister committee mpc – explicit responsibility maintain resilience financial system. and, together regulatory bodies, fpc policy instrument address potential excess house market – market – pose threat stability financial system. so although risk go, particularly smes, credit condition many company household ease past 18 month help stimulate activity, particular within house market. consider next reduction economic uncertainty probably play great role turn economy around year. bi central bankers’ speech 3 reduce economic uncertainty it seem clear economic uncertainty diminish past year so. think back, example, middle last year, euro area appear teeter edge. or even recently begin year, talk home possibility triple dip. to some, appeal “reduced uncertainty” driver economic recovery may sound rather vague nebulous. a convenient ex post rationalisation perhaps something don’t really understand. but seem clear uncertainty fear greatly amplify initial impact financial crisis.2 how else, example, explain speed failure u investment bank september 2008 lead output order country, indeed around world, “falling cliff” within matter months?3 more generally, speak company recent years, i’ve leave doubt heighten uncertainty serve significant brake activity plan expansion. and good reason. most obviously, face great uncertainty economic outlook, many company may hold undertake new investment start new venture wait uncertainty partially resolve decide whether go ahead. the value wait – keep option open – especially mark consider lumpy investment project hard costly reverse made.4 uncertainty may delay action investment within companies, even manager wait resolved. take, example, company decide whether invest in, say, new it system. it may current level order activity, it’s close call whether investment pay off, decision put hold order increase sufficiently tip balance decisively. but suppose economic outlook particularly uncertain, company unsure whether, even order rise, strength would continue. in case, company likely require even big increase order take plunge. a result, heighten level uncertainty tend push aggregate investment.5 more generally, many company face uncertain economic outlook may adopt defensive strategy, hunker ensure survive economic storm. sure, may mean defer potentially profitable business opportunity while, good risk long-term future. in context, it’s worth remember it’s 2 for detail discussion role increase uncertainty may play contribute depth recession, see recent article abigail haddow, chris hare, john holley tamarah shakir (2013) bank england’s quarterly bulletin. 3 this phrase use mervyn king evidence treasury select committee november 2009: “at begin year experience two quarter world economy, word people around world used, fell cliff”. 4 for example, dixit pindyck (1994) show company undertake investment project net present value must merely positive, must great imply option value wait next period. 5 bloom (2009) show high uncertainty tend lead low investment widen “zone inaction” associate company wait economic environment move decisively direction other. the partial irreversibility investment mean company margin decide whether invest correspond disinvestment margin. widen region inaction cause new investment disinvestment cancelled, hence low total investment. 4 bi central bankers’ speech successful company bright future likely affect way, since lose.6 a i said, good news cloud uncertainty start lift. and heighten uncertainty greatly amplify downturn, reduction uncertainty provide powerful spur recovery. this lead second question today: recovery last? will last? the reduction uncertainty ease credit condition appear start unlock pent-up demand fuel recovery. that recovery date largely drive household side: high-street sale increase modestly consumer spend great share pay, investment residential house increase significantly. the dominant role household sector early stage recovery particularly surprising: business likely need sustain pickup demand either need confidence increase capacity. but durability recovery depend baton growth hand corporate sector, whose spend investment help foster strong growth productivity real incomes. and reduction uncertainty may continue play important role. it’s perhaps easy see reduce uncertainty may help prompt one-off increase business spending, company move away defensive, wait-and-see strategy blow cobweb plan defer investment projects. but impact diminish uncertainty may stretch beyond simply short-run boost. in part reflect possibility combination reduce uncertainty increase spend household company may become self-reinforcing: reduce uncertainty help spur additional spend investment, turn reduce uncertainty future demand on.7 movement uncertainty amplify recovery amplify downturn. this virtuous circle may enhance benefit reduce uncertainty supply-side economy. increase investment add productive capacity. a strengthen labour market may give employee confidence move jobs, good align available skill vacancies. company may lift shutter start take type risk entrepreneurial activity necessary long-run prosperity.8 such improvement supply performance economy would greatly enhance durability recovery. diminish uncertainty may also bolster impact past ease monetary policy. the mpc loosen monetary policy aggressively since financial crisis, cut bank rate historically low level use unconventional tools, 6 the cost associate bankruptcy mean that, time high uncertainty, firm may opt adopt strategy robust view world prove wrong, sometimes refer “robust satisficing” (see ben haim (2010) overview). 7 my colleague david mile (2013) make similar point recent speech. 8 bloom et al (2001), bond lombardi (2004) gilchrist et al (2010) discus constrain impact uncertainty business investment. reduce uncertainty may also make company will enter new markets. disney, haskel heden (2003) provide evidence activity important source productivity growth. lazear spletzer (2011) show reduce uncertainty prompt great “churn” labour market lead efficient match skill jobs. bi central bankers’ speech 5 quantitative ease fund lend scheme. but if, recent years, many company largely focus survival, wait uncertainty resolve actively consider opportunity invest expand, it’s possible ease borrow cost bring policy yet fully translate spend decisions. a uncertainty lessens, past monetary policy action may gain great traction, thus support recovery. so good reason think reduce uncertainty may help facilitate handover business spend need see, effect may long lasting. but also need alive possibility event past year may colour contaminate business behaviour many year come. it may long time company look ahead confidence period remarkable stability prior crisis. before trust restore authority able stop really bad thing happening. before rebuild relationship banks. on final point, many company let bank financial crisis, i fear many reluctant return business model rely bank provide liquidity support time need. the reluctance today company borrow bank may le lack demand breakdown trust. although understandable response event past years, increase prevalence self-insurance good efficient function economy. the scar effect financial crisis uncertainty bring it, together fiscal consolidation weakness euro area, likely continue weigh recovery next years. yes: economy appear turn corner. and yes: good reason optimism recovery persist. but can’t take granted: there’s still long way go. and sense far go underpin policy guidance provide committee early year take u third final question: next monetary policy? what next monetary policy? the primary objective monetary policy remain hit government’s 2% target cpi inflation. despite miss target much past five years, i’ve doubt credible nominal anchor provide serve economy well crisis. indeed, without credibility wouldn’t possible loosen monetary policy aggressively order support output jobs. a seen, good news inflation fall sharply past month 2% target sight first time 4 years. but isn’t time complacency. to repeat, inflation 2% target past five years. there good reason policy wasn’t tighten order bring inflation back target quickly. but ultimately, mpc judge success actions, elegance arguments. we need demonstrate commitment bring inflation back target keep there. but also need trade speed bring inflation back target support monetary policy provide recovery. the mpc’s forward guidance give great clarity view appropriate trade-off. more important u today, guidance root recognition it’s long way back economy fully recovered. the damage loss associate financial crisis year frustration disappointment follow won’t reverse simply one two quarter strong growth. our guidance make clear intend maintain current exceptionally stimulative stance monetary policy we’ve 6 bi central bankers’ speech see sustain period strong growth margin slack economy narrow significantly, long pose risk either price financial stability. a may know, guidance frame term so-called threshold knockouts. the mpc intend raise bank rate reduce stock asset purchase least unemployment rate reach threshold 7%, subject three knockout design guard risk price financial stability. but abstract detail threshold knockouts, message – businessmen woman drive recovery – clear. you plan future knowledge mpc intend keep interest rate low see prolong period strong growth, unemployment significantly lower, real income higher. base reporting, might forgive think forward guidance far complicate this. to take one example, let read open sentence article last month report mpc’s november inflation report. under headline “forward guidance fails”, article began: “the bank england expect economy grow strongly next year, highlight fact policy forward guidance effectively failed.” strong growth, fall unemployment: that’s failure, i wish i’d fail long now! the aim committee’s guidance isn’t provide commitment interest rate won’t rise particular date future. monetary policy respond change state economy. we commit keep price quantity unchanged irrespective economic circumstance can. rather, guidance reassure that, absent risk either price stability financial stability, tighten policy well along road recovery. yes: interest rate rise point. but far strong economic backdrop, output higher, order book fuller, customer good able withstand rise borrow costs. moreover, although still way distance, shouldn’t look prospect eventual rise interest rate sense dread fear. assume interest rate rise due vigour durability recovery, rather concern either inflation financial stability, see interest rate begin rise sign strength economy. a sign well way make full recovery. a sign emergency life-support measure put place since crisis long required. the mpc fully aware extraordinary low interest rate likely need time yet. but cease be, sign finally turn corner home. conclusion let summarise at long last, appear move back economic environment eddie would approved. one economy grow robustly inflation close target. a recovery appear finally take hold, spur reduce uncertainty easy credit conditions. there good reason optimism recovery durable. but journey back full recovery long many challenge still remain. monetary policy long haul. that essence forward guidance. bi central bankers’ speech 7 reference haddow, a., hare c.,

examine bad excess casino bank abroad, declare politician – u tonight – “banks incompetent behemoth wait public bailouts connive profiteers, pull fast one customers”1 the economist might think that… but i could possibly say so… could i? a well know, banks, here, too-big-to-fail, engagingly customer-friendly, time. and good be, i please see competition really hotting up. even i speak, half dozen different application bank license pending – record number us. 4. elsewhere, banker trade recklessly − people’s money. they guilty libor rigging. you would think forex market – large liquid market world, daily trade volume usd 4 trillion – would immune market-rigging. well, would wrong! bank forex trade desk fix that, too. banker may yet find guilty commodity price rig well. they make whole country break huge cost bank bailouts, spread misery devastation. you know, it’s almost foreign banksters trader take hollywood vamp, mae west, mentor. remember quip? “between two evils, i always pick

follow advice ivana trump give wrong wives: “don’t get mad: get everything!” move close home, believe bash like dinner tonight could complete without dose bank bash – i wonder why? let assure item menu tonight! what sigh relief i hear banker present here! my subject tonight real economy mauritius future. doe need makeover? lift eye future 9. how well doing? let u step back little gain perspective. let’s measure progress think would vision 2020 fifteen year ago, i privilege develop many you. many you, present tonight, contribute develop vision 2020, look ahead country could become span 25 years. ownership could widespread. in probably unique feature, vision 2020 bridge party-political divide. conceive conduct prime minister sir anerood jugnauth – actually attend work meet entire cabinet − deliver prime ministership dr navin ramgoolam give ring endorsement enthusiastic preface, commend final report nation. 10. vision 2020 remarkable come pass. since december 1990, gdp grow nine-fold, gdp per caput shoot rs37,000 rs266,000 − seven times. we spot predict tourism ict would emerge major contributor job incomes. they account average 8.2% 6.4% gdp. in parallel, king sugar dislodge pedestal, fall 10.3% gdp 1990 1.6% 2012. manufacture also fell 23.6% 16.7%. a anticipated, economy transform service-oriented economy, weight service sector increase 57% 1990 73% 2012. our openness readiness adapt globalisation pressure maintain competitiveness, saw u judiciously combine foreign labour domestic labour force. the share foreign labour total employment thus increase 0.2% 1990 4.1% 2012. our transformation remarkable. 11. i believe vision 2020 serve guide star economic operator policy-makers set separate, convergent, way address succession bi central bankers’ speech 3 obstacle encountered. obstacles, course, always be. the international environment confront u today extremely challenging. uncertainty increased. so competition market share country adjust new competitive requirement global supply chains. 12 a edge way still-lingering financial crisis, i believe time ripe u embark new visioning project look beyond vision 2020 realise promise potential. our public-private partnership gain maturity. i see reason thrive private sector cannot take lead set perspective future. don’t wait government. set think-tank strategic issues. let government facilitator change. i believe reach stage development best flourish government respond strategy, initiatives, vision. this call private sector partner tonight, re-echoing call launch vision 2020, private sector take lead future national visioning exercises. extend miracle 13. we might begin ask well respond current challenges. a new imf work paper mauritius, tauntingly entitle “mauritius: the driver growth – can past extended”?2 examine growth record economy rev average growth rate 2.4% 1960’s 6% 1970’s, decelerate 4.4% 2000’s. it us growth-accounting framework decompose respective contribution capital labour. it dissect source past growth, project growth 2030. it conclude growth likely 3–4% range. it could possibly reach 5% happen strong pro-active policy take five areas. first increase investment rates. second come increase save rates. third labour market reform. fourth education reform. and fifth need reform reduce bottleneck increase productivity. except much-needed increase domestic save rate, alarmingly 15% − nearly half historical peak – measure structural nature within domain monetary policy. the bank long fight normalise interest rate induce great save effort much time, aware, unfortunately lose battle. 14. to return question put, past mauritian “miracle” – extend future? how institution faring? be get best state-owned enterprises? they command large chunk national resource impact national competitiveness. be enough bench-marking best world? how far firm cut costs, increase competitiveness, improve productivity? embarrass answer may be, question must confront head-on “the miracle”, is, project generation come? 15. the message past adaptation disaster. in last two decades, commerce banking, confront seem miracle technological change. we microchip, fibre-optic cable, world wide web, satellite media, smart phone, cctv systems, videoconferencing, call centres, on-line sales, nano-technology, on. some quick pick kit adapt needs, much old mauritius still surround us, reluctance change. 2 svirydzenka k., m. petri, “mauritius: the driver growth – can past extended?”, imf work paper, october 2013 4 bi central bankers’ speech innovation bank 16. in banking, i please report, midst of, merely spring cleaning, veritable bank reformation. it reformation embrace instant digital process trade bill exchange, letter credit, emergence global payment settlement system. mobile payments, electronic wallets, internet bank stay. we move paperless bank and, indeed, cashless society. a new digital currency, bitcoin, make headline year, challenge governments’ monopoly issuance currency. which mean even new polymer note may go way dodo. the financial management commerce bank transform generation best business. but part new mauritian miracle, must beware leave out. the legacy global crisis: central bank take hit 17. even ready face new threats, legacy global crisis still much us. many central bank take hit. first, revenue derive reserve portfolio, source revenue central bank, come tumble down. it fell r 2.1 billion fy 2006/07 r 794 million fy 2012/2013 average annual yield decline 4.4% 0.8% years. second, hefty bill come 2012 rescue job bank protect inherently vulnerable small economy global crisis. allow sketch reality cost action take prop economy maintain financial stability mauritius. 18 the rupee get line economic fundamentals, gradually become overvalued, begin affect trade. we option step intervention forex market combat currency appreciation. we limit firepower – fact obvious time policy-makers incline believe bank could print rupee require buy flow foreign currencies. the constraint come leg operation. to prevent disruptive effect flood rupee liquidity financial bank sector stability, bank buy rupee issue instruments. the cost instrument multiple yield currency purchased. by way example, let u take u dollars: reserve currency yield 0.3% average 2012. the average cost incur bank sterilise proceed forex purchase stand 3.4% year – ten time higher. 19. central bank loss expect much heart initial reluctance intervene. we support imf recommend cost process sterilisation bear fiscal authority front, without wait recapitalise central bank incur losses. it understanding, issue twice volume bank security normal level. that indeed ten time capital holdings. our 2012 rescue job currency front cost u nearly rs20 billion bank paper – ten time capital. but seem work although yet woods. orr rescue 20. our rapid response, operation reserve reconstitution, halt reverse appreciation rupee, keep export machine go economy purr along normally. but central bank take quite hit. and i must emphasise tonight neither pace level orr-style intervention sustain bank resources. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the fiscal expectation monetary agent 21. we were, course, alone force play active interventionist role – pay consequences. brazil protest “currency war” declare surreptitiously. it slap tax inward capital flows. the swiss central bank almost lose shirt trying, successfully, contain appreciation currency, much displeasure cantonal shareholders. last month, australian government make massive capital transfer reserve bank australia allow sustain open market operations. india suffer severe bout rupee depreciation, together capital outflows. zimbabwe take debt central bank – another story. 22. when “tapering” begin earnest, world confront new challenge return “normal” monetary policy. it’s safe bet still currency volatility follow, even vigorous action necessary stabilise affect currencies. but central bank balance sheet cannot keep take hit like this. they cannot continue rescue private sector balance sheets, prop economy, go themselves, unsustainable losses. central bank need extra card sleeve. 23. topmost among these, i would place additional capitalisation, resourcing, central banks, australia, without wait actually make loss first, norm central bank legislation. dynamic provisioning, fly face account practice, equally important. this would allow u carry battle currency volatility, conduct open market operations, omo’s, low-yield environment. without extra resources, omo’s central bank able undertake be, open market operations, open mouth operation – money put mouth is! 24. a i reflect time “tapering”, astute observation former chairman u federal reserve, william mcchesney martin (jr), come mind: “the job feed take away punch bowl party get going.” i suspect macroprudential measures, introduce recently, minimise risk overheat construction sector, must evoke similar sentiment industry. the bank see killjoy, prevent enthusiastic promoter turn whole country gigantic build site. where see benefits, bank see risk, capital r. ignite new engine growth 25. but let u end dismal note hope high steady recovery. i believe mauritius move premier league small states, become one tiger tomorrow’s commerce, ignite new engine growth. 26. writing, 1940’s, william henry beveridge, social reformer extraordinaire, define road progress elimination five giants, want, disease, ignorance, squalor idleness. we do much mauritius eliminate want, disease, squalor. we still much work ahead tackle vigorously giant ignorance idleness. we absolutely must increase savings; reform public sector make servant master people; engage woman society, business indeed banks; extract great efficiency education health; develop great productivity innovation economy. 27. i believe shall see driver growth sustain must more, much more, ignite innovation business mauritian society large. the mauritian miracle thing past. but require new spirit adventure match talent opportunity cyber age. we must overcome new threat concert 6 bi central bankers’ speech pursuit macro-economic macro-prudential policy. only secure economic financial stability growth equity. the key future prosperity 28. the key future increase personal corporate accountability multi-sector collaboration. we need private sector take lead role. we need stimulation nurture new start-ups. we need challenge monopoly past. we need slimmer, effective efficient public sector, seriously need reform. some task there! for well said: “reorganising civil service like draw knife bowl marbles.” 29. but race ahead path, hold forth torch new technology, must face many risk cyber age. and this, i please see, many bright banker take lead. for, need continue positive role highly competitive bank sector even close effective work relationship real economy. and need inclusive management public private sector. here i’m remind story great british military leader, duke wellington, vanquish napoleon battle waterloo 1815. late become prime minister find government hard nut crack. after first cabinet meeting, hear remark: “i give orders, then, damn it, sit start discus all!” hat local banker 30. so, let’s take hat local bankers! they never part casino banking. and long history serve nation customers. a central bank proud 46-year history: imagine much must le grandes dame de la place d’armes!. mcb inaugurate 1838; hsbc 1916; barclays 1919. that span 175 years, decade decade experience skill, serve people country. the state bank mauritius − many may aware, actually promote bank mauritius country’s independence − upstart comparison. and successful one, too. the brilliant new star bank scene keep establish banker toes. i say banker tonight, hat all. the fundamental law unproductive state 31. finally, wont occasions, may i leave two law may possibly inspire u pursuit second mauritian miracle. in past served: maradona’s law interest rates, einstein’s law success, newton’s law physical response, amongst others. for delectation, i even roll sutton’s law, name bank robber explain rob banks. 32. in vein, i turn parkinson – no, i refer parkinson give name debilitate disease figure high risk map human advance years. i invoke another parkinson, cyril northcote parkinson, turn attention equally-debilitating disease affecting, persons, institution corporates. parkinson’s law triviality may strike home habitués board rooms. it state that: the time spend committee item agenda inverse proportion sum money involved. bi central bankers’ speech 7 33. this trivial item, like allocation park spaces, colour new uniform staff, dominate discussion board. this leaf time review strategic item multibillion capital scheme. the big issue wave nod. member board exhaust triviality realise must break lunch! 34. now, approach festive season, trader vie one another sale gimmicks, i think i persiflage. may i therefore offer two law price one? i couple law triviality parkinson’s law organisational pyramid. it state that: the number subordinate organisation increase linearly 5% year, regardless amount work done. we might call middle age spread middle income trap! 35. finally, i leave ruminate parkinson’s laws, i shall conclude, ineffable law stand warn u all. but escape pernicious embrace, i believe, long-term future miraculous past. to achieve this, must work together. we must put aside trivialities. and, all, must give strategic think visioneering, priority national agenda economic operator political decision-makers. it high time look beyond vision 2020. bi central bankers’ speech 1 deepali pant joshi:

bundesbank, german embassy, paris, 11 december 2013. * * * lady gentleman let kick discussion offer think current state play europe, euro area particular. many challenge overcome, yet still remain ahead. let mention them. first, market still concern quality banks’ balance sheet possible forbearance policies. the lack transparency true asset quality certainly issue. price-to-book ratio le one testify this. second, true see significant improvement market access fund cost recent months. however, sign fragmentation so-called periphery country euro area still evident. that is, finance condition sovereigns, bank corporates continue diverge along national borders. third, many part europe necessary deleveraging process still continue. the corporate private household sector european economy still riddle debt previous exuberance. likewise, public deficit sovereign debt level uncomfortably high many countries. finally, growth, measure annual basis, euro area remain subdued. the european commission expect euro area real gdp shrink 0.4% 2013. and 2014, growth may well amount mere 1.1%. this add challenge face bank balance sheet public finances. so, gloom doom? far it, i would argue, long policy maker take right steps. let u take short look do far remain done. let begin issue monetary policy, would probably expect central banker. only would dispute measure take eurosystem greatly reduce tail risk financial markets. however, i cannot conceal concern measure come diminish rate return. in fact, may soon reach point risk outweigh benefits. in end, monetary policy cannot solve crisis. everyone agree this. all monetary policy buy time. and eurosystem enter unchartered dangerous territory. thus, policy maker make good use time monetary policy buying. and indeed, europe proceed comprehensive reform agenda tackle root cause remain challenges. one challenge close link bank sovereigns. break link important make euro area stable. to achieve objective, adjust regulatory treatment sovereign exposure medium term. two step important: first, upper limit banks’ exposure individual sovereign introduced. second, banks’ investment sovereign bond back capital. but do. a bank union represent another major step break link bank sovereigns. centralise supervisory power large bank foster 2 bi central bankers’ speech comprehensive view unbiased policy action hold hostage national interests. a first step direction balance sheet assessment auspex ecb. it important conduct exercise impartial unprejudiced manner. the german bank industry already spend considerable effort clean balance sheet – part commission’s state aid decisions, reaction eba stress tests, reason. thus, bank good condition year ago. i afraid huge surprises. but bank subject assessment cannot exclude problem still remain. we need uncover address problem now, single supervisory mechanism launched. meanwhile, comprehensive bank union comprise effective single supervisory mechanism. it need complement single resolution mechanism. this necessary step solve too-big-to-fail-problem. large bank must able fail without endanger stability whole system. otherwise, government would step prevent systemic crisis. this would create asymmetry: heads, bank win, tails, taxpayer lose. against backdrop, establish clear hierarchy minimize discretion handle bank creditor bail-ins indispensable win back lose trust. base eu finance ministers’ agreement june 2013, recovery resolution directive close adopted. it might ultimately turn net positive, provide clear orientation markets. moreover, might even positive effect banks’ finance conditions. there doubt bank union major step forward design good framework monetary union. however, also need structural reform national level key restore competitiveness sound public finances. it certainly true reap fruit success come time lag. but experience germany – ten year ago nickname “sick man” europe – show benefit come fore sooner later. and lately, growth data euro area indicate silver line appear horizon, macroeconomic rebalancing euro area underway. importantly, euro area leave recession, 0.1% growth third quarter. in, italy greece contraction slow down, spain join portugal ireland leave recession behind. at time, export increasing. all crisis country – except cyprus – project see export growth year, range 1/2% ireland almost 6% portugal. these achievement reflect current account revert positive balances. competitiveness also improve peripheral countries. since 2009 greece see unit labour cost diminish 8%, ireland, spain portugal unit labour cost decline 11%, 7% 6% respectively. the structural reform implement key explanation successes. thus, center crisis, situation improving. but two large economy euro area; france germany? look france, see good potential: country home many renowned firms, strong domestic market, favourable demographic – particular compare germany. however, also face structural challenges. the unemployment rate stand 10% france’s world market share export decline significantly past bi central bankers’ speech 3 10 years. and despite consolidation effort past years, public debt stand 90% gdp – level could become significant burden economic growth. additionally, france acknowledge importance competitive economy. the government embark number reform increase competitiveness economy. furthermore, social partner agree labour market reform could important step toward achieve good function labour market. look germany, current situation seem quite pleasing: germany’s economy infinitely good shape ten year ago. nevertheless, i believe need level-headed assessment – germany, too, face structural challenges. there four important area address: first, germany cope unfavourable demographics, increasingly felt come years. second, due globalisation firm go face increase pressure emerge market competitors. third, fiscal policy bring high public debt. and fourth, germany try completely change energy policies. this change profound impact competitiveness industry purchase power households. thus, focus country center crisis might distract u fact country europe face structural challenge – include france germany. at end day, europe work u move direction. only together france germany act drive force european integration. and together france germany help solve current crisis. the positive development i highlight speech show payoff stay path reform. and give u necessary back european know need done: use window opportunity relative market calm. use push forward reforms, both, national european level. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: interview le journal du dimanche interview mr mario draghi, president european central bank, le journal du dimanche, publish 15 december 2013. * * * be europe finally return growth? growth returned, certainly strong. it modest, fragile unequal. germany well; france, italy spain improving; thing go well netherlands; greece portugal remain pressure. unemployment still high, seem stabilise average around 12%. we forecast growth euro area 1.1% next year 1.5% 2015. what drive recovery? look figures, see export pick – new development – consumption recovering. various factor play role that. first all, monetary policy, remain accommodative since 2011, process bear fruit. the commitment make regard future direction monetary policy decision november reduce rate main refinance operation 0.25%, second reduction 2013, also contribute that. uncertainty receding, help stimulate investment encourage bank lend. purchase power also improve result decline energy food prices. do think line need draw greek debt order country get current situation? the reform programme put place aid imf commission liaison ecb seem bear fruit. we examine greece’s budgetary situation development start year. the greek people already make large number sacrifice i hope country achieve budget surplus (excluding debt burden) next year. nevertheless, reform continue. do believe bitter pill austerity impose country euro area order tackle debt crisis right solution, acceptable response? austerity essential, necessary solution one serious financial crisis ever seen. prior 2010, world live somewhat unreal. our creditors, institutional investors, differentiate credit greece credit germany. when people begin doubt regard greece’s solvency, come end. institutional investor begin re-evaluating risk profile country eu. we know happen next: spread lend rate begin increase, distinguish country judge safe (and therefore creditworthy) rest. this crisis teach u lesson. it teach u cannot generate either sustainable growth fair distribution prosperity amass debt. it also force u focus fundamental order check solidity individual economy. that realise time structural reform come. without crisis, could give time implement them, could accompany austerity plan stimulus measures. but do time, reform implement matter urgency painful manner. 2 bi central bankers’ speech pierre moscovici, minister economy, belief france victim “french bashing”, reduce deficit undertake fundamental reforms. what think? major effort made, important france continue along path reform already undertaken. the government french people aware this. competitiveness remain insufficient, improvement public finance must stop base tax rises. france need return fiscal stability firm start invest again. should germany, true engine european growth, share fruit growth neighbour order foster broad-based recovery? the real issue slightly different. we need try understand germany good neighbours. the answer germany give mean competitive thank bold structural reforms. in early 2000s, germany launch labour market reforms. it remain example eu country follow. it performance base great strength small medium-sized enterprise (smes), export innovating. that platform need preserved. but germany rest laurel need foster investment, particularly investment infrastructure. what prospect europe, give growth long create jobs? unemployment indeed number one problem government eu country – start youth employment. we incline think industry remain key driver employment, reality service create jobs. that partly service le expose competition industrial sector. bank criticise cease finance economy. what encourage them? two year ago provide €1,000 billion form three-year loans, already repaid, since reduce key interest rate several times. bank able refinance loan firm use fund obtain ecb. that give breathe space. some give assistance, able increase capital. we convince take kind risk beneficial economy, notably lend smes. it also note demand credit declined. some firms, experience fall sale lack visibility regard future, hesitant investing, large firm increasingly turn markets, finance issue bonds. last year, bond issuance firm total €34 billion, offset contraction loan around €20 billion. will bank supervision work ecb task reveal presence lehman brother among europe’s bank groups? it difficult say stage. country greece, portugal, ireland spain, give financial assistance, already take step consolidate bank networks. in addition, regulator ask bank make provision non-performing loan increase capital order ensure solvency. but yes – need ascertain precise situation, 2014 priority new european bank supervision mechanism, head danièle nouÿ. bi central bankers’ speech 3 ha ecb do stimulate growth? in context mandate, yes. and always ready able act late stage. we already deploy instrument context accommodative monetary policy, despite fact certain people accuse u take enormous risk endanger price stability. we see nothing sort. on contrary, action desire effect. we remain determine today ensure price stability safeguard integrity euro. but ecb cannot alone. we governments’ work them. it undertake fundamental reforms, support innovation manage public spend – short, come new model growth. be ecb prisoner german budgetary orthodoxy term interpretation mandate? the ecb act treaties, ratify european countries. the treaty require country ensure sustainability public finances. and question common sense. look happen credibility certain countries’ public finance deteriorate point access market compromised. they undergo painful adjustment programme refer to. it unsustainable debt deficit level render country prisoner markets. some people would like see ecb fight combat unemployment, like federal reserve. why refuse that? our main task maintain price stability. of course, insofar action stabilise economy, help reduce unemployment. however, cannot reduce structural level unemployment, dependent smooth function labour market ability good integrate exclude it. take example german growth, come reduction interest rate (although helped), rather reform previous years. the euro strengthen considerably u dollar. what counter make euro competitive? i desire speculate regard right euro/us dollar exchange rate. we objective term exchange rates. however, i recognise high exchange rate consequence growth inflation europe. which fear more: deflation return inflation? neither one other. we experience deflation. price fall sufficiently strong generalise manner entail postponement purchase investment, thus kind economic slowdown saw japan. inflation low level, well 2% threshold, remain weak 2015. that decide reduce key interest rates, order buff curb decline. what answer grow number european long want euro? i would tell euro basis future. the euro sound currency, one entirely fulfil role, suffer fact monetary union incomplete imperfect. we need complete monetary union want truly achieve last stability prosperity europe. first all, need move forward bank union complete reform deficit reduction programme embark on. the populist argument that, leave euro, national economy 4 bi central bankers’ speech instantly benefit competitive devaluation, good old days, hold water. if everybody try devalue currency, nobody benefits. ultimately, road prosperity always go via reform search productivity innovation. do dread anti-european vote election may? i expect strong anti-european presence european parliament relative today. we conscious respond distrust become entrench public opinion come european project institutions. there doubt populist movement capitalise sentiment, also people genuinely disappointed. it u explain euro remain mark progress, currency future. it u point european integration prove best way safeguard peace. however, also need give community renew sense purpose – explain europe great integration contribute progress, economic recovery prosperity. we give people fresh hope. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardo hansson: nordic-baltic financial linkage challenge open remark mr ardo hansson, governor bank estonia (eesti pank), conference “nordic-baltic financial linkage challenges”, tallinn, 13 december 2013. * * * i honor welcome tallinn conference nordic-baltic financial linkage challenge jointly organize imf, riksbank eesti pank. jean monnet famously say europe sum decision take crises. we hope soon put one crisis behind us. we know inadequate assessment risk weakness regulatory supervisory framework among cause crisis. we hope lesson learn crisis profound last enough provide energy u follow fundamental reform initiate eu. we also understand need remain vigilant ready act possible new risk financial stability. today’s conference take close look challenge reward involve evolution new paradigm operation regulation european financial sector. the financial sector nordic-baltic region regularly use example regional integration cooperation. in remarks, i would like highlight key feature region put broad context european developments. take care large nordic-baltic “home market” first all, keep mind nordic-baltic region characterize considerable diversity: diversity monetary policy frameworks, model economic development financial structures. the second key word nordic-baltic region integration – region characterize tight trade financial tie within region well europe global markets. therefore, region’s competitiveness growth potential important country region. the bank group finance growth region largely every country. all group currently highly rat well capitalize comparison others europe. a result merger natural growth, total asset large bank rise high level compare regional gdp, mention high level ratio gdp home countries. the combination common economic interest financial sector integration foster emergence unique feature nordic bank groups: extend concept “home market” well beyond home country’s borders. for example, nordic parent bank continue provide liquidity baltic affiliate even year deep crisis baltic economies. in today’s slow growth environment, remain important competitiveness growth appropriate level finance whole region. the broad concept “home market” develop further. one challenge ensure strong competition retail market benefit integration could felt consumer across region. foster sustainable growth region require u take systemic view design harmonize regulation financial sector, quality proactivity macro-prudential supervision become important. the nordic-baltic dimension add two nuance design macro-prudential policies. first, experience past decade stark reminder particular challenge manage capital flow highly integrate economy financial sectors. second, large nordic bank group consider big fail almost country region. 2 bi central bankers’ speech diversity financial sector structure challenge cross-border cooperation a i say earlier, economy financial sector nordic-baltic region diverse well closely integrated. different country region opt different policy frameworks; structure financial sector also differ country. it turn region eight countries, small, one need tackle much array problem make coordination financial sector policy supervision challenge europe. there home host countries; non-eu member states, eu member states, euro area member states. there difference economic, lend asset price cycles, also difference economic history, crisis experience institutional arrangements. the development recent year exacerbate dissimilarity perhaps even create new ones. it appear success combine positive aspect diversity integration nordic-baltic region may serve model european union. if cooperation coordination possible region, reason hope european union whole. cooperation institution responsible financial stability region history 10 years. this cooperation become considerably close since outbreak global financial crisis reversal capital flow countries. routine work do supervisory colleges, high-level multilateral group coordinate macro-prudential supervision crisis management. it important trust open communication well mutual support willingness take responsibility remain place financial stability nordic-baltic country really stake. a share understand need deal macroeconomic financial stability risk national level provide solid foundation nordic-baltic cooperation. 2014 bring new challenge europe the year 2014 bring new challenges. new financial sector regulation (i refer crr/crd forthcoming brrd) single bank supervision add new aspect new partner nordic-baltic cooperation. the goal harmonisation cross-border regulatory supervisory practice create operate environment bank financial institution foster mutual trust help ensure provision financial service continuous satisfy need real economy. when ssm become operational, important effect routine supervisory work nordic-baltic region. the home country several subsidiary include direct supervision ssm/ecb probably remain outside ssm. this present new challenge nordic-baltic cooperation framework. in light success regional cooperation rational build new principle supervision exist foundation wherever possible. i hope believe new complex framework able preserve important value – spirit cooperation. in view development single market also important build bank union complete – ssm must follow srm. ideally, would create balance right responsibility guide principle safeguard cross-border financial stability nearly decade. there doubt special feature nordic-baltic region complicate agreement joint crisis management, design cooperation matter crucial. *** lady gentlemen, it great honour privilege host conference issue highly topical region also europe globally. the conference bring together bi central bankers’ speech 3 prominent speaker audience great potential provide different viewpoint discussions. in light today’s topic, let u also consider value make nordic-baltic region successful. let u consider preserve build upon value possibly share rest europe. and finally, let u exaggerate difficulty cooperation; let u underestimate reward success risk stem inaction. build foundation future nordic-baltic finance fainthearted. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fritz zurbrügg: financial markets, management swiss currency reserve interest rate benchmark reform introductory remark mr fritz zurbrügg, member govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 12 december 2013. * * * i begin today look situation financial markets. then i talk briefly development foreign exchange holdings. i close comment progress make reform interest rate benchmark international national level. situation financial market since last medium news conference june, positive risk sentiment financial market largely maintained, evident soar share prices, among things. in past weeks, key u index dow jones s&p 500 reach new record levels, thereby exceed peak attain prior global financial crisis. in addition, japan’s nikkei index important western european stock exchange indices, include swiss smi, record significant gain recent months. despite euphoria stock exchanges, must forget improvement economic outlook also continuation expansionary monetary policy around world behind positive risk sentiment. in may june saw could happen expectation le expansionary monetary policy course become widespread market. at time, announcement u federal reserve possible reduction bond purchase programme cause share market plunge temporarily. the wave sell recede begin july, federal reserve, european central bank bank england reassure market key rate would remain low level recovery individual economy firm foundation. on bond markets, interest rate continue rise june july. since then, largely move sideways. this apply us, uk, german swiss government bonds, particular. until begin september, yield ten-year confederation bond rise almost 1.2%. they currently around 1%, mean increase half percent year-on-year. government bond emerge economy particularly strongly affect rise interest rates, since expectation impend monetary policy normalisation u lead significant capital outflow countries. by contrast, risk premia government bond peripheral euro area economy increase much. moreover, risk premia fall meantime return government bond peripheral economy fact low begin year. this probably due, least, progress overcome crisis well encourage economic data euro area. however, investor still cautious, demand still high investment see safe havens. consequently, recent months, swiss franc move narrow range minimum exchange rate chf 1.20. nevertheless, view progress euro area, many market participant expect swiss franc depreciate. despite progress, still early all-clear. condition financial market could change rapidly. in order counteract possible tension financial market lessen potential impact economy, six lead central bank include swiss 2 bi central bankers’ speech national bank (snb) convert reciprocal swap line stand arrangement october. these swap line initially arrange temporary basis height financial crisis, order secure access liquidity. development foreign exchange reserve at end september 2013, hold foreign exchange reserve stand chf 443 billion. i would like make comment income foreign exchange reserves. i begin stress monetary policy priority investment policy, generate income primary objective investment policy. we guided, first all, criterion security liquidity. the criterion security cover primarily reduction risk market, credit concentration risks. in addition, important u maintain real value foreign exchange reserve long term. consequently, long-term return investment must match average rate inflation. if criterion security liquidity fulfilled, investment policy aim achieve additional return real maintenance value. the return foreign exchange reserve make current income plus change value investments. the income take form interest dividend payment bond shareholdings. in view current low interest rate environment, amount around 2% foreign exchange reserve per year. just like investment fall due, income generally reinvested. therefore, foreign exchange reserve tend rise even need purchase additional foreign exchange. the component return change value foreign exchange reserves. we value investment market price swiss francs. consequently, change price interest-bearing paper share well exchange rate movement direct impact net result investment. if swiss franc strengthen investment currencies, result valuation loss foreign exchange reserves. the chart show net investment result since first quarter 2010 foreign exchange reserves, well individual components. the dominant role exchange rate movement clearly evident. in past, too, exchange rate movement pose far great risk portfolio. take long-term view, exchange rate responsible 80% total risk foreign currency reserves. reform interest rate benchmark follow last year’s revelation libor interest rate manipulated, various activity reform libor interest rate benchmark way. the snb involve reform activity international national level. the objective improve credibility acceptance exist interest rate benchmark or, appropriate, take step ensure provision robust alternative interest rate benchmarks. international effort coordinate financial stability board behalf g20 countries. they involve central bank supervisory authority also international group private sector financial market participants. they examining, first, extent exist libor interest rate fulfil requirement lay security supervisor last july (the iosco standards). second, investigate whether alternative interest rate benchmark would good meet need market requirement supervisory authority long term. alternative libor develop private sector group, also include swiss representatives. the financial stability board plan present result work middle next year. at international level, activity also way regulate interest rate benchmark well important reference variable financial markets. in bi central bankers’ speech 3 london, libor already subject supervisory regime. in brussels, bill propose would regulate interest rate benchmark use eu. in switzerland, too, need regulatory action likely emerge area. at national level, snb finma talk financial market participant ensure robust construction interest rate benchmark fix switzerland. the aim widen data pool improve calculation methods, focus reference interest rate short-term swiss franc transactions, specifically one-day terms. these transaction form basis swiss franc yield curve. the two benchmark involve are, first, tois fixing, use interest rate derivative swiss franc money market, second, saron, serf basis yield curve swiss franc repo market. progress already achieve interest rate benchmarks. although level activity money market remain persistently low, continue available market basis interest rate transaction swiss francs. however, libor retain position important interest rate benchmark money capital markets. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît coeuré: interview die zeit interview mr benoît coeuré, member executive board european central bank, die zeit, conduct mr mark schieritz publish 9 december 2013. * * * mr cœuré, know interest rate save account germany is? very low, probably close 0%. that’s correct. some bank pay 0.25% even less. can relate saver germany annoy european central bank (ecb) make foot bill crisis? rate low euro area economy weak. take example low long-term interest rate german government bonds, important life insurance contract pensions. why exactly weak economy responsible low rates? if growth weak, profitable investment opportunities. a save need invest order achieve returns, mean return low. low market rate also, however, create condition new growth also boost future return savings. so say german saver benefit ecb’s low rates? my message is: important differentiate long-term rate saver policy rate ecb. long-term rate low economy weak. in circumstances, ecb set policy rate way ensure price stability. thereby support economy create condition profitable investment opportunity – also benefit german savers. so would say german worry retirement provision? i would tell best way improve return save crisis solve quickly possible. this mean economic reform implement stress countries, also mean complete measure design make euro area whole safer. we need, all, function bank union german government bond safe asset euro area anymore. if germany still deutsche mark, interest rate would higher. i don’t want speculate hypothetical issues. our currency euro. but look switzerland: country currency interest rate extremely low nevertheless, namely investor consider safe like germany. you mention price stability. inflation currently low. where’s harm that? it is, all, question confidence. the ecb commit maintain price stability, mean keep inflation below, close to, 2% – achieve objective. average inflation since introduction euro 2.03%. this contribute economic stability europe. if miss objective, people would start question commitment. that also hold tolerate inflation rate low. we cannot risk loss confidence. the main reason current low level inflation price cost adjustment crisis countries, thereby enable country become competitive. it good economy need regain competitiveness adjust. but adjustment much easy inflation euro area whole stand 2%, rather than, say, 1%. 2 bi central bankers’ speech why? we know experience that, least europe, difficult cut nominal wages. if price rising, get desire effect – cost labour decline real term – hold nominal wage constant. this major central bank world seek eliminate inflation completely. inflation low, positive level. the inflation rate euro area currently 0.9%. if take word, ecb fact job. it true that, result weak economy, little scope price increase. but expect rate inflation come back 2% medium term. accord staff projections, inflation target 2015. what mean medium term? we give precise time frame, certainly talk decade generation. if country south low inflation rate ecb want keep overall inflation 2%, mean logically germany accept high inflation. it goal policy artificially increase inflation germany. but german economy keep well, wage increase, inflation naturally also increase somewhat. that result market decisions. what important u average inflation euro area whole return objective. and not? we cut interest rate last month come conclusion inflation would stay target long. look ahead, come conclusion remain case, would act again. this scenario stage, however. we confident inflation gradually come back 2%, mainly euro area economy come recession. but course monitor situation carefully. i want rule steps. interest rate already close zero. what could do? there number thing could do. we could cut interest rate again, by, say, move deposit rate negative territory, could provide additional liquidity bank sector. which option – – use depend economic developments. we could also combine measures. a crisis europe, would say bad over? i would say bad financial crisis narrow sense over. the main task european authority year last year stabilise financial markets. this largely successful: market much calm confidence european recovery now. the main task next year get economy going. some people germany say france, home country, big risk monetary union. i would certainly call france risk term financial stability. the french financial bank system resilient. there currently danger whatsoever country may lose access financial markets. the problem growth could remain weak reform take forward. company increase competitiveness government get budget control cut public spending. bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas jordan: global economic outlook economic development switzerland introductory remark mr thomas jordan, chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 12 december 2013. * * * lady gentleman welcome swiss national bank’s news conference. i would like begin today explain snb’s monetary policy decision move present assessment economic situation monetary conditions. my colleague, jean-pierre danthine, talk development connection financial stability banknotes. finally, colleague, fritz zurbrügg, look current situation financial markets, well management currency reserve interest rate benchmark reforms. a always, conclude question answer session. i start monetary policy decision. a doubt expected, snb maintain minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro. the swiss franc still high. with three-month libor already practically zero, minimum exchange rate continue right tool ensure appropriate monetary condition switzerland. if swiss franc appreciate, would significant consequence swiss economy. on one hand, appreciation would lead decline import price renew threat deflation. in regard, bear mind inflation last two year predominantly negative. on hand, ongoing unfavourable international environment strong swiss franc, situation economy remain challenging. should become necessary, therefore enforce minimum exchange rate buy foreign currency unlimited quantities. and, required, also take measures. in addition, leave target range three-month libor 0.0–0.25%. the snb base monetary policy decision conditional inflation forecast, assume unchanged three-month libor 0.0% next three years. you find relevant chart medium kit. compare september, forecast adjust downwards slightly. reason unexpectedly low rate inflation october november, serve low departure point forecast, well decline inflation euro area slight fall oil price, help dampen inflation outlook. for 2013, still anticipate inflation –0.2%. for 2014 2015, inflation forecast case 0.1 percentage point 0.2% 0.6% respectively. consequently, inflation risk identify switzerland foreseeable future. global economic outlook the snb’s inflation forecast embed global economic scenario. i would therefore like begin assessment global economy. global economic recovery continue expect recent months, main driver us, uk china. in euro area, contrast, growth lack momentum inflation slow considerably expected. in many emerge economies, too, economic activity rather sluggish. the outlook global economy change significantly since september monetary policy assessment. our forecast suggest growth pick gradually 2 bi central bankers’ speech come quarters. further recovery likely underpin number factors, include stable international financial markets, le restrictive fiscal policy expansionary monetary policy major advance economies. europe, however, continue experience below-average growth, banks’ restrain lend policy ongoing uncertainty hamper investment activity. in addition, high level unemployment region also hold back private consumption. uncertainty continue recovery global economy remain high overall. in many advance economies, room manoeuvre economic policy constrain fact interest rate already low government indebtedness high, make global economy especially prone shocks. we expect euro area overcome crisis medium term. however, forthcoming assessment banks’ balance sheet could cause ripples. furthermore, exit unconventional monetary policy measure yet uncharted territory. spike international financial market therefore cannot rule process normalise monetary policy major currency areas. swiss economic outlook i look economic development switzerland. the economy continue develop favourably third quarter. annualised real gdp slightly 2%. unlike previous quarter, good export grow substantially. domestic demand, however, lose momentum. on output side, manufacture particular record positive growth, previously fall three successive quarters. construction continue important growth driver. owe positive growth, utilisation production capacity pick up. nevertheless, remain relatively low level manufacturing. employment increase slightly seasonally adjust unemployment rate rise since summer. overall, output gap remain negative. the indicator already available suggest growth weaken temporarily fourth quarter. follow sharp increase third quarter, good export industrial output, particular, likely advance slow pace. in come year, gradual improvement global economy, gdp grow strongly. we continue expect growth 1.5–2.0% 2013. for 2014, expect growth rate around 2.0%. however, give vulnerable economic situation abroad, downside risk still prevail switzerland. monetary financial condition i turn monetary financial conditions. last summer, spark debate possible reduction u federal reserve’s bond purchase programme, long-term interest rate rise across globe. switzerland exception. the recent interest rate reduction european central bank (ecb), contrast, little effect switzerland. one possible reason money market rate euro area already low level ecb’s decision fall further. since october 2011, inflation rate switzerland predominantly negative. the introduction minimum exchange rate september 2011 prevent severe deflationary trend, however. low price level switzerland reflect, one hand, impact past appreciation swiss franc import good prices. on hand, price development show clearly domestic company low cost improve price competitiveness. more two year introduction bi central bankers’ speech 3 minimum exchange rate, effect weaken considerably; also reflect current path inflation. at time, inflation abroad receding, especially euro area. the inflation differential switzerland euro area thus decrease significantly. inflation differential play important role valuation swiss franc. this decrease inflation differential mean real effective exchange rate hardly change remain considerably long-term average. unless substantial nominal depreciation, current high value swiss franc therefore continue. growth m1, m2 m3 monetary aggregate perceptibly weak since summer; primarily attributable rise long-term interest rates. liquidity hold household company nevertheless remain high. in past, sustain high level liquidity generally point inflation risks. a result financial crisis, however, correlation cannot currently made. thus, recent years, inflation rate remain exceptionally low despite high level liquidity. at present, sign rise inflation switzerland. our inflation forecast show risk inflation whatsoever. in addition, survey inflation expectation reveal value consistent definition price stability. this apply short-term inflation expectations, also long-term horizon ten years. furthermore, production capacity switzerland still underutilised, also make rapid rise inflation unlikely. snb monetary policy in conclusion, i would like look snb’s monetary policy. overall economic condition hardly change since summer. consequently, monetary policy remain challenge snb. up now, economy perform relatively well, consider difficult international environment. and enforce minimum exchange rate foreign currency purchase since september 2012. financial market expect short-term interest rate stay low worldwide time come. furthermore, development global economy likely remain uncertain. in environment, minimum exchange rate continue essential ensure appropriate monetary condition switzerland. the guide principle decision snb’s mandate ensure price stability take due account development economy. the financial crisis also show us, however, price stability alone sufficient ensure financial sector remain stable. in connection, situation mortgage real estate market – show considerable momentum – cause concern quite time now. also, mortgage lend still grow fast gdp, result aggregate debt increase further. the countercyclical capital buff new tool resilience bank strengthen imbalance mortgage real estate market addressed. my colleague, jean-pierre danthine, give assessment risk financial stability. lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 raghuram rajan: financial sector reform talk dr raghuram rajan, governor reserve bank india, delhi economics conclave 2013, delhi, 11 december 2013. * * * the economy stabilizing, room complacency. some part improvement cad happen due suppress gold imports. not measure reduce fiscal deficit high quality. we considerable work still. at time country face election next year. a stable government post elections, likely, cannot take granted. this imply party work together today ensure government emerge post-election time come term challenge manage indian economy. otherwise, market rat agency may will cut new government slack. more generally, would overly complacent possibly dangerous party postpone necessary legislation idea pas bill post-election. post-election politics may become even challenging, whoever assume power. similarly, slowdown put large stall project back track election fiscal slippage, amplify already large challenge new government face. it benefit nation enormously parliament pass key bill current authority continue take action improve growth fiscal health, include raise diesel price market level eliminate poorly target subsidies. this conclave, however, medium term. look medium term, measure success job created; create give government subsidy protection labour-intensive industry sector develop facilitating, competitive, environment encourage efficiency creativity. the job agenda require discipline focus 4 issues: 1) we need improve quality infrastructure, especially logistical support power industry service need. grand plan anvil, delhi-mumbai industrial corridor. we need complete project time, within budget. the success new delhi metro suggest timeliness cost control foreign indian psyche. 2) our youth need education train job created. some high degrees, computer science also design civil engineering. some appropriate vocational education teach good plumber electrician rather unemployable low-skilled engineers. in fact, teach citizen step stone teach world. india forefront provide mass technology-enabled education professor provide appropriate human input achieve best mix automation customisation learning. 3) we need good business regulation. this always mean le regulation mean regulation appropriate objective and, enforced. entrepreneur tell boiler inspector show software outfits, ask location boiler. the lack change may sheer inertia, may sinister rent-seeking. all often, much regulation book little regulation practice, bad regulate find unscrupulous way around regulation honest stymied. even open business legitimately require enormous number clearance paperwork. in way saral form file income tax, could saral one page disclosure open small business, single authority give necessary permissions? 2 bi central bankers’ speech 4) and finally, need good financial system, finance need infrastructure expansion every producer range kirana shop owner industrialist. but finance credit. equally important household able save safely positive real returns, insure health emergency old age costs, borrow low cost finance consumption. they able make remittance cheaply pay low cost. importantly, financial system require constant subsidy bail out. in rest talk, i want focus we, reserve bank, improve financial system. we plan build reserve bank’s developmental measure next quarter five pillars. these are: 1. clarify strengthen monetary policy framework. 2. strengthen bank structure new entry, branch expansion, encourage new variety banks, move foreign bank good regulate organizational forms. 3. broaden deepen financial market increase liquidity resilience help allocate absorb risk entail finance india’s growth. 4. expand access finance small medium enterprises, unorganized sector, poor, remote underserved area country technology, new business practices, new organizational structures; is, need financial inclusion. 5. improve system’s ability deal corporate distress financial institution distress strengthen real financial restructure well debt recovery. let elaborate measure little. first, among large country high consumer price inflation world, even though growth weak would like be. much inflation concentrate food services. our household turn gold find financial investment unattractive. at time, many industrial corporation complain high interest rate cannot pas high cost high price products. we spend long time debate source inflation. but ultimately, inflation come demand exceed supply, curtail bring balance. we need reduce demand somewhat without serious adverse effect investment supply. this balance act, require reserve bank act firmly economy disinflating, even allow weak economy time one would normally allow reach comfortable level inflation. the weak state economy, recent stability rupee, well good kharif rabi harvest year, generate disinflationary force help, await data see force play out. no single data point number determine next move. i think market understand try do. but need carefully spell monetary policy framework currently have. action framework follow submission dr. urjit patel committee report, expect submit report end december 2013. second, already announce measure free bank branching. we also want incentivize foreign bank incorporate domestically, rbi plan since 2005. this allow u regulate good reduce risk contagion, stem foreign shores. this necessary measure ensure stability bank system. it measure many country embarked. go forward, give public sector banks, national asset, mean improve competitiveness. many make enormous stride last decade – bi central bankers’ speech 3 instance, extent digitize operation extremely praiseworthy – competition bank sector likely increase next years, cannot rest laurels. in come months, discus stakeholder public sector bank need do improve stability, efficiency productivity. third, need enlist market aid financial institutions. liquid market help bank offload risk bear, interest rate exchange risk. they also allow bank sell asset comparative advantage holding, long term loan complete infrastructure projects, good hold infrastructure funds, pension funds, insurance companies. liquid market help promoter raise equity, sorely need indian economy absorb risk bank otherwise end absorbing. rather see market inimical development bank sector, see complimentary. in come weeks, roll measure improve liquidity depth g-sec market. we turn money market corporate debt markets. we introduce new variant interest rate future product like inflation index certificates, continue work improve liquidity derivative markets. a exchange market become unstable, impose restriction participation markets. we remove restriction calibrate fashion. fourth, reach everyone, however remote small, financial services. financial inclusion mean credit productive purposes, mean credit pay doctor heal child pay lumpy school college fees. it mean safe mode remunerate savings, easy way make payment remittances. it mean insurance pensions. it also mean financial literacy consumer protection. we make great stride inclusion, still distance goal. we adopt branch base strategy inclusion, enough. too many poor people so-called “over-branched” urban area still access bank services. we many experiment way use technology, mobile phones, new product mobile wallets, new entity business correspondent link people formal financial system. much cell phone create frugal indian model, need frugal, trustworthy, effective indian model financial inclusion. the dr. nachiket mor committee help u think possible models, i hopeful outline measure base recommendations, fine banks, nbfcs, it company mobile player rise occasion. the key encourage entity compete serve customer bottom pyramid. we tolerate make profit profiteering, enhance effort consumer protection consumer literacy accordingly. and last least, deal good distress; we ensure system recognize financial distress early, take step resolve it, ensure fair recovery lender investors. we could wish effective judicial process good bankruptcy system, await that, improve function have. next week, propose put paper discussion focus put real asset back work best use. the key element deal distress borrower include: (i) early formation lender committee timeline reach agreement plan resolution. (ii) strong incentive lender agree collectively quickly plan – involve good regulatory treatment stress asset resolution plan formulate agree to, accelerate provision agreement reached. 4 bi central bankers’ speech (iii) a mandate independent evaluation large value restructurings, focus plan viability fair share loss (and future possible upside) promoter creditors. (iv) more expensive future borrow wilful defaulter uncooperative defaulter work lender achieve efficient equitable resolution distress assets. (v) more liberal regulatory treatment asset sale encouragement new entity purchase refinance assets. the lesson every period financial stress across economy early recognition resolution problem give economy best chance robust recovery. through measure outline next week, rbi intend help promoter bank deal effectively financial stress build up. let conclude. i depart usual conservatism central banker predict best india yet come. we healthier, good educated, rich nation, absolute terms, even relative countries. this jingoistic statement base intrinsic indian superiority sober recognition still much poor countries, catch always easy draw away pack. but achieve outcome go address challenge face methodically, discipline sense national purpose. in come years, i hope do.
